{"Title": "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The period spy thriller \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d is only\r\nintermittently engaging and amusing, and those portions of the movie that\r\nsucceed are also frustrating. Because they\u2019re cushioned by enervated,\r\nconceptually befuddled, and sometimes outright indifferent stuff.  Adapted from the genuine-article 1960s television series,\r\nwhich paired steely, no-nonsense, mid-Atlantic-accented veteran spy Napoleon\r\nSolo with younger slightly petulant Russian moptop Ilya Kuryakin,\r\nco-writer/director Guy Ritchie\u2019s film situates itself in an early Cold War\r\nwherein J.F.K. is still giving inspiring speeches. This movie\u2019s Solo (Henry\r\nCavill) struts his bespoke-suited self right into East Berlin to spirit out\r\nfeisty femme auto mechanic Gaby (Alicia Vikander), whose dad is an A-bomb\r\nexpert now working, apparently against his will with some neo-fascist Italian\r\nshipping magnates out to spread nuke terror. Solo\u2019s here working for the\r\nC.I.A.; hot on his trail is strong-jawed, Terminator-strong Kuryakin (Armie\r\nHammer). A chase ensues with all three parties ducking each other and Kuryakin\r\nactually ripping the trunk door off of one of the cars involved. Solo and Gaby\r\ncross the Berlin Wall by means of a sort of zipline; imagine Solo\u2019s surprise\r\nwhen he soon learns that for his next mission he has to collaborate with the\r\nKGB agent who almost had him for dinner.  Advertisement A gruff Agency honcho Jared Harris, approximating a Texan\r\naccent, delivers the news and he and his KGB counterpart debrief the unhappy\r\nnew partners at a crowded outdoor caf\u00e9. Why these guys are spilling\r\ninternational secrets in a setting where they can be effortlessly overheard is\r\nthe source for one of the movie\u2019s better visual gags. Alas, the movie doesn\u2019t\r\nhave too many more \u201cgotcha!\u201ds in its bag. The two spies soon touch down in\r\nItaly, where they flirt\u2014Ilya with Gaby, and Solo with one of the neo-fascists,\r\na blah femme fatale played by Elizabeth Debicki\u2014and do spy stuff. In this\r\nmovie\u2019s reimagining of the characters, Solo has a backstory as a master thief,\r\nwhile Ilya is a chess-obsessed strong man with rage and daddy issues. This\r\ngives Cavill and Hammer amusing bits to enact, but, and here\u2019s a big rub,\r\nwhatever it is that Cavill and Hammer are supposed to bring to this movie, they\r\ndon\u2019t. They fill out their clothes very nicely, it\u2019s true, but other than that\r\nthey are to charisma what black holes are to matter. \u201cFlat\u201d really doesn\u2019t begin\r\nto cover it.  Then there\u2019s the direction. Ritchie clearly wants to revel\r\nin a pre-swinging-\u201860s vibe, but he either can\u2019t or won\u2019t commit to it in a way\r\nthat yields any actual fun. Possibly he\u2019s wary of bumping up against \u201cAustin\r\nPowers\u201d-style pastiche, but whatever the cause, when he\u2019s not being incoherent,\r\nhe\u2019s being fussy. Even the soundtrack has a kind of stick up its fundament;\r\nit\u2019s chock full of the Right Names in early \u201860s international (and largely\r\nItalian) pop, but it\u2019s largely lacking in infectiousness. Seriously, they could\r\nhave thrown in a \u201cTake It East My Brother Charlie\u201d or something and only a jerk\r\nlike me would have pointed out the anachronism.  There are times when the movie uses its leads\u2019 lack of\r\naffect in service of a cheeky sense of humor, as in Solo\u2019s sojourn in the cab\r\nof a truck, after a frantic chase scene, sitting out (or so it seems) a\r\nnear-fatal brush with danger for partner Ilya. But much of the time Richie\r\nseems uninterested in the action, although a final chase featuring a jeep, a\r\nskeletal ATV, and a motorcycle unspools like a choose-your-own-adventure video\r\ngame, and I mean that in a good way. But the misfires are just as memorable, as\r\nwhen Richie and company use realistic evocations of Nazi atrocities to fill out\r\nthe character of one minor villain. And if you were lucky enough to have seen\r\nVikander in \u201cEx Machina\u201d (and if you haven\u2019t been you ought to change that),\r\nyou\u2019ll be profoundly appreciative of just how much she\u2019s wasted here. She\u2019s\r\nadorable anyway, however.  Advertisement While it can\u2019t be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his\r\nreturn to prominence in the last half hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on\r\nearlier in the movie, peps things up considerably. Grant\u2019s character is the one\r\nthat pulls the whole \u201cU.N.C.L.E.\u201d concept together, birthing an agency in which\r\nKGB, C.I.A., and MI6 or 5 or whatever it is can cooperate to prevent mutual\r\nassured destruction or something like that. Kind of like that agency in that\r\nother summer spy thriller that this summer spy thriller is not going to present\r\nany serious competition to. In any event, an entire movie in which the\r\nweathered but still debonair Grant played the bluff, amiable puppetmaster to\r\nthe two hunky ciphers might have been great fun. I gather that Richie and\r\ncompany still want to make that movie. I have mixed feelings about whether they\r\nought to, or will.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
