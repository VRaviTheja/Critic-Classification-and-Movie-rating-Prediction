{"Title": "American Honey", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "An essential element of youth is movement. Where are we\r\ngoing? What are we doing when we get there? There\u2019s an energy to the hazy days\r\nof those teenage years that\u2019s hard to capture on film\u2014a sense of constant\r\nmotion toward an uncertain future. It\u2019s often a push and pull between what we\r\nwant to do and what we\u2019re ready for, as phrased in the song that gives Andrea\r\nArnold\u2019s \u201cAmerican Honey\u201d its name: \u201cSteady as a preacher/Free as a weed/Couldn\u2019t\r\nwait to get goin\u2019/But wasn\u2019t quite ready to leave.\u201d This brilliant European\r\nfilmmaker\u2019s look at youth culture in the middle of America is full of\r\nexaggerated imagery of the heartland of the United States\u2014men in cowboy hats\r\ngrilling meat by a pool, oil fields blazing at night, a trucker listening to\r\nThe Boss, an extravagant teenage girl\u2019s birthday party\u2014but its beating heart is\r\nin a story of youth. Reckless, fearless, joyous, always-moving youth.  Advertisement We meet Star (Sasha Lane) in a dumpster, looking for food.\r\nQuickly, she encounters a group of teenagers in a nearby mega-store and sees a\r\nchance to escape her unhappy home life. This group of smiling, jumping, dancing\r\npeople, led by a flirtatious Jake (Shia LaBeouf), offer a way out for Star.\r\nWhere they\u2019re going to take her isn\u2019t as important as the idea that they\u2019re\r\ngoing somewhere, anywhere other than here. She learns that Jake is one of the\r\nleaders of the group, who travel the country selling magazines door to door.\r\nThey really just do it enough to get food and lodging so they can keep doing\r\nit. They\u2019re living day to day\u2014partying, drinking, and singing their way across\r\nthe country. \u00a0 There are scant few traditional narrative elements to \u201cAmerican\r\nHoney.\u201d There\u2019s a bit of a villain in Riley Keough\u2019s Krystal, the head of the\r\nmagazine sales group who collects the cash and makes the assignments. And there\u2019s\r\nan inevitable bit of a love story between Star and Jake, although it\u2019s not a\r\nfilm anyone could call a romance. This is a not a film tied to plot. It often\r\nfollows Star on adventures in the magazine sales trade, bringing her back to\r\nthe group after random encounters across the country. And it is a film in which\r\npeople convey emotion more through action and music than dialogue. When they\u2019re\r\nhappy, they dance\u2014Arnold\u2019s film is filled with pop songs, many of which are\r\nplayed in their entirety. When they sing along, they\u2019re expressing the feeling\r\nof community they have created and that they need so badly. There\u2019s a key\r\nmoment near the end in which they all start slowly singing along to the same\r\ntune, almost one line at a time, until they are all together\u2014multiple voices in\r\ncommon song.  Arnold shoots \u201cAmerican Honey\u201d in her typical full-frame\r\n1.33:1 style and it creates a visually fascinating aesthetic. One might think\r\nthat it would hamper a film that could have so easily taken advantage of the\r\nwidescreen vistas of the heart of the country, but it\u2019s effective because it\r\nkeeps us with our characters instead of visually wandering the landscape. It\r\ncreates a privacy, a sense that we\u2019re in the van with Star and the rest of the\r\ngang, joining them on this journey. And Arnold and cinematographer Robbie Ryan\r\noften shoot their teenagers from below, casting them larger than life against\r\nthe blue sky. Advertisement Most of the supporting cast appear to be non-professionals\r\nwho are improvising much of their dialogue, and they\u2019re all natural and\r\nengaging\u2014a testament to Arnold\u2019s direction. The real find here is Lane, who\r\nmakes her feature debut confidently, never feeling like she\u2019s performing as\r\nmuch as living in the moment. LaBeouf has a ragged energy. We get the sense\r\nthat he\u2019s worked with a few Stars along the way, and while Arnold never explicitly\r\ngives him a detailed back story, one can sense that LaBeouf created one. Jake\r\nis confident but also needs the reassurance of people like Krystal and\r\neventually Star as he probably senses his youthful days are coming to an end. It\u2019s\r\na rich, complex performance. Ultimately, \u201cAmerican Honey\u201d is about motion\u2014a van of kids\r\nspeeding down the freeway. Even when they stop at a motel to break, they use\r\nthe chance to dance in the parking lot. We all remember those years when we\r\ncouldn\u2019t sit still\u2014when hormones, ambition, and just the desire to see what was\r\naround the next corner kept us unsettled and needing to move. Andrea Arnold\u2019s\r\nphenomenal work captures that propulsive teenage trait as well as anything in\r\nyears. There is no yesterday, there is no today, there is only moving forward to\r\ntomorrow.", "Critic": "Beta"}
