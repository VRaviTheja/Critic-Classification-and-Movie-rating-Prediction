{"Title": "Snowden", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "If Edward Snowden didn\u2019t exist, Oliver Stone might have\r\ninvented him. One can imagine a Stone film about a former employee of the U.S.\r\ngovernment who becomes disillusioned with his country when he learns the depth\r\nof its deceit. In fact, that last sentence could describe a few Stone films,\r\nand so \u201cSnowden\u201d has been widely anticipated as a return to form for the\r\ndirector of masterpieces like \u201cPlatoon,\u201d \u201cJFK\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s his first film in four years and his first with a true story behind it in\r\nalmost a decade (\u201cW.\u201d). Advertisement History will recognize Stone as one of the most\r\nimportant cinematic historians when it comes to the stories of his country,\r\nfrom Vietnam to Richard Nixon to 9/11. And so it makes perfect sense that he\r\nwould be attracted to the story of Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who\r\nrevealed the scope of just how little privacy we have in a post-9/11 world.\r\nStone made the very smart move to hire a committed, underrated actor to play\r\nthe challenging lead role, and the result is a film that thrives off its\r\ncentral performance. Some of the elements around that performance are a bit\r\nlacking, especially the script, but there\u2019s an energy here that Stone hasn\u2019t\r\nhad in a few films, as if he's been enlivened by a subject he was destined to\r\ndocument. \u201cSnowden\u201d actually opens with a scene that will be very\r\nfamiliar to viewers of the Oscar-winning \u201cCitizenfour\u201d\u2014that film\u2019s director,\r\nLaura Poitras (Melissa Leo), and journalist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto)\r\nare going to meet Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who then recounts the last few years of his\r\nlife under extreme cover (cell phones go in the microwave, for example). The\r\nstructure of Kieran Fitzgerald and Stone\u2019s script essentially alternates between\r\nthree stories\u2014the story of Snowden\u2019s discovery of his government\u2019s\r\nhighly intrusive and global surveillance; the story of Snowden\u2019s romance with\r\nLindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley) and how it was impacted by his top-secret jobs;\r\nand the story of the release of what Snowden knew, as documented in \u201cCitizenfour.\u201d\r\nAll three arcs have that \u201cJFK\u201d-esque tendency to have even the smallest roles\r\nfilled by recognizable faces: Rhys Ifans, Tom Wilkinson, Nicolas Cage, Timothy\r\nOlyphant, Joely Richardson, Logan Marshall-Green, Keith Stanfield, Ben Chaplin and more pop up throughout the complex story. And this story is truly complex, especially in the way Stone\r\nand Fitzgerald have chosen to tackle it. They offer a little bit of \u201cthe early days\r\nof Edward,\u201d but it\u2019s not long before Snowden is, shall we say, seeing how the\r\nsausage gets made. For those viewers who have not seen \u201cCitizenfour\u201d or read\r\nmany of the articles written about Snowden, the mid-section of Stone\u2019s\r\nfilm could prove incredibly shocking, and may force a trend of people putting\r\npieces of tape over their laptop camera. That covert operations run by our\r\ngovernment have the capability to turn on your laptop camera without you\r\nknowing it is only one of the revelations here. And as Snowden continues to get\r\ndeeper into the rabbit hole of privacy invasion, Gordon-Levitt\u2019s performance\r\nbecomes more exceptional. At first, it feels like something of an impression\r\n(although a really good one, for the record), but the film works in the way that Gordon-Levitt captures the conflicted inner turmoil of Snowden as the story progresses. He has a remarkable ability to do what so many other actors can\u2019t:\r\nlook at a computer screen and take in its information as if he\u2019s seeing\r\nit for the first time. He grounds a complex story by giving it a very human,\r\nreactive element at its center. Advertisement Stone's film falters with the relationship\r\ndrama involving Snowden and Shailene Woodley's Lindsay Mills. Both actors do their best to make these scenes connect, but\r\nsome moments feel like they came out of another movie and the pair doesn't quite have the right chemistry to make them effective. I understand the\r\nintention\u2014to balance the inordinate number of sequences in front of computer\r\nscreens with a flesh and blood dynamic\u2014but they just don't work, partially due to\r\nflat dialogue but also because they don\u2019t have the energy of the rest of the\r\nfilm. They almost feel like an obligation\u2014a producer\u2019s note to make the film more relatable\u2014but it creates a herky-jerky pace to \u201cSnowden\u201d that keeps it\r\nfrom building steam. I\u2019m sure there were dozens of drafts exploring\r\ndifferent ways to tackle this story, and I'm not convinced they found precisely the\r\nright one. Less relationship drama, and perhaps going chronological from front to back\r\ninstead of using flashback structure, might have helped the rhythm. Despite my issues with the structure of \u201cSnowden,\u201d there are numerous accomplished scenes and the film is carried throughout by\r\nGordon-Levitt. It\u2019s in his body language, which captures a man truly\r\nconflicted about what to do with the information he\u2019s discovered. And that\u2019s an\r\ninteresting approach to the Snowden story in and of itself. In the days\r\nafter the whistleblowing, and even today, many people still want to villainize Snowden as a traitor. It\u2019s not surprising that Stone doesn\u2019t feel\r\nthat way, but what I like about the film is how deeply he works to humanize\r\nsomeone who has become a symbol for US privacy invasion and the need for\r\ntransparency. Working with a very identifiable actor, Stone is careful\r\nto keep this story specific. To be honest, that\u2019s been a gift of his for years,\r\nmaking sure he doesn\u2019t lose the human story of people like Ron Kovic or Jim Garrison\r\nas he\u2019s simultaneously painting a bigger picture. It\u2019s good to have him back at\r\nthe canvas.", "Critic": "Beta"}
