{"Title": "Valley of Love", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert first appeared\r\nonscreen together in 1974\u2019s \u201cGoing Places,\u201d a still-coruscating, anti-buddy sex\r\ncomedy directed by the currently out-of-favor-in-cinephile-land director Bertrand Blier.\r\nHuppert played Jacqueline, a rebellious teen who loses her virginity under\r\nproblematic circumstances to the two louts played by Depardieu and Patrick\r\nDewaere. Isabelle and Gerard were then the romantic leads in\r\nMaurice Pialat\u2019s 1980 \u201cLoulou,\u201d in which Huppert played a young woman who flips\r\noff her nasty abusive husband and her bourgeois social set to pursue erotic\r\nrapture with Depardieu\u2019s titular hunk (who exudes a Joe-Dallesandro-gone-Gallic\r\nallure). That movie was a kind of erotic landmark of ostensibly mainstream\r\nmoviemaking, in part because of Huppert and Depardieu\u2019s candor and lack of\r\ninhibition. The performers continue to exhibit those qualities forty years\r\nafter the fact, reuniting in the evocative, sometimes puzzling, and sometimes\r\nmoving \u201cValley of Love.\u201d Advertisement This is the latest film from Guillaume Nicloux, who recently\r\nmade \u201cThe Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq,\u201d in which the French literary former\r\nenfant terrible played himself in a fictional scenario. Initially, \u201cValley of\r\nLove\u201d also seems occupied with meta activities; the lead actors play characters\r\nnamed \u201cG\u00e9rard\u201d and \u201cIsabelle.\u201d But\u2014and it\u2019s a substantial \"but\"\u2014their characters\r\nare a former married couple, one with an adult son that committed suicide.\r\nThat\u2019s not true of Huppert and Depardieu, despite the fact that their\r\ncharacters, meeting in the USA's own Death Valley after years of\r\nestrangement, are also film performers. Depardieu\u2019s jape of honoring a pesky\r\nAmerican\u2019s autograph request by signing \u201cBob De Niro\u201d leads to some interesting\r\ndiscomfort for him. Obviously, Nicloux got these performers back together to\r\nextrapolate on, or perhaps exploit, their iconography, but he\u2019s up to quite a\r\nbit more than that.  The dead son has, in separate but very nearly verbatim\r\nletters, asked G\u00e9rard and Isabelle to meet for seven days at Death Valley\u2019s\r\npark; at the end of their stay, he promises, he will appear to them. G\u00e9rard has\r\nacquiesced reluctantly; he\u2019s got health issues weighing on his mind. (While\r\nHuppert, now over 60, still looks sensational, the sight of the gargantuan\r\nDepardieu with his shirt off, suntan or not, somehow brings to mind Fredric\r\nForrest\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d monologue about the boiled sides of beef.) Isabelle\r\nbelieves that the manifestation will occur, and implores Gerard to stay and\r\nhave faith. And that\u2019s the film\u2019s operating mechanism; the rest of \u201cValley of\r\nLove\u201d consists of the performers/characters\u2019 sometimes pained, sometimes wryly\r\nfunny interactions. Both G\u00e9rard and Isabelle deal with forms of individual\r\nanxiety (this being a European art film, the scene in which one of them vomits\r\nfeels a little pro forma), and Nicloux throws in more intimations of the\r\nsupernatural as the promised day draws closer. The Death Valley vistas are\r\noften spectacular, the melancholic, dissonant music of Charles Ives is aptly\r\nused, and Depardieu and Huppert resonate mightily even when they\u2019re not up to\r\nmuch. It\u2019s a little jarring to see these two one-time emblems of rebellion in\r\nthe roles of aged parents who just didn\u2019t understand, but of course that\u2019s part\r\nof the film\u2019s point. Youthful impudence is a great and sometimes useful thing,\r\nbut it is, alas, practically unsustainable, which is something we never quite\r\nget while we\u2019re exercising it. These characters, and the actors playing them,\r\nget it very, very well. It\u2019s in the way that Depardieu and Huppert can convey\r\nan aspect of phenomenological rue that gives this sometimes muddled movie its\r\nultimate value.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
