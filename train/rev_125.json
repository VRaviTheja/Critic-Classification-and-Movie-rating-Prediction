{"Title": "Life's a Breeze", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Lance Daly\u2019s \u201cLife\u2019s a Breeze\u201d is as amiable and windswept\r\nas its title promises, for better or worse. One wishes it gusted a bit more\r\noften, but the always-great Fionnula Flanagan and truly charming newcomer Kelly\r\nThornton nearly justify the film\u2019s more sitcomish, hackneyed scenes. Nearly.\r\nHaving adored Daly\u2019s wonderful coming-of-age-meets-fairy-tale film \u201cKisses,\u201d I\r\nwas hoping for a bit more of that magic in \u201cBreeze,\u201d and, other than the\r\naforementioned two performances, one has to dig through too many false, forced\r\ncomedy beats to find them here. Advertisement Nan (Flanagan) is a good old-fashioned Irish hoarder. The Dublin\r\nresident has never been much trouble to her neighbors and generally keeps to\r\nherself. Her unemployed son Colm (Pat Shortt) joins forces with his other\r\nfamily members to give Nan a gift she could never give herself\u2014a clean house.\r\nNiece Emma (Thornton) takes Nan out for the day, and they return to a spotless\r\nhome. Old Chinese takeout menus, newspapers, broken kitchen appliances and an\r\noutdated TV: all gone. So is the old mattress Nan has been sleeping on for\r\ndecades. And shoving her money in because she doesn\u2019t trust the banks. That\u2019s\r\nright: there\u2019s a million Euros in a mattress now winding its way through the\r\nDublin recycling system. A wacky journey to find it ensues. Sort of. While \u201cLife\u2019s a Breeze\u201d has an undeniably sitcomish\r\npresence, it\u2019s almost as if the realist in Daly refuses to embrace the\r\npotentially wacky set-up. And so we\u2019re stuck with a film somewhere in the\r\nmiddle. It's not as offensively slapstick-y as it could have been but it's not realism either. It's caught in the boring center of those two ends of the spectrum. To be fair, character beats between Flanagan and Thornton, particularly in the\r\nfinal act, are truly effective. Flanagan has always been a performer who can do\r\na lot with very little, and Thornton has the kind of natural screen presence\r\nthat announces someone on the film scene. She\u2019s the one performer here who\r\ntruly feels in the moment; at least partially because it feels like she\u2019s the\r\none character Daly truly likes. Daly\u2019s skill with slice of life connects in the scenes between\r\nNan and Emma, and they nearly justify the piece in just a few truthful glances. These are two\r\ninteresting characters brought to life by intriguing actresses. Too bad there\r\nisn\u2019t anything in \u201cLife\u2019s a Breeze\u201d to support them.
