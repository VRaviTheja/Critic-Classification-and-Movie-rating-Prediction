{"Title": "Coldwater", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "What happens when a society built on violent, dictatorial\r\npower faces collapse? How do we deal with violent youths whom we cannot\r\ncontrol? How much freedom should we give those who we allow to shape our\r\nchildren from boys to men? Vincent Grashaw\u2019s SXSW drama \u201cColdwater\u201d tries to deal\r\nwith these challenging questions in the form of a narrative about a juvenile\r\nboot camp, the kind of place that thinks violence and Army training techniques\r\nare the way to deal with teens whose parents no longer have the answers. It\u2019s a\r\npromising topic for a drama, and Grashaw\u2019s talented leading man carries it\r\nuntil the filmmaker steals it from him and destroys everything built up in the\r\nfirst hour. The final act of \u201cColdwater\u201d is horrendously misguided, the kind of\r\ninsincere melodrama that erases the memory of what came before. It\u2019s a\r\nparticular shame because there\u2019s an hour of decent filmmaking here. Advertisement The title refers to a remote location at which parents\r\nessentially give up the protective rights to their children and allow alpha\r\nmales to form them into \u201cbetter citizens.\u201d These places exist, and, as the end\r\ncredits inform us, do so with little governmental oversight, leading to\r\ninjuries and even death. When your son has reached a point where bad behavior\r\nbecomes violent and illegal, what do you do to keep him out of jail? It\u2019s a\r\nserious question facing hundreds of families.  Grashaw clearly believes that places like Coldwater are not\r\nthe answer. From the minute that Brad (P.J. Boudousqu\u00e9) gets there, Coldwater\r\nis painted as a testosterone-heavy corner of Hell. The teens are forced to run\r\nmiles every day, given little water along the way, and that\u2019s the highlight for\r\nmany of them. Sprayed with fire hoses, strung up by their wrists and left\r\novernight, etc.\u2014Colonel Frank (James C. Burns) seems to honestly believe that\r\nhis reform structure will turn boys to men but it\u2019s a harrowing process to do\r\nso. And, perhaps worst of all, Frank has a system in which the \u201cgood kids\u201d\r\nbecome Trustys and eventually employees of Coldwater, which naturally\r\nencourages in-fighting among the barracks. When a friend of Brad\u2019s named Jonas (the naturally talented Octavius\r\nJ. Johnson) gets hit by a counselor-driven ATV on a run, Coldwater starts to\r\nfall apart. The incident brings in some authority figures and Colonel Frank\r\nbegins to sense that his days may be numbered. What happens when a mad man\r\nstarts to lose his control? You can imagine that it gets worse before it gets\r\nbetter. And when one of Brad\u2019s old buddies (Chris Petrovski) comes to\r\nColdwater, it\u2019s the match hitting a lake of gasoline. The majority of what works about \u201cColdwater\u201d for its first\r\nhour can be laid at the feet of Boudousqu\u00e9, who looks like a young Ryan Gosling\r\nand has a bit of that actor\u2019s remarkable internal gravity. The actor is allowed\r\nto essentially play multiple iterations of Brad, as we see flashbacks to what\r\ngot the young man to Coldwater in the first place, watch the struggle of his\r\nearly days, and end with a character who seems broken to the degree that one\r\ncould argue the Colonel\u2019s strategy worked. He\u2019s a shell of a man by the middle\r\nof the film, but he\u2019s more of a man than a rebellious teen. There\u2019s a daring\r\nfilm there\u2014the idea that these facilities are breaking troubled teens down to\r\nthe point that they may be more \u201cmature\u201d but they\u2019ve lost their identities in the\r\nprocess. Advertisement \u201cColdwater\u201d is one of those films that we know can\u2019t\r\npossibly end well, and yet the final act feels unearned and manipulative. The\r\nsubtlety of the performances in the first two acts are discarded for explosions\r\nof violence and surprisingly tidy resolutions. Grashaw offers a climax in the\r\ntraditional sense of the word in that the film almost becomes an action movie,\r\nand strains credulity by taking that route. Instead of the character drama, \u201cColdwater\u201d\r\nbecomes something designed to provoke and thrill in the final act when it\r\nshould be finding the sad truth of troubled youths and people who abuse the\r\npositions of power granted them. It\u2019s as if Grashaw couldn\u2019t stomach the\r\nthought that these kind of nightmarish situations often don\u2019t have the closure\r\nthat filmmaking can provide. And, even though it makes for a disappointing\r\nfilm, who can really blame him?", "Critic": "Beta"}
