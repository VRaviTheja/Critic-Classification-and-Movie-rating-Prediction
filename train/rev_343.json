{"Title": "Calvary", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The second feature written and directed by the prodigiously\r\ntalented Irishman John Michael McDonagh opens with a quote from Saint\r\nAugustine: \u201cDespair not, one of the thieves was spared; presume not, one of the\r\nthieves was not.\u201d (It is no accident that this bit of wisdom is cited in\r\n\u201cWaiting For Godot,\u201d an obscure theatrical work by another talented Irishman\r\nname of Beckett.) Later in the movie, Fiona (Kelly Reilly) the daughter of\r\nCounty Sligo priest James Lavelle (Brendan Gleeson)\u2014Lavelle took the vows after\r\nhis wife, Fiona\u2019s mother, died years earlier\u2014takes confession with her literal\r\nand spiritual father, and, obliquely addressing the troubles that informed her\r\nrecent, half-hearted suicide attempt, asserts, \u201cI belong to myself, not to\r\nanyone else.\u201d To which Father James responds, \u201cTrue. False.\u201d  Advertisement A mordant sense of duality that eventually takes on\r\nnear-apocalyptic dimensions runs through this very darkly comic tale, telling a\r\nweek in the life of Father James. Sunday kicks off pretty horribly. A man\r\nostensibly offering Father James his confession explicitly describes his sexual\r\nabuse at the hands of the priest years earlier, and outline his plan for\r\nrevenge: he intends to kill a \u201cgood priest\u201d in exactly a week. He means for\r\nthat good priest to be Father James, and invites him to a beach spot to meet\r\nhis doom. This disturbs James, as well it might. But he does not go to\r\nthe authorities. Instead, he tends to his flock, such as it is. And a more\r\nperverse bunch would be hard to find anywhere else than in a provincial, lonely\r\nIrish remote. There\u2019s the local butcher (Chris O\u2019Dowd), who might well be\r\nslapping around his sexpot wife (Oria O\u2019Rourke), who\u2019s brazenly conducting an\r\naffair with an African immigrant auto mechanic (Isaach de Bankole). The local\r\nbarkeep\u2019s a ball of resentment, the town\u2019s most dapper young man is completely\r\nsocially inept, the police chief\u2019s a glib sourpuss who makes no attempt to\r\ndisguise the fact that he does business with a manic,\r\nJimmy-Cagney-impersonating male prostitute. The local hospital biggie is a\r\nmonstrously cynical atheist with a monstrous anecdote to explain his poor\r\nattitude. The local fat cat is swilling in his ale, and worse, at his manse\r\nafter being abandoned by his wife and child. And so on. It is again no accident\r\nthat the only characters who are at all kind to Father James, besides his\r\ndaughter, are non-Irish ones: a very aged American ex-pat author (M. Emmett\r\nWalsh, whose presence is extremely welcome despite his looking like death\r\nwarmed over, which admittedly works for the character), determined to off\r\nhimself before he goes completely decrepit, and a French widow (Marie Jos\u00e9e Croze)\r\nwho commiserates with Father James after he performs last rites on her husband. McDonagh\u2019s structuring is unusual: almost all the\r\nscenes are what are referred to in the theater as \u201ctwo handers,\u201d that is,\r\nexchanges between only two characters. Each scene tackles a particular\r\nvariation on the movie\u2019s theme, which is the earning of forgiveness, and\r\nwhether taking what\u2019s said to be the right action is sufficient to do so.\r\nGleeson\u2019s performance is magnificent; sharp, compassionate, bemused, never not\r\nintellectually active. McDonagh\u2019s dialogue is similarly never not sharp, and\r\nonly occasionally lost to an actor\u2019s Irish accent. As the picture progresses,\r\nFather James\u2019 parishioners morph from a group of perverse individuals to one of\r\nintransigently spiteful lunatics. McDonagh takes considerable risks, in this\r\nday and age, crafting what\u2019s essentially an absurdist allegory. By the film\u2019s\r\nfinale, this viewer felt that one or two of the risks didn\u2019t entirely pay off,\r\nbut my admiration for McDonagh\u2019s brass remained intact. This is the kind of\r\nmovie that galvanizes and discomfits while it\u2019s on screen, and is terrific\r\nfodder for conversation long after its credits roll. Even if you are neither\r\nCatholic nor Irish, this \u201cCalvary\u201d will in no way be a useless sacrifice of your moviegoing time. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
