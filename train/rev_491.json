{"Title": "USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "The story of the USS Indianapolis is one of the most harrowing in United States history. The Navy ship, a heavy cruiser, was tasked with a top-secret mission in the last days of World War II, delivering components for the A-bomb that would be dropped on Hiroshima, helping to end that war. (It was simply impossible for a plane carrying that bomb to fly from the United States to Japan.) After making the delivery to Guam, the ship took off, once again under a cloak of secrecy. But it was sunk by a Japanese sub and about a quarter of its men went down with the ship. About 900 other sailors clung to life rafts with scant supplies awaiting a rescue that was probably never going to come, given the nature of their mission. During the four-day interval before their discovery, the men were beset by sharks. (The character of Quint in \u201cJaws,\u201d played by Robert Shaw, tells its story therein.) 317 survived. Things weren\u2019t subsequently very rosy for one of the survivors, the ship\u2019s commander, Captain Charles McVay. In what\u2019s today widely seen as an example of internecine Navy scapegoating, McVay was court-martialed and convicted of hazarding his ship. He was posthumously exonerated by President Clinton in 2000.  Advertisement You\u2019d think, maybe, that they\u2019d have made a movie about this event a long time ago. But if you thought harder immediately thereafter, you\u2019d understand why they didn\u2019t. Not only is the story in its particulars mind-blowingly grisly, it\u2019s not one to which a filmmaker can easily apply an inspirational message. There\u2019s also the logistical difficulty of depicting men floating in the ocean and fending off shark attacks for several days. As it happens, there was a made-for-television movie made about the events for CBS, \u201cMission of the Shark,\u201d and network standards and practices ensured that it didn\u2019t even try to depict the events accurately. In the hands of filmmakers with the will and means to contrive a realistic simulation of events, the results would be unwatchable. The movie \u201cUSS Indianapolis: Men of Courage\u201d is not exactly unwatchable, but it\u2019s also completely not worthy of watching. The movie begins with Japanese planes having at the Indianapolis, and the scene looks like a video game, and not a particularly good one either. Into this shameless fakery steps, goodness gracious, Nicolas Cage, in his 648th starring role of 2016, as Captain McVay, who at one point looks into the camera and intones \u201cThere will always be war until we kill ourselves off as a species.\u201d He\u2019s talking, as it happens, to a framed photo of his wife, to whom he\u2019s writing a letter, but it\u2019s still disconcerting. There\u2019s a lot of disconcerting in the movie\u2019s opening scenes. Navy brass concocting the mission in Washington D.C. are shown as very contemporary clich\u00e9 villains; they all talk like ceegar-chomping variations of Larry The Cable Guy as they discuss their strategy to end the war. To paraphrase Waylon Jennings, are you sure Harry Truman done it this way? I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 Continuing the lazy inattention to period detail, we are soon treated to the sight of a burlesque dancer with obvious breast implants entertaining our boys. One sailor makes reference to \u201clean, mean, fighting machines.\u201d Okay. Some of the young Navy men are given quirky character traits\u2014one is keeping a poetic journal of his observations, such as \u201cThe streets are alive \u2026 and the sailors \u2026 are on the prowl to night!\u201d There are others who have their extremely particular at-home dilemmas to solve once they return from the war, as for instance a romantic triangle half-filched from \u201cLove Actually\u201d featuring Cody Walker, Adam Scott Miller and Emily Tennant. There is some depiction of racial tensions between the sailors, and this is commendable in theory, but not in practice. So much of the dialogue is so bad, and the situations so hackneyed, that the question of \u201cWhat would a World War II movie written by Tommy Wiseau sound like?\u201d in case you\u2019ve ever asked it, is herein answered. (The script is actually by Cam Cannon and Richard Rionda Del Castro, who\u2019ve worked with Cage before on 2014\u2019s \u201cRage.\u201d) And in case you\u2019re wondering why the scenarists went to so much trouble with these storylines, it\u2019s merely so they could play shark roulette with the characters when the ship goes down. The \u201cand then some of them got run over by a truck, only in this case a grey dead-eyed truck with sharp teeth\u201d approach is crass enough that one wonders just where the idea that this movie was honoring he sacrifice of the real-life Indianapolis sailors could possibly have come from.  Advertisement The movie is directed by Mario Van Peebles, who\u2019s been behind the camera for some at-least-engaging pictures in the past. It would be a bad play on words to say that he\u2019s out of his depth here, so let\u2019s just aver that his reach here definitively exceeds his grasp. As formidably, teeth-grindingly bad as much of the movie is, near the end there\u2019s a scene that\u2019s almost affecting, one in which Cage\u2019s McVay has a quiet, pained conversation with the Japanese sub commander who sank his ship, played by Yutaka Takeuchi. Two minutes of sincerity don\u2019t make up for two-hours plus of bumbling and pandering, though.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
