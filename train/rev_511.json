{"Title": "My Old Lady", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "For the first forty minutes or so, \u201cMy Old Lady,\u201d the film directorial debut of respected playwright Israel Horowitz, adapting his own play, is a \u201cno problem\u201d proposition. That is to say, because Horowitz is a respected playwright for good reason (his 1960s two-hander \u201cThe Indian Wants The Bronx\u201d is, I suspect, still a staple for acting workshops and small theater companies to this day), the writing\u2019s no problem. And because the cast is topped by Kevin Kline, Maggie Smith, and Kristen Scott-Thomas, the acting is no problem. And because the movie is set in Paris, specifically the extremely-suffused-with-conventional-Gallic-charm Marais section of the city, the views are no problem.\u00a0 Advertisement The storyline hinges on a peculiarity of French real estate sales. The movie begins with Kline\u2019s character, a put-upon aging American named Mathias (although he prefers a more casual mode of nomenclature, for reasons that become clear over time), coming into Paris full of hope and excitement: his late father, while denying his considerable fortune to his son, has willed him an apartment in Paris. Heretofore penniless and with no prospects\u2014the guy\u2019s got lots of problems\u2014his scheme to sell the apartment for a tidy sum and slough off for the rest of his days hits a snag right away: there\u2019s an old woman living in the place, and she has no intention of leaving. Indeed, she is not even required to leave. That\u2019s where the peculiarity in French real estate comes in. The apartment, which could fetch millions of Euros for Mathias, is a \u201cviager.\u201d The old woman, Mathilde (Smith), an Englishwoman long based in France, was the apartment\u2019s prior owner; the new \u201cowner\u201d can buy the place for a song, pay the prior owner a monthly fee, and inherit the place free and clear once the inhabitant dies. The desperate Mathias immediately starts calculating the likely date of Mathilde\u2019s death, while Mathilde snootily looks down her nose at failure-in-life Mathias. \u201cI\u2019m 90,\u201d she admits early on. \u201cSubtlety is not something that interests me.\u201d Turns out, according to her super-irritated live-in daughter Chloe (Scott-Thomas), she\u2019s 92, but what\u2019s a couple of years between antagonists. The antagonism, of course, has layers, and it doesn\u2019t take a lot of effort to guess that Mathilde is not just someone with whom Mathias\u2019 dad had a business arrangement. These developments turn \u201cMy Old Lady\u201d from a comedy of manners and errors into a domestic drama of not inconsiderable depth.\u00a0 Despite a certain number of plausibility-stretching plot points, particularly concerning the likely motivations of the ever-offstage dead father, and also in spite of an over-busy music score by Paul Mehling, \u201cMy Old Lady\u201d is pretty compelling viewing, mostly thanks to Kline, who gives a career-high performance here. The lithe actor has spent much of his film career being pretty bright and breezy, and here he starts from a point of glib confidence that crumbles into bluff pretty quickly, and goes to darker places than he\u2019s depicted in recent memory. It\u2019s a revelation and a pleasure. In a way, Smith has the more difficult role: her character\u2019s back story should have yielded a more hateful figure, but Mathilde can\u2019t be hateful or the whole mechanism would fall apart. On the other hand, Smith has ever seemed capable of vaulting such performing challenges in her sleep, and she does so here. The 75-year-old Horovitz does nothing to redefine cinema language with his first film, but he doesn\u2019t aim to; rather, he keeps a steady hand on his story\u2019s tiller, says what he wants to say, weakens his resolve and delivers an ever-so-slightly pat denouement, and gets out. People who complain about the absence of genuine adult drama from cinema screens have an opportunity to put their monies where their mouths are here.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
