{"Title": "Seventh Son", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cHope for the best, expect the worst.\u201d Mel Brooks\r\npopularized that adage in a funny song he co-wrote for one of his most amusing\r\nfilms, the relatively obscure 1970 \u201cThe Twelve Chairs.\u201d It\u2019s a useful sentiment\r\nin general, but, for the film reviewer, something that applies most particularly\r\nin the first two months of the new year, which, at least as far as studio\r\nproduct is concerned, represent a dumping ground for problematic product or\r\njust plain unmarketable dreck.  Given the fact that its U.S. release date was moved not\r\nonce, but twice, and that it now finds itself occupying a date in the\r\naforementioned dumping ground, one might expect the Sergei-Bodrov-directed\r\n\u201cSeventh Son,\u201d a medieval fantasy tale with a strong Young Adult stress in its\r\nplotting (not surprising, as it\u2019s based on a YA book, the first of three so far\r\nfeaturing the same characters, as is the thing these days) to be pretty bad.\r\nBut, surprise! One doesn\u2019t want to damn the movie with faint praise by saying\r\n\u201cit\u2019s not that bad,\u201d but that\u2019s kind of the most objectively accurate\r\ndescription of it, in all honesty. Subjectively, though? This critic, who\u2019s an\r\nunabashed fan of the myth-mash-up monster movies of the \u201850s and \u201860s that\r\nfeatured a plethora of stop-motion-animated monsters and such, found himself\r\nrather enjoying more than a few portions of the movie, which indeed features a\r\nplethora of computer-animated monsters that at least seem to have been inspired\r\nby the work of such old-school tech masters as Ray Harryhausen.  Advertisement Another attraction is that the adult leads of the picture\r\nare Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore. Bridges plays a righteous witch-hunting\r\n\u201cspook\u201d (he\u2019s also a Knight of some secret sacred order or another) while\r\nMoore plays a near-omnipotent witch who\u2019s going to use the\r\nonce-in-a-hundred-years \u201cnight of the blood moon\u201d to make herself 100%\r\nomnipotent. Of course these two characters have a romantic back-story. Of\r\ncourse they do. Since every other film critic writing about this movie is going\r\nto make some kind of \u201cI didn\u2019t think the sequel to \u2018Big Lebowski\u2019 would be THIS\r\nweird\u201d joke, I\u2019ll spare you my effort. It is, however, a pleasure to see The\r\nDude and Maude in a clinch once more, even if Bridges\u2019 mumble-mouthed, grizzled\r\nhero is more like his \u201cTrue Grit\u201d Rooster Coburn crossed with Richard Harris in\r\n\u201cCamelot,\u201d had Richard Harris been 70 in \u201cCamelot.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s a truly\r\neccentric performance, and why not. As for Moore, she looks gorgeous and\r\nslithers with enough menace that you can almost convince yourself that her\r\ndragon-morph isn't a special effect.  The YA aspect is provided by the spook\u2019s new apprentice, the\r\ntitular seventh son Tom Ward (Ben Barnes), who, of course, falls for a teen witch\r\n(half-witch, more accurately; the condition of half-witchdom plays a crucial\r\nalbeit entirely predictable part in the plot) who\u2019s the daughter of Moore\u2019s\r\nright-hand witch. The standard complications ensue, but they\u2019re pretty easy to\r\ngloss over if you just wanna get off on the fellas battling man-bears and\r\nmulti-armed swordsman and a bald-pated guy who can make ax-blades out of his\r\nhands when he\u2019s NOT being a dragon. At such points, and particularly during a\r\ncliff-diving-and-waterfall scene in which Tom goes up against a very stubborn\r\ngiant, \u201cSeventh Son\u201d builds up the goofy charm of an old-school Saturday\r\nafternoon matinee. The tech credits, as they call them in the trades, tell you\r\nwhy: the effects were designed by original \u201cStar Wars\u201d guy John Dykstra, and\r\nthe sumptuous art direction is by Dante Ferretti, who\u2019s worked magic for the\r\nlikes of Fellini, De Palma, and Scorsese. Olivia Williams and Djimon Hounsou\r\nare welcome components in the supporting cast, and the whole thing is over and\r\ndone with in a good deal less than two hours. A towering cinematic achievement?\r\nHardly. But not entirely unsatisfying if this particular genre itch needs some\r\nscratching.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
