{"Title": "Intruders", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cIntruders,\u201d once called \u201cShut In\u201d on the fest circuit, is\r\nan effective home invasion thriller with interesting performances and tight\r\npacing \u2026 until it\u2019s not. Like so many genre films, \u201cIntruders\u201d can\u2019t quite figure\r\nout its final act, and this one devolves from a thrilling predator-and-prey\r\ngame into something closer to \u201cSaw.\u201d Director Adam Schindler is better with\r\nactors than a lot of young horror directors\u2014resulting in the tightness of that\r\nfirst half\u2014but can\u2019t quite get a handle on where the movie needs to go from\r\nthere. The result is a promising film that leaves a bad taste in your mouth,\r\nlike a meal well-presented on the plate that just doesn\u2019t fill you up. Advertisement Anna (Beth Riesgraf) is an agoraphobic young woman who hasn\u2019t\r\nleft the family house in a decade. Her brother Conrad (Timothy T. McKinney) is\r\nher only companion, but he\u2019s dying in the film\u2019s opening scenes. A nice Meals\r\non Wheels guy (Rory Culkin) is one of Anna\u2019s few connections to the outside\r\nworld. These opening scenes define Anna\u2019s world well, and Riesgraf is very good\r\nin them, conveying someone who\u2019s actually more scared of going out her front\r\ndoor than anything that might come through it. After her brother\u2019s passing,\r\nRiesgraf deftly conveys Anna\u2019s crippling fear, agoraphobia so bad that it keeps\r\nher from even going to the funeral. And that\u2019s when the problems start. Three guys (Jack Kesy,\r\nJoshua Mikel and Martin Starr) who presumed that Anna would be out of the house\r\nbreak into it to rob the place. Anna is still home, dressed up for the funeral\r\nbut unable to will herself to go. At first, it looks like \u201cIntruders\u201d may play\r\nout like \u201cPanic Room,\u201d as the home invaders realize that someone has altered\r\ntheir plans. However, it\u2019s not long before the tables are turned, leaving the\r\nmen in a basement that\u2019s, well, not your average lower floor. It turns out that\r\nAnna has a dark family history and the men who thought they could steal her\r\nfamily fortune are about to confront it. While the three criminals who bust through Anna\u2019s front door\r\nare relatively and predictably defined\u2014one killer, one peaceful guy, one leader\u2014the\r\ncast and setting sell the action. We believe Anna is so crippled by fear that\r\nher captors don\u2019t even think they have to tie her up to stop her from escaping.\r\nThe filmmaking in this first act is lean and tight, ably propelled by Riesgraf\r\nand the always-great Starr, playing against type here as the maniac who wants to\r\nplunge a hammer into Anna\u2019s head. I could do without the shaky camerawork to\r\ncapture Anna\u2019s fear (the actress is good enough that the trick is unnecessary),\r\nbut I was down with \u201cIntruders\u201d until a major incident at the 30-minute mark\r\ncompletely changes the stakes and dynamic. Advertisement Even then, \u201cIntruders\u201d doesn\u2019t completely fall apart. It\r\njust gets repetitive and even ugly. There\u2019s a lot of use of the word \u201cbitch\u201d\r\nand close-ups of violence. As the piece becomes more \u201cSaw\u201d than \u201cPanic Room,\u201d\r\nthe characters disappear and we\u2019re left with too little to hold on to.\r\nSchindler can\u2019t handle the gore effectively, as scenes like the one in which\r\nblood pours onto Anna\u2019s face just feel gross. It doesn\u2019t need to be that ugly\r\nof a film. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t mind gore at all. It just has to feel\r\npurposeful, and it doesn\u2019t here. And then the final 15 minutes are of the \u201cthat\r\nonly happens in a horror movie\u201d variety, revealing that the psychological\r\nelements of the piece have always been mere window-dressing. People are not so easily defined as we\u2019ve been led to\r\nbelieve. Just because Anna is a shut-in doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s weak. And just because\r\nher home invaders are hammer-wielding tough guys doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t turn\r\nthe tables on them. That\u2019s the aspect of \u201cIntruders\u201d that works, and the\r\nfoundation on which the rest of the film should have been built instead of\r\ninconsistent characters and shock value. You could do a lot worse for a horror\r\nVOD rental this weekend (or even a trip to the theater if it\u2019s near you given\r\nthe abysmal January competition), but you still won\u2019t shake the feeling that \u201cIntruders\u201d\r\nshould have been a lot better.", "Critic": "Beta"}
