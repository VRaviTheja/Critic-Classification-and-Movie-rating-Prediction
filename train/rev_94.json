{"Title": "Extraordinary Tales", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda\u2019s \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d is an animated anthology\r\nfilm of Edgar Allan Poe stories narrated by luminaries like Christopher Lee,\r\nGuillermo Del Toro and even Bela Lugosi himself (using old audio footage). To\r\nbe blunt, it\u2019s kind of difficult to mess that up too much. Christopher Lee\r\nreading Edgar Allan Poe? Sign me up. Both the source material and the man\r\nreading it are legendary. And that inherent cool factor in \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d\r\ncarries the final product a very long way, although its shortcomings do\r\nsometimes force me to wonder if it could have been a masterpiece instead of a\r\nmere curiosity. As is, a few decisions made by Garc\u00eda in the filmmaking process\r\nhold \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d back from its true potential, although if it\r\nintroduces filmgoers to the works of Poe (or Lee or Lugosi, for that matter),\r\nit\u2019s done some good. Advertisement Garc\u00eda and his team animate each short film in very\r\ndifferent styles, coming back to a wraparound conversation between a raven and\r\na statue in a cemetery between shorts. It starts with the amazing \u201cThe Fall of\r\nthe House of Usher,\u201d read by Christopher Lee. The animation is surprisingly\r\nflat, looking often like a last-generation video game with too much CGI, when\r\nhand-drawn would have given this atmospheric piece more punch. However, it\u2019s\r\neasy to appreciate the budgetary freedom that animation gives Garc\u00eda with \u201cUsher,\" as\r\nthe house falls apart in a way that would have cost a studio $80 million were\r\nit live-action. In many ways, the second short story chosen is Poe\u2019s most\r\npopular and the most interestingly conceived within \u201cExtraordinary Tales.\u201d A\r\nhighly-truncated (they all are, and sometimes frustratingly so) version of \u201cThe\r\nTell-Tale Heart\u201d is told by a scratchy audio of the one-and-only Bela Lugosi,\r\naccompanied by starkly vivid animation in sharp blacks and blinding whites that\u2019s\r\nmeant to invoke famous comic artist Alberto Breccia. As a standalone piece,\r\ndespite the edits to the source, this is a fascinating bit of cinema in that it captures influences from around the world, bringing Lugosi, Poe, and Breccia\r\nunder one twisted tent.  \u201cThe Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\u201d (narrated by Julian\r\nSands), \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum\u201d (narrated by Guillermo Del Toro) and \u201cThe\r\nMasque of Red Death\u201d aren\u2019t as effective, especially the final one, which may\r\nbe the strongest visually but eschews all narration and has almost no dialogue\r\nto tell this tale only with images. I\u2019m not sure taking away the film\u2019s\r\ngreatest asset\u2014Poe\u2019s way with words\u2014was the smartest way to end the piece.  And that\u2019s a feeling I had a few too many times in \u201cExtraordinary\r\nTales\u201d\u2014wondering why Garc\u00eda made a certain visual choice, or why he cut a\r\ncertain part of Poe\u2019s stories while focusing on another (the whole thing only\r\nruns 73 minutes, when it would have benefitted by being twice as long and\r\nletting Poe\u2019s brilliance linger before jumping on to the next piece). Again,\r\nPoe\u2019s storytelling gift is so timeless, and the voice actors assembled so\r\ncaptivating, that \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d can\u2019t help but work on some level. It\r\njust never quite rises above that faint praise. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
