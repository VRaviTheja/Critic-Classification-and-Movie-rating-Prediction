{"Title": "Den of Thieves", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The first thing you should know about this movie is that, yup, it really is two hours and twenty minutes long. A fellow reviewer and I were discussing the timing given by the IMDb and we both thought, no way can this probably relatively dinky cops-and-robbers picture be almost two and a half hours. But it is. \u201cDen of Thieves\u201d opens with some text explaining just how many bank robberies occur in Los Angeles California over the span of one year\u2014broken down by months, days, hours, and minutes. Having rolled out the stats, and they are impressive, the text concludes that \u201cLos Angeles in the bank robbery capital of the world.\u201d Already one feels the movie, co-written and directed by Christian Gudegast, is doing some kind of special pleading. There are four million stories in this naked city, and not all of them can be \u201cHeat,\u201d but this one is KINDA like that, okay? Advertisement Indeed, the movie begins with crime that\u2019s committed like a paramilitary operation. An armored car stops at a donut place and an SUV full of masked men armed to the teeth swoop in on it. A dropped coffee sets off a trigger-happy heist man, and a near-massacre ensues. This crew didn\u2019t want it that way, but as its mastermind, Merriman (Pablo Schreiber) glumly notes when they\u2019ve gotten to safety, \u201cNow we\u2019re cop-killers.\u201d And they did it all for an empty truck.\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the things that Gerard Butler\u2019s \u201cBig\u201d Nick Davis, the major crimes cop on the scene, has to figure out. He runs a half-rogue crew he calls \u201cThe Regulators,\u201d and they\u2019re not above kidnapping and torturing suspected perps to get their men. Butler, sporting a slightly unruly beard, plays the role as if he\u2019s imitating Mel Gibson during his drunk driving arrest. He\u2019s crude, boorish, and cavalier. Genre mavens will see where Gudegast, who wrote Butler\u2019s last film, \u201cLondon Has Fallen\u201d and is making his feature directorial debut here, is pulling his threads from. The Neal/Vincent dynamic of \u201cHeat\u201d isn\u2019t duplicated here; it\u2019s more like the Chance/Masters dynamic in \u201cTo Live And Die In L.A.,\u201d in which cop and criminal dealt in the same kind of corruption but the criminal was ultimately the more ethically pure of the two. Thing is, though, \u201cDen of Thieves\u201d never really gets that deep, and turns out not to be all that terribly serious a movie anyway. The various character dynamics are almost a smokescreen for a convoluted heist targeting the only bank in Los Angeles that has never been robbed: the branch of the Federal Reserve where, among other things, old money is destroyed around the same time as the serial numbers attached to it are erased.\u00a0 The plot thickens ...\u00a0and thickens ...\u00a0and thickens. Gudegast is clearly an avid student of heist pictures, and he layers this one with a lot of spectacular complications even while he muddles the average viewer\u2019s potential rooting interest. As charismatic as Schreiber\u2019s gangleader and the criminal lieutenant played by Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d Jackson can be (Gudegast engineers a scene involving Jackson\u2019s character\u2019s daughter going on a prom date for a comic-relief \u201cdad gives the date a talking to\u201d scene), they\u2019re still guys who blew away almost a dozen cops in the opening scene, so the suspense when they\u2019re finally inside the Fed building and almost pulling things off is potentially slightly compromised. As for Butler\u2019s Nick, yeah, he\u2019s consistently asking for a spanking to say the least. But where Gudegast really shows his hand, if you\u2019re in the mood to stay ahead of this movie, is in the casting. There\u2019s one character, played by an actor of star-quality charisma, who keeps getting put off to the side in the story, and you have to wonder why. Once you\u2019ve decided why, you can figure out at least one of the twists. And of course, the actor, who I won\u2019t name, is winning enough that you suddenly understand exactly where your rooting interest was supposed to have been all along.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
