{"Title": "Two Men in Town", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "This movie is a loose remake of a 1973 French crime drama written and directed by Jose\u00a0Giovanni, who wrote a handful of classic genre pictures, including Jacques Becker\u2019s\u00a0prison-break picture \u201cLe Trou,\u201d Alain Corneau\u2019s gangster-on-the-run story \u201cClasse tous\u00a0risques\u201d (both 1960) and Jean-Pierre Melville\u2019s one-last-caper \u201cLe Deuxieme Souffle\u201d\u00a0(1966). Giovanni\u2019s original was a tense, lean narrative of a paroled con dogged by an\u00a0old enemy, a cop with a grudge. This film, directed by Rachid Bouchareb, best known\u00a0in this country for his \u201cIndig\u00e8nes\u201d (aka \u201cDays of Glory\u201d), about North African soldiers\u00a0fighting for France in World War II, makes the story a bit baggier, and, in a reach for\u00a0contemporary significance, changes its setting to contemporary New Mexico and makes\u00a0its paroled criminal a convert to Islam.\u00a0 Advertisement In this update, the viewer knows things are going to end badly from the opening shots.\u00a0One of the film\u2019s characters is seen dragging an inert body over a desert landscape.\u00a0Then, in a long shot, he\u2019s seen smashing the body\u2019s head with a rock while screaming.\u00a0The perspective reminded me of a similar death-seen-from-a-great distance scene, in Abderrahmane Sissako\u2019s extraordinary 2014 \u201cTimbuktu,\u201d but where Sissako\u2019s scene\u00a0showed a quiet, implacable assurance, Bouchareb\u2019s presentation has a slight ring of\u00a0manipulative dynamics, and overdetermination. This feel persists over the course of\u00a0many perfectly-framed vistas, including a shot of Brenda Blethyn standing in a doorway\u00a0that is practically begging the viewer to compare it to \u201cThe Searchers.\u201d But Blethyn\u2019s\u00a0recognizable presence also constitutes a godsend of sorts: when this film's excellent actors\u00a0are given things to do, Bouchareb\u2019s heavy-handedness is easier to ignore.\u00a0 Blethyn\u2019s character is a parole officer. Forrest Whitaker plays Garnett, out three years\u00a0early from a twenty-year-plus sentence; seems he killed a deputy during his gang-banger\u00a0times. Harvey Keitel is Agati, a humane but exceptionally businesslike sheriff who has an\u00a0extreme grudge against Garnett. The movie takes its time with these characters. Garnett,\u00a0praised early on by his spiritual adviser on having learned to control his anger (there\u2019s\u00a0the first-act gun-mention you always hear that Chekhov quotation pulled out about), rides\u00a0around on a motorbike enjoying his newfound freedom while Agati seethes and ponders\u00a0what he\u2019s going to do about this new problem preying on his mind. Blethyn\u2019s character\u00a0gives Garnett the old tough-not-quite-love treatment, bristling when he ingenuously\u00a0boasts to her about a date with a woman he\u2019s about to go on. \u201cTell her the truth,\u201d she\u00a0bluntly advises him. And he does, eventually. But once Agati starts harassing him, and\u00a0once an old criminal associate (Luis Guzman) starts trying to lure him back into the fold,\u00a0Garnett starts coiling up into himself more and more. An explosion is bound to happen.\u00a0 The suspense is spiced up here by the culture clashes implicit in the environment and\u00a0explicit in some of the characterizations. Early in the film Keitel\u2019s sheriff asks Blethyn\u2019s\u00a0character to stop by a barbecue celebrating the return home of some troops who\u2019ve been\u00a0serving in Afghanistan. Garnett\u2019s devotion to his newfound faith doesn\u2019t impress Agati\u00a0at all: in fact it seems to deepen his resentment of the character. What\u2019s odd about \u201cTwo\u00a0Men\u201d is the fact that after establishing all of this material relative to character, Bouchareb,\u00a0who co-wrote the adaptation with Olivier Lorelle and Yasmina Khadra, allows it to\u00a0all fall away. The story builds to a climactic confrontation, but not the one, perhaps,\u00a0that we\u2019ve been expecting, and then ends on a frustratingly indeterminate note that has\u00a0little to do with the issues the movie went to the trouble to raise in the first place. As\u00a0exceptional as the acting in the picture is, and it is wonderful\u2014Whitaker and Keitel are as\u00a0inventive and surprising as they\u2019ve been in years, and the supporting roles played by the\u00a0likes of Ellen Burstyn and Stan Carp are well-sketched\u2014it can\u2019t entirely lift the movie\u00a0from the rut it has all but plowed into by the end credits.
