{"Title": "Finding Vivian Maier", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "In the opening scenes of Jeff Maloof and Charlie Siskel\u2019s \u201cFinding\r\nVivian Maier,\u201d its titular subject is described as \u201cparadoxical\u201d, \u201cbold\u201d, \u201ceccentric\u201d,\r\nand other words that get at the fact that the men and women who were closest to\r\nMaier in her time on Earth didn\u2019t really know much about her. In 2007, Maloof\r\nwas working on a book about his Chicago neighborhood and longed for the right\r\narchival photography. A flea market junkie from a young age, he took a risk at an auction,\r\nbidding on a box of negatives that he never ended up using and shoved in a\r\ncloset. Two years later, he developed them out of curiosity and discovered a\r\nwoman now considered one of the best photographers of the 20th\r\ncentury. When the best of Maier\u2019s work first appears in the film about her, the\r\nquality takes your breath away and sends chills down your spine. She was a true\r\ntalent. And yet Maloof and Siskel\u2019s film presents an interesting moral quandary along with its profile of an amazing photographer. When does creative ability and the desire to share a true\r\nartist\u2019s eye trump what has to be considered an invasion of privacy? Advertisement The story of \u201cFinding Vivian Maier\u201d progresses from Maloof\u2019s\r\nauction find to his scanning the developed photos into a Flickr account and\r\nrealizing that he wasn\u2019t alone in his assessment of Maier\u2019s talent. And so he\r\nwent after the rest of the story, trying not only to find the rest of the\r\nnegatives but Maier\u2019s back story, and how it impacted her photography.\r\nImmediately, significant questions haunted Maloof. Why did she never show her\r\nwork to anyone? Why did she shoot over 150,000 photos, most of them from a box\r\ncamera that she always carried around her neck and could surreptitiously use to\r\ncapture her subjects? And what\u2019s the point of taking so many photos if no one sees them? When Maloof discovers that Maier recently passed and is\r\nallowed access to her storage unit, a portrait of a hoarder becomes more\r\nclearly defined. She didn\u2019t just take 150,000 photos. She kept receipts for\r\ndecades, collected trinkets, stacked newspapers to the point that her floor sagged.\r\nShe rather quickly goes from \u201ceccentric\u201d to mentally ill, especially when\r\nstories of her relative disregard for many of the children she nannied come\r\ninto focus. (One family speaks about the photos she took when one of her wards\r\nwas hit by a car and the behavior turns to honest mental and physical abuse\r\nlater in life). She often gave fake names and some claim she used a fake\r\naccent. She wanted to be hidden, private, and reclusive. Just because she once\r\nlooked into selling photos doesn\u2019t change the mountain of behavior that\r\nsuggests that she saw her negatives and photos as something else to fill the\r\nstorage unit of memories. And now all of that is being torn down. The argument has\r\nbeen made that Maier\u2019s photos are fair game because she didn\u2019t destroy the\r\nnegatives. She didn\u2019t destroy ANYTHING. She kept receipts buried in trinkets in\r\nenvelopes in boxes. And the film raises the question of privacy regularly with\r\npeople who knew Maier commenting on how much she would have loathed this\r\ninvestigation into her life and Maloof wondering aloud if he\u2019s gone too far.\r\nSadly, the filmmakers brush it off by answering the question with their\r\nfascination with this odd, talented outsider artist. Curiosity is used an\r\nexcuse to invade privacy. Not good enough. If they had taken a strong stance and simply stated\r\nthat art is meant to be shared and displayed no matter the artist\u2019s wishes, I\r\nmight have actually agreed. But the invasive nature of \u201cFinding Vivian Maier\u201d\r\nis only briefly given lip service and never adequately handled (within the film\u2026the\r\ncreators supposedly have dealt with the issue elsewhere but this is a review of what\u2019s in the film\r\nitself and not supplemental material). Advertisement Is it possible to love the art but disagree with the way it\u2019s\r\npresented? Vivian Maier\u2019s photography is absolutely incredible and now that it\u2019s\r\nbeen unearthed and her past has been investigated, her talent should be\r\nappreciated. And so I\u2019m incredibly torn about \u201cFinding Vivian Maier\u201d overall. Should\r\nMaloof and Siskel have opened a door that a dead woman so clearly wanted\r\nlocked? I\u2019d say no (or they should have done so with more authority and\r\nartistic justification instead of just glossing over the issue with \"But isn't she interesting?\"). And yet now that\r\nit\u2019s open, it can\u2019t be closed again. Perhaps when Maloof posted those photos on\r\nFlickr, there was no turning back. And oh is it ever fascinating what is behind that door.", "Critic": "Beta"}
