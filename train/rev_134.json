{"Title": "A Fantastic Fear of Everything", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Jack (Simon Pegg) is a writer. Or, he was. He wrote a popular children's\r\n book about a sensitive hedgehog named Harold. He blames that book for \r\nruining his marriage. When \"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" opens, Jack \r\nis currently working on a project called \"Decades of Death\", a study of \r\nVictorian-era serial killers, the \"Golden Age of murder\". He cannot \r\nleave his flat in Hackney. He sleeps clutching a knife. Jack is afraid \r\nof everything, of being murdered, of launderettes, of eyeballs, of \r\nChristmas carolers, of the telephone ringing, and every other casual \r\nthing that comes up in life.\n\r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\", directed by Crispian Mills (with \r\nanimation sequences directed by Chris Hopewell), is a fascinating and \r\nuneven horror-comedy, strange and ambitious, anchored by a tour de force\r\n performance by Simon Pegg. Pegg, obviously, is well-known to fans of \r\nEdgar Wright's films, as well as his appearances in blockbuster \r\nfranchises like \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Star Trek\", but here, he is \r\nbasically given a one-man show. He is in every scene, clad in filthy \r\nunderpants and an open silk robe. He is a phenomenal physical actor. \r\nWatching him work is the primary pleasure of \"A Fantastic Fear of \r\nEverything.\" Similar to \"Barton Fink,\" another hallucinogenic story of a\r\n writer haunted by his own unfinished projects and lost opportunities, \r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" examines the creative process as seen \r\nthrough the eyes of a writer gone completely mad.\n\r\nJack is a wreck when the film opens, and his condition deteriorates from\r\n there. Fleeing from shadows in his own gloomy flat, it is hard to \r\nbelieve that Jack was ever together enough to have had any success as a \r\nwriter, let alone be someone's husband. \"A Fantastic Fear\" is best when \r\nit explores what it is like inside a paranoid mind, a man so bewildered \r\nby the simple tasks of life (\"I've never bought a toilet roll!\" he cries\r\n in a panic to his agent) that he cannot leave his house.\n\r\nThe first half of the film features Jack gearing up for a lunch with his\r\n agent (deliciously played by Clare Higgins), and then the fallout from \r\nthat meeting, where she tells him a producer from Hollywood is \r\ninterested in his \"Decades of Death\" project. All he needs to do, the \r\nonly thing, is put on a suit and meet the guy for dinner. But once he is\r\n back in his flat, the hallucinations take over again, and he becomes \r\nconvinced that the Hollywood guy is somehow related to one of the grisly\r\n Victorian murderers on his wall. At any rate, the situation goes south,\r\n and his panic is exacerbated by the fact that he does not own a suit, \r\nhis socks are filthy, and he is afraid of going to the laundromat. Mills\r\n and the production design team pull out all the stops in the first \r\nhalf, filming Pegg in a distorted and fantastical way, so that never \r\nonce are we outside his delusional viewpoint. Shadows loom around Jack \r\nand cloaked figures seem to float at the end of the dark hallway. Six \r\ninnocent Christmas carolers on the stoop are filmed as though they are \r\nportents of evil doom. As awful as the situation is for Jack, Pegg is so\r\n funny and so committed to the performance that the psychotic break \r\nbecomes hugely entertaining.\n\r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" goes off the rails in its second half, \r\nwhen Jack ventures out to wash his socks, shirt, and underpants at a \r\nlaundromat. He is so frightened that the fellow customers at the \r\nlaundromat stare at him with what seems to be hostile intent. The \r\nsituation, which starts out humorously (made even more so by the fact \r\nthat Jack has accidentally Super-glued his huge knife to his hand), \r\ndrags on so long it becomes actually interminable. It is as though once \r\nJack leaves his flat, so rich with psychodrama horror-movie potential, \r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" doesn't know what film it wants to be \r\nanymore. There are still some very funny moments, and the script is \r\noften hilarious. Only Simon Pegg could make the screamed comment \"This \r\nis a CELLAR\" funnier with every repetition.\n\r\nAs the film galumphs awkwardly towards its ending, with flashes of \r\nvisual brilliance like intermittent lightning, events start to dovetail,\r\n and there are scenes with a Freudian psychiatrist (wearing an eyepatch \r\nand a pirate's hat), and a pretty girl who shows up at the laundromat \r\n(Amara Karan, well-known for her performance as Rita, or \"Sweet Lime\", \r\nin Wes Anderson's \"The Darjeeling Limited\"), as well as an actual serial killer on the loose who just wants to be loved because \r\nhe was abandoned as a child. The film is too cynical to play any of this\r\n sentimentally: the \"wounded inner child\" sub-plot is obviously supposed\r\n to be snarky and ironic, and it is. But the film is haunted by its \r\nsuperior first half.\n\r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" is not, actually, fantastic, but it was\r\n inventive enough to hold my interest, weird enough to be intriguing, \r\nand bold in some of its visual experiments. At the center of it all is \r\nSimon Pegg; terrified and manic, talking to himself, racing around in \r\nstained Fruit of the Looms, kitchen knife glued to his hand. It is a \r\ncompelling and comedic portrait of creativity, obsession, and psychosis. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
