{"Title": "Life of Crime", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The late great Elmore Leonard, on whose novel \u201cThe Switch\u201d\r\nthis movie is based, gets an executive producer credit on the movie. It\u2019s\r\nsignificant, perhaps, that said credit doesn\u2019t appear until after the movie\u2019s\r\nplayed out. Shows a certain confidence on the part of the other filmmakers:\r\nthey didn\u2019t feel the need to stack the deck with an emblem of Leonard\u2019s\r\napproval at the film\u2019s onset. It turns out, the confidence was warranted: \u201cLife\r\nof Crime\u201d is a pretty engaging, and pretty authentically Leonardesque, comedic\r\ncrime movie. While it doesn\u2019t hit the highs of the very best movies based on\r\nthe author\u2019s works\u2014those would be Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cOut of Sight\u201d and\r\nQuentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cJackie Brown,\u201d two outstanding examples of American\r\nnarrative cinema of the \u201890s\u2014it\u2019s also far less slick and ingratiating than the\r\nwatchable but very Hollywood-processed likes of \u201cGet Shorty\u201d and \u201cBe Cool.\u201d  Advertisement The assets of \u201cLife Of Crime\u201d include a relatively credible\r\n1978 Detroit setting, a generous array of seamy characters with seamy\r\naspirations (and interesting ways of talking), and a pretty first-rate cast\r\nplaying those characters. John Hawkes and the performer usually known as Mos\r\nDef, here going by the name Yasiin Bey (no, I don\u2019t know why) are the criminals\r\nLouis and Ordell, and yes, these are the same characters who turn up in \u201cRum\r\nPunch,\u201d which was the novel on which \u201cJackie Brown\u201d is based. For the purposes\r\nof this story, both of these bad guys are a little less\u2026awful than they are in\r\nTarantino\u2019s film. Point of fact, they\u2019re kind of likable, especially Louis.\r\nHe\u2019s first seen being talked into a kidnapping scheme by Bey\u2019s Ordell, who\r\nsubsequently proves his get-the-criminal-job-done bonafides by facing down an\r\nobstreperous pimp. Ordell\u2019s scheme is to kidnap the wife of a corrupt local\r\nbusinessman, and demand as ransom the money he\u2019s been secretly stashing down in\r\na tax-shelter bank in the Bahamas. There are already a lot of holes in this\r\nscheme to begin with\u2014Leonard\u2019s crooks are rarely the brightest bulbs on the\r\nChristmas tree\u2014but the biggest comes to light after the pair kidnap the\r\ndisillusioned wife, Mickey, and stash her in the home of an accomplice who\u2019s a\r\nNazi gun nut. That is, Mickey\u2019s husband, stiff-necked drunkard and all-around\r\nunpleasant fellow Frank, isn\u2019t all that interested in getting his wife back.\r\nAnd he\u2019s also got a little girlfriend at his Caribbean love nest, and she sees\r\nan opportunity in Mickey\u2019s misfortune.  Before I got off on the plot synopsis I was praising the\r\ncast, and of course Hawkes and to a lesser degree the artist formerly known as\r\nMos Def are reliable screen goods. As are Tim Robbins as Frank (a role\r\nthat would have looked tailor-made for Christopher MacDonald 20 years ago),\r\nIsla Fisher as Frank\u2019s, um, little chippie, Mark Boone Junior as the Nazi gun\r\nnut, and Will Forte as a social peer of the unhappy couple who\u2019s got a weird thing\r\nfor Mickey. The big surprise here is Aniston, who gives one of her best if not\r\nbest ever movie performances here. Although she\u2019s the female lead, she really lets\r\nherself melt into the ensemble, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the part or if she\u2019s\r\nreally upped her acting game, but her performance is measured, engrossing, and\r\nempathy-generating without any overt\r\nstriving, cutesy stuff, or sitcom-style tics. She actually develops quite a\r\nrapport with Hawkes, not a fellow you expect her to mix with either in\r\ncharacter or not. The amusing twists and turns of the script, the multiple\r\ninstances of bracing humor and consistent tension, help the cast bring this\r\nsmall-scale thriller to the place it clearly wants to be. Well worth seeing,\r\nparticularly for Leonard people.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
