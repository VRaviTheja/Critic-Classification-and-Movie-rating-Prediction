{"Title": "Jason Bourne", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cJason Bourne\u201d may entice ticket buyers with prospects of a creative and adrenalin-pumping reunion between Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass, a duo that went beyond typical blockbuster expectations\r\nwith \u201cThe Bourne Supremacy\u201d and \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum.\u201d Being a fan of both of\r\nthose movies, I too had high hopes for a return to form for the character who\r\nshares a monogram with 007. But it\u2019s mere minutes into \u201cJason Bourne\u201d that something is wrong. Is it the stoic, nearly dialogue-less (25 lines in the\r\nentire film) take on Bourne? Is it the more-hyperactive-than-ever action\r\ncinematography and editing, designed to make every phone call answered and\r\nstrident walk taken seem important?\r\nHow about the familiarity of a plot that literally echoes questions these\r\ncharacters have already asked and answered? \u201cJason Bourne\u201d is a film I kept trying to like. It just wouldn\u2019t let me. Advertisement After learning the truth of his progression from David Webb\r\nto superspy Jason Bourne in the previous two Greengrass films and, of course,\r\nDoug Liman\u2019s \u201cThe Bourne Identity,\u201d JB (Matt Damon) is essentially in hiding.\r\nSure, he pops up for the occasional street fight, but he\u2019s a loner, the kind of\r\nguy with no current attachments, deeply off the grid. (It\u2019s worth\r\nnoting that Greengrass and co-writer Christopher Rouse are just barely\r\ninterested in setting up where Bourne has been and what he\u2019s up to in 2016.) It\u2019s\r\nmere minutes before Nicky (Julia Stiles) drags Bourne back on the radar of\r\nthe nefarious Powers That Be, this time personified by CIA Director Robert\r\nDewey (Tommy Lee Jones). Nicky wants to give Bourne even more of the background\r\nbehind the Treadstone project, particularly the details about what really\r\nhappened to Bourne\u2019s father, Richard Webb (Gregg Henry). Of course, Dewey can\u2019t let that happen, and he plans to use\r\nCIA agent Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) and an assassin known merely as \u201cAsset\u201d\r\n(Vincent Cassel) to keep his undercover dealings undercover. One of the reasons\r\nthat Dewey is particularly panicked about the return of Bourne is that he\u2019s\r\nalso deeply involved with a tech pioneer named Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed,\r\ncurrently seen on HBO's \u201cThe Night Of\u201d), the head of a company called Deep Dream that promises intense levels of privacy to its customers but has been working\r\nwith the CIA in secret. \u201cJason Bourne\u201d includes several of today\u2019s\r\ngreatest hot button concerns\u2014internet privacy, government intrusion\u2014but they feel like window dressing.\u00a0 Matt Damon said in a press conference in 2007 that he thought his\r\niteration of Jason Bourne was over; he had reached the end point of his\r\ncharacter\u2019s journey, his search for his identity. He stated, \u201c\u2026 all of that\r\ninternal propulsive mechanism that drives the character is not there, so if\r\nthere was to be another one then it would have to be a complete\r\nreconfiguration, you know, where do you go from there? For me I kind of feel\r\nlike the story that we set out to tell is has now been told.\u201d He clearly still\r\nfeels that way. Damon can be a complex, character-driven actor with the right\r\nmaterial, but his heart\u2019s not in this. Tommy Lee Jones feels even less invested with the little bit of character he\u2019s been given, and poor Alicia Vikander might as well be named Plot Device in that we know exactly what her\r\narc is going to be from the minute we see her. Perhaps worst of all, Greengrass\r\nfinds a way to waste Vincent Cassel, one of our most physically vibrant and\r\nmenacing actors. Cassel does most of his acting scowling through a sniper scope, and\r\nisn\u2019t allowed to really break out until the end of the film. Only Riz Ahmed makes\r\nany impact on a performance level, doing a lot with very little\u2014watch the way\r\nhe subtly plays a successful businessman who knows the skeletons are about to\r\nfall out of his closet. There's a much better version of \"Jason Bourne\" that focuses on him, contrasting his arc as a man caught up in something greater than himself with our hero's. Advertisement Ahmed registers because one senses an urgency to his character\u2019s plight, which is not the case with the\r\nrest of the film. Rarely has there been so much intensity in the pursuit of a\r\nstory that feels like it has no stakes. When \u201cJason Bourne\u201d is done, ask yourself\r\nwhat everyone was yelling, running and fighting about. Good luck coming up\r\nwith a satisfying answer. It\u2019s as if Greengrass and company knew that they couldn't orchestrate an intriguing new arc for their beloved character, so they just repeated one. The film is like Jason Bourne fan fiction in how much it\r\ncompletely reworks things we\u2019ve seen before, only with a few more years of cyberterrorism\r\nbuzzwords to give viewers the illusion of not just depth but a plot.\u00a0 Even Greengrass\u2019 trademark style feels uninspired. Barry\r\nAckroyd (\u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d) is an undeniably talented cinematographer, but his\r\nstyle doesn\u2019t have the same kinetic energy as Oliver Wood\u2019s work in the\r\noriginal trilogy, which put us right in the middle of the action. It\u2019s a fine\r\nline, but a crucial one; Wood\u2019s camera feels urgent, as if we might get\r\npunched too, whereas Ackroyd\u2019s feels cluttered and desperate. Returning\r\neditor Christopher Rouse (who\u2019s cut all of Greengrass\u2019 films) is the technical\r\nMVP here, giving the film a propulsive energy that could convince some people they\u2019re watching something fun and exciting just by sheer force. However, when\r\nit\u2019s over, even viewers more eager to forgive this failed creative reunion will wonder what it is that they just watched, and what purpose\r\nit serves other than financial. And why no one figured out a new, engaging way\r\nto tell a story that\u2019s already been told.", "Critic": "Beta"}
