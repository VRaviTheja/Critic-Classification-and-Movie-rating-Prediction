{"Title": "Get Out", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "This review was originally published on January 24, 2017, as a part of our Sundance Film Festival coverage. With the ambitious and challenging \u201cGet Out,\u201d which premiered in a secret screening at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, Jordan Peele reveals that we may someday consider directing the greatest talent of this fascinating actor and writer. We knew from his days on \u201cKey & Peele\u201d and in feature comedies that he was a multiple threat, but his directorial debut is a complex, accomplished genre hybrid that should alter his business card. \u201cGet Out\u201d feels fresh and sharp in a way that studio horror movies almost never do. It is both unsettling and hysterical, often in the same moment, and it is totally unafraid to call people on their racist bullshit. When he introduced the film in Park City, he revealed that it started with an attempt to write a movie he hadn\u2019t seen before. We need more directors willing to take risks with films like \"Get Out.\" Advertisement To be fair, Peele is clearly riffing on some films he has seen before, including \u201cThe Stepford Wives\u201d and \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby,\u201d although with a charged, racial twist. His film is essentially about that unsettling feeling when you know you don\u2019t belong somewhere; when you know you\u2019re unwanted or perhaps even wanted too much. Peele infuses the age-old genre foundation of knowing something is wrong behind the closed doors around you with a racial, satirical edge. What if going home to meet your girlfriend\u2019s white parents wasn\u2019t just uncomfortable but downright life-threatening? \u201cGet Out\u201d opens with a fantastic tone-setter. A young man (the great Keith Stanfield, in two other movies at this year\u2019s Sundance and fantastic on FX\u2019s \u201cAtlanta\u201d) is walking down a suburban street, joking with someone on the phone about how he always gets lost because all the streets sound the same. A car passes him, turns around, and slowly starts following him. It\u2019s an otherwise empty street, so the guy knows something is wrong. Suddenly, and perfectly staged in terms of Peele\u2019s direction, the intensity of the situation is amplified and we are thrust into a world in which the safe-looking suburbs are anything but.  Cut to our protagonists, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams of \u201cGirls\u201d), preparing to go home to meet her parents. Rose hasn\u2019t told them he\u2019s black, which she blows off as no big deal, but he\u2019s wary. His TSA Agent buddy (a hysterical LilRel Howery) warns him against going too, but Chris is falling in love with Rose. He\u2019ll have to meet them eventually. And Rose swears her dad would have voted for Obama a third time if he could have. From the minute that Chris and Rose arrive at her parents\u2019 house, something is unsettling. Sure, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener) seem friendly enough, but almost too much so, like they\u2019re looking to impress Chris. More unnerving is the demeanor of a groundskeeper named Walter (Marcus Henderson) and a housekeeper named Georgina (Betty Gabriel), who almost appear to be like the pod people from \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers.\u201d There\u2019s just something wrong. But, as we so often do in social or racial situations, Chris keeps trying to excuse their behavior\u2014maybe Walter is jealous and maybe Georgina has an issue with Chris being with a white woman. The lurking presence of Rose\u2019s odd brother (Caleb Landry Jones), who often looks like he\u2019s auditioning for a remake of \u201cA Clockwork Orange,\u201d doesn\u2019t help. Chris goes out to have a smoke one night, and, well, things start to get even stranger in ways I won\u2019t spoil\u2014in fact, the preview gives away way too much. Avoid it if you can. Advertisement \u201cGet Out\u201d is a slow-burn of a film for its first half as Peele piles up the clues that something is wrong. Or could Chris just be overreacting to everyday racial tension? Peele\u2019s greatest gift here is in the way he walks that fine line, staging exchanges that happen all the time but imbuing them with a greater degree of menace. As white partygoers comment on Chris\u2019 genetically-blessed physical gifts, the mind is racing as to what exactly the greater purpose of this visit is for this young man, a minority in a sea of white people who seem to want to own him, which is itself a razor-sharp commentary on the way we often seek to possess cultural aspects other than our own. Then Peele drops his hammer. The final act of \u201cGet Out\u201d is an unpredictable thrill ride. As a writer, Peele doesn\u2019t quite bring all of his elements together in the climax in the way I wish he would, but he proves to be a strong visual artist as a director, finding unique ways to tell a story that goes increasingly off the rails. The insanity of the final act allows some of the satirical, racially-charged issues to drop away, which is slightly disappointing. He\u2019s playing with so many interesting ideas when it comes to race that I wish the film felt a bit more satisfying in its payoff, even if that disappointment is amply offset by the pure intensity of the final scenes, during which Peele displays a skill with horror action that I didn\u2019t know he had.\u00a0 Peele works well with actors too, drawing a great leading man turn from Kaluuya, letting Williams essentially riff on her \u201cGirls\u201d persona, and knowing exactly what to do with Whitford & Keener, both of whom have always had that dangerous edge to their amiability. They\u2019re excellent at working something sinister into their gracious host routines. Most importantly, Peele knows how to keep his concept front and center. \u201cGet Out\u201d is not a film that takes breaks for comedy routines (even if Howery allows a little relief, it's often in the context of how he's convinced all white people want black sex slaves), keeping us on edge and uncertain from the opening scene to the final one. He understands that every time a black man goes home to visit his white girlfriend\u2019s parents, there is uncertainty and unease. He\u2019s merely turning that up, using an easily identifiable racial tension to make a horror movie. Many of our greatest genre filmmakers have done exactly the same thing\u2014amplifying fears already embedded in the human condition for the purpose of movie horror. We just don\u2019t often see something quite so ambitious from a February horror flick or a first-time director. Even if the second half doesn\u2019t quite fulfill the promise of the first, Peele doesn\u2019t just deserve credit for trying something so daring; he should have producers knocking down his door to see what else he\u2019s never seen before.
