{"Title": "Jessabelle", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "There are a lot of dark family secrets in \"Jessabelle,\" involving drawers of forgotten objects, Voodoo ceremonies in the woods, \r\nand VHS tapes containing ominous messages from beyond the grave. Steeped\r\n in Southern Gothic melodrama, \"Jessabelle\" is interesting in some of \r\nthe small details, and in its strong sense of the Louisiana bayou \r\natmosphere, and then it completely falls apart when it starts being a \r\nhorror film. The trauma in the family story is full of potential, having\r\n to do with identity and how Jessabelle understands her own life, but \r\nall of that is short-changed for cheap scares that just are not scary \r\nenough and a preposterous plot that won't withstand the most cursory \r\nexamination. Director Kevin Greutert, after directing multiple entries \r\nin the \"Saw\" franchise, feels adrift in tamer material. He responds to \r\nthe Flannery O'Connor-esque qualities of the script (written by Robert \r\nBen Garant), and there are details there that ring really true, but then\r\n he falls back on a lot of tired tropes from other horror films, missing\r\n the mark almost every step of the way. Advertisement In\r\n the opening scene, Jessabelle (Sarah Snook) is about to move in with \r\nher boyfriend: she's pregnant and they are both excited. On their way to\r\n the new place, they get into a car accident. He dies, she loses the \r\nbaby, and her legs are crushed. Wheelchair-bound now, she moves home to \r\nlive with her gloomy father (David Andrews). Jessabelle's mother died \r\nwhen Jessabelle was a baby; she and her father barely speak to one \r\nanother when she returns home. Expressionless, he leads her through the \r\nhouse to the dead mother's old bedroom, untouched since her death. \r\nJessabelle will sleep there since it's on the ground floor. The\r\n house is the scariest element of the film; it is a masterpiece of a set\r\n (Jade Healy was production designer). Red brick on the outside, with \r\ntiny squinting windows, it is yawningly empty on the inside, rooms \r\ncareening off into the distance, unfurnished except for random gigantic \r\ncupboards and cabinets shoved up against the walls. It feels like a \r\nplace where time has stopped. Seen mainly from Jessabelle's point of \r\nview, rolling through it in her wheelchair, the house is disorienting. \r\nYou never get the real lay of the land. You never see the upstairs.  Jessabelle\r\n keeps seeing and hearing strange things in the house. She glimpses a \r\nstrange girl with long black hair (reminiscent of the girl from \"The \r\nRing\") through the sheer curtains hanging around her mother's bed. \r\n(Despite how frightening the vision was, Jessabelle keeps closing those \r\ncurtains every night, making one think she enjoys being \r\nterrified). In a box hidden under the bed, Jessabelle finds VHS tapes \r\ncontaining video-taped messages made for her by her mother (Joelle \r\nCarter) in the last months before giving birth. The \r\nmother, at first, is filled with joy and anticipation, bringing tears of\r\n happiness to Jessabelle's eyes as she watches. Soon, though, a dark \r\nforeboding mood intrudes (Joelle Carter is rivetingly uneasy in the \r\nrole, leaning forward to whisper to the camera, \"Don't tell Daddy about \r\nthe Tarot cards.\") Advertisement In a fit of fury, \r\nJessabelle's dad throws out the video tapes and also tosses her \r\nwheelchair into the lake. Things go south from there. Jessabelle finds \r\nan unlikely ally in a high school boyfriend named Preston (Mark Webber),\r\n who is married and yet seems to have a ton of free time to drive \r\nJessabelle around as she investigates her past. Their journey leads them\r\n deep into the bayou, and involves Voodoo altars, strange graveyards, \r\nand an old white-haired woman with giant terrified eyes moaning a Creole\r\n chant. Some of this ends up having undeniable racist implications, the\r\n black characters presented as completely \"Other,\" with no humanity \r\nwhatsoever, just frightening creatures with strange rituals emanating \r\nhostility and evil.  The scenes where \r\nJessabelle watches her mother on video tape are the best in the film. In\r\n them, there is emotional communication flowing between the past and the\r\n present, longings and needs on both sides, giving a unique look at the \r\nmother-daughter bond: the mother needs to tell her story, and maybe warn\r\n her daughter about something, and the daughter needs to feel close to \r\nthe mother she never knew. The fact that Jessabelle starts out by losing her own baby is never mentioned; it's a huge dropped ball (one of \r\nmany in the script).  The main dropped \r\nball in the film has to do with Jessabelle's injured legs. She \r\ncannot move without assistance, and is completely at the mercy of \r\nwhatever horrible thing comes at her. But \"Jessabelle\" totally lacks a \r\nvisceral sense of how vulnerable she is; how trapped she is, physically.\r\n One needs only to think of the bone-chilling scenes in \"Wait Until \r\nDark,\" where blind Audrey Hepburn walks through her apartment, unaware \r\nthat three thugs loom all around her in the shadows. As capable as she \r\nis as a character, she cannot see what we in the audience can see. Our \r\nhelplessness is activated ferociously by her predicament, filling \"Wait \r\nUntil Dark\" with a sense of pure dread. It seems a no-brainer that \r\n\"Jessabelle\", with its heroine in a wheelchair, should work on that same\r\n level, but it doesn't. Like so much else in the film, her physical \r\ndisability just sits there onscreen, but unexamined beyond a facile \r\nsurface level. Advertisement Sarah Snook is good in \r\nthe title role, especially in the solo scenes where she watches her \r\nmother's video-taped messages. There's a ton of bad vibes from her \r\ngrumpy silent Daddy, there's a lot of mystery in who her beautiful \r\nmother really was, the secrets she hid. At one point, Jessabelle finds a\r\n couple of steamy romance novels her mother hid in a drawer, and \r\nJessabelle says, delighted, and almost embarrassed, \u00a0\"Oh my word. Thank \r\nyou, Mama.\" These are the true Southern-fried guts of \"Jessabelle.\" \r\nThese moments are specific and lived-in. If only it hadn't decided to be\r\n a horror film instead.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
