{"Title": "The World of Kanako", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cThe World of Kanako\u201d contains elements of \u201cBad Lieutenant,\u201d\r\n\u201cOldboy\u201d and even \u201cThe Searchers\u201d but filtered through a lens that\u2019s so covered\r\nin grime and blood that many people will consider the nihilistic trip not worth\r\nthe effort. It\u2019s a film that\u2019s tempting to dismiss because of its bleak,\r\nmisanthropic viewpoint on the world, but that would be discounting the quality\r\nof the filmmaking and the riveting performance at its center. Based on Akio\r\nFukamachi\u2019s \u201cHateshinaki Kawaki,\u201d Tetsuya Nakashima\u2019s \u201cThe World of Kanako\u201d is\r\nsuch an in-your-face experience that its opening credits includes words\r\nsprawled across it like the old Adam West \u201cBatman,\u201d and those words are \u201cKill!\u201d\r\nand \u201cFuck!\u201d It sets a tone. Advertisement Lest you think \u201cThe World of Kanako\u201d is a playful homage or\r\na stylish ride, be warned. This is a movie with enough gore, rape, murder, drug\r\nuse and horrible behavior to make Takashi Miike blink. It is not an easy watch.\r\nAnd it does feel sometimes like excess for the sake of excess. But then star\r\nKoji Yakusho will do something unexpected emotionally or Nakashima and cinematographer\r\nSh\u00f4ichi At\u00f4 will find a striking image and the movie will win you back. Like the\r\ncharacters who are constantly either in love or murderous rage, Nakashima\r\npushes and pulls at his own audience. The great Yakusho (\u201c13 Assassins\u201d) plays Akikazu Fujishima,\r\na retired cop who seems to live for nothing. Not long ago, he caught his wife\r\nhaving an affair and plowed into their car before pulling the man from the vehicle\r\nand beating him. He hasn\u2019t seen his daughter Kanako (Nana Komatsu) in a long\r\ntime, pops pills and has taken to vomiting in rainy alleys. When he learns that\r\nKanako is missing, he is given new purpose, although his misanthropy makes him\r\nsomething of a loose cannon. As he descends to a world of drugs and\r\nprostitution to try and find Kanako, Nakashima flashes back and forth\r\nchronologically to tie the two timelines together and reveal what happened to\r\nKanako.  From the beginning, \u201cThe World of Kanako\u201d is designed in a\r\nway to be unsettling. The opening scenes with close-ups of sweaty faces\r\nspurting lines like \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d set the dual themes of\r\nthe piece\u2014love and violence\u2014but they do so in a way that\u2019s discomforting.\r\nThere\u2019s a sense of displacement and confusion, especially for the first act,\r\nthat\u2019s not unlike a late night in a club. You barely hear snippets of\r\nconversation over the loud music, and Fujishima and editor Yoshiyuki Koike don\u2019t\r\nhold a shot for more than a few seconds. Even scenes of dialogue between two\r\nrelatively normal characters\u2014like when Fujishima is talking to Kanako\u2019s\r\nclassmates or her doctor\u2014are cut together from several angles.  Advertisement At first, Fujishima feels just like a straightforward anti-hero,\r\nthe bad cop trying to do one last good thing, but that interpretation changes\r\nrelatively quickly. He\u2019s not a hero. He\u2019s the kind of guy who, while staying\r\nwith her to help find his daughter, rapes and beats his ex-wife. He picks up a\r\nhooker who he drunkenly calls his daughter\u2019s name. Yakusho is fearless, playing\r\nmost of the film hunched over, bloody and sweaty like a man who has literally\r\ntaken himself to the brink of death and no longer cares what happens to him. It\u2019s\r\nsuch a daring performance that it makes the violence of the piece more visceral\r\nbecause we believe this man is capable of surviving anything and doing anything\r\nto get his daughter back. There\u2019s a parking garage shoot-out/stab-out that\r\nneeds to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s \u201cOldboy\u201d-claw-hammer-scene insane. Admittedly, I grew tired of the nihilism of \u201cThe World of\r\nKanako\u201d long before it was over, and I have a high tolerance for that sort of\r\nthing, so that has to be taken into account when assessing the overall product,\r\nbut the quality of the filmmaking never flags. You just have to ask yourself if\r\nthe journey to this ridiculously violent world, however well-constructed, is one worth taking.", "Critic": "Beta"}
