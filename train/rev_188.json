{"Title": "The Rewrite", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "There was a period spanning from the near-mid 1990s to the\r\nearly 2000s when a particular kind of Hugh Grant movie ruled the romantic\r\ncomedy world. I don\u2019t mean every single Hugh Grant movie, but quite a few Hugh\r\nGrant movies, mind you. I call them the \u201cRedeemable S**ts\u201d films. That is, they\r\nfeature Mr. Grant at his slickest and most glibly charming, except he\u2019s a\r\nterrible-to-awful cad (but not to a Ted Bundy extent, of course, and\r\nthankfully) except also that he can be\r\nsaved, and it\u2019s only through forced exposure to and interaction with Better\r\nPeople that he can be saved.  Advertisement This formula, which arguably reached its commercial and, um,\r\nartistic peak with 2002\u2019s \u201cAbout A Boy\u201d drives Grant\u2019s latest picture, \u201cThe\r\nRewrite, \u201c which was written and directed by Marc Lawrence, who also created\r\n2007\u2019s \u201cMusic and Lyrics,\u201d an intermittently diverting rom-com co-starring Drew\r\nBarrymore that suggested that maybe a breather from the tried and true might be\r\nin order. Unfortunately for Grant, that breather consisted of the universally\r\nface-palmed 2009 \u201cDid You Hear About The Morgans\u201d and the misbegotten Wachowski\r\nliterary adaptation \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d in 2012. \u201cThe Rewrite,\u201d in which Grant plays\r\na once-acclaimed, now down-on-his-luck Hollywood screenwriter compelled to head\r\neast and teach a scenario-crafting class at a university in remote, cloudy,\r\nfine-cuisine-challenged Binghamton, New York, must have felt as cozy as a\r\nfavorite sweater to the actor.  And indeed, he gives great Hugh Grant cad once he touches\r\ndown in the college town, immediately insulting Jane Austen to an icy\r\ndepartment head (Alison Janney) whose specialty is Jane Austen, bedding down a\r\ncomely student (Bella Heathcote) even before convening his first session,\r\nadvising a \u201cStar Wars\u201d nerd to join a frat, and dribbling condescension on a\r\nplucky single mom who\u2019s going to school to improve herself but who may in fact\r\nhave some real talent.  Given that the aforementioned plucky single mom is played by\r\nMarisa Tomei, you have an idea where all this is going to end up. And your idea\r\nis likely right, although I have to admit I half-lost a bet with myself I made\r\nthirty-five minutes in as to what the big third-act turnaround was going to be.\r\nI say \u201chalf-lost\u201d because I was correct in terms of the fundamental principle\r\nthe storyline was bound to uphold. As predictable as it is, and as sometimes\r\ncloying as a few of the movie-insider jokes can get (\u201cReynolds or Gosling?\u201d one\r\nstarstruck student breathlessly asks when Grant\u2019s character alludes to a \u201cRyan\u201d\r\nhaving some interest in a fictitious project he\u2019s bragging about), this movie\r\nearned my \u201calmost good\u201d rating of two and a half stars on account of the indeed\r\nplucky and winning work of the cast, which also includes J.K. Simmons and Chris\r\nElliott as campus \u201ctypes.\u201d Each has an amusing moment or three, they all gel\r\npretty well, and they keep the movie watchable as it hops from one sweet-spot-hitting-clich\u00e9\r\nto another. By no means watch this if you\u2019re looking for a nourishing cinematic\r\nexperience. But if your idea of a cozy rom-com is an old Hugh Grant one, this\r\nhas some cine-comfort-food-carbs for you.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
