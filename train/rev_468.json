{"Title": "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "It\u2019s hard to say whether \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,\u201d about a group of teenagers who turn into videogame characters, is a sequel to the 1995 Robin Williams hit \u201cJumanji,\u201d a remake, a reboot, or something else. But it\u2019s definitely the kind of movie that works the name of a classic rock song into its title and makes sure to blast it during the end credits, so that people who were in their twenties during the 1990s and now have kids of their own (and probably took them to this film) can feel that Pavlovian tingle.\u00a0 Advertisement That description makes the new \u201cJumanji\u201d sound like a cash-grab, and in lot of ways it is\u2014studios are so enamored with the notion that pre-existing intellectual properties are box office insurance that they\u2019re far more likely to greenlight this than something genuinely new, even though exactly no one has spent the last two decades saying, \u201cI wish somebody would make another \u2018Jumanji.\u2019\u201d At the same time, though, this is a\u00a0likable, funny diversion, and sometimes more than that. It has enough twists and surprises to pull viewers along, despite the fact that writer-director Jake Kasdan\u2019s story (co-written with four people) is ultimately not much meatier than the one from a 1990s videogame that the characters end up inhabiting after getting sentenced to a \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d-type detention at school. (In the original film, the titular diversion is an old-fashioned board game, just like in the source material, Chris van Allsburg\u2019s popular children\u2019s book.) The protagonists here are\u00a0Spencer (Alex Wolff), an earnest nerd; Spencer\u2019s onetime best friend Fridge (Ser\u2019Darius Blain), a football star who ends up grounded after authorities realize Alex wrote a homework assignment for him; Bethany (Madison Iseman), a classic snotty Heather-type who\u2019s addicted to her smartphone and takes selfies constantly; and the bookish, socially anxious Martha (Morgan Turner). They all have insecurities and issues. Once they end up inside the Jumanji videogame, these same characters are played by Dwayne Johnson (as Spencer the nerd); Kevin Hart (as Fridge the jock); Karen Gillan (as the super-fit avatar of Martha), and Jack Black, of all people, as Bethany. There are supposed to be five characters in the game-space, though, and we meet the fifth in due time: Alex Vreeke (Nick Jonas), who is introduced as an energetic teenager in the film\u2019s 1996 prologue, only to get sucked into the game and become The Local Missing Boy whose endlessly grieving family still lives in their now-decrepit house.\u00a0 The body-switching gag threatens to wear out its welcome quickly (hah ha, the scrawny nerd looks like Dwayne Johnson now, and the awkward girl has washboard abs!), but the actors take their assignments to play teenagers so seriously that the film surfs along on a wave of poker-faced earnestness, mixing moments of pathos in with its super-broad slapstick. (Except for Dan Castellaneta\u2019s Homer Simpson, nobody screams in pain more hilariously than Kevin Hart.) At certain points you might feel as though you\u2019re watching the longest, most lavishly produced \u201cSaturday\u00a0Night Live\u201d sketch ever, complete with lush jungle scenery (the film was shot partly on location in Hawaii) and attacks by CGI hippos, rhinos, monkeys, crocodiles and the like.\u00a0But since the entire thing plays like a 10-year old\u2019s Disney Channel fantasy of what adolescence will be like, it works well enough, especially when coupled with intense discussions of the game\u2019s rules (how many lives you get, how many levels there are, how to lift the curse from the land, etc).\u00a0 Advertisement Both the videogame\u2019s construction and its gender politics are very \u201890s. The movie is aware of this and makes fun of it, though there\u2019s a bit of an eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too aspect to the way it puts Johnson and Gillan's bodies on display. There are occasional jolts of mayhem, thanks mainly to the motorcycle-riding ninjas who do the bidding of the movie\u2019s villain John Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), a demonic figure who wants to control the Jaguar\u2019s Eye and claim dominion over the land. The action scenes are constructed with a bit of panache and manage to be exciting though you\u2019re never seriously worried that any major character is going to lose all of their lives. Kasdan, a veteran filmmaker who happens to be the son of \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d and \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, has an old-school sense of how to build those kinds of sequences. The shots are thoughtfully composed, for the most part, and you always know where you are and what's at stake from moment to moment. The script\u2019s scenarios allow for charming, often faintly surreal funny character moments, as when Black\u2019s round yet flouncy Bethany instructs Gillan\u2019s super-fit but still physically awkward Martha on how to be sexy. Black\u2019s \"hey, sailor\" walk evokes Bugs Bunny in drag, and Gillan\u2019s subsequent \u201cseductive\u201d dance to distract some guards looks as if she\u2019s trying to shake sand out of her shorts while simultaneously dealing with a bad case of swimmer\u2019s ear. The film doesn\u2019t have the nerve to follow some of its more subversive ideas (such as Bethany lusting after Alex) to their logical conclusions, probably because this is an expensive project that\u2019s terrified of alienating a certain sector of the public (imagine the walkouts if Jack Black lip-locked with Nick Jonas in something other than a CPR situation). But it\u2019s still more surprising in more ways than it had to be, and the performers are clearly having such fun playing insecure teenagers that you stay involved even when the thinness of the enterprise becomes undeniable. This is a two-and-a-half star movie, honestly, bumped up a notch because the actors are likable, the film doesn\u2019t have a cruel thought in its head, and the sentimental finale feels earned.", "Critic": "Delta"}
