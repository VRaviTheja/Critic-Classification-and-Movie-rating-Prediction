{"Title": "Moebius", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Kim Ki-Duk\u2019s \u201cMoebius,\u201d the follow-up to his Golden\r\nLion-winning \u201cPieta,\u201d takes many of the bizarre, incestuous beats of that drama\r\nand twists, contorts and morphs them into black comedy. Although many who read\r\neven the comparatively tame plot description that comes shortly in this review\r\nwill probably doubt the comedic undertones of the latest from the controversial\r\nKorean director. Trust me. Kim uses provocation through extreme imagery to\r\nsatirical ends. He wants you to squirm, be uncomfortable, and even laugh at the\r\ninsanity of what\u2019s happening on the screen. And, again, trust me, the word insanity is not an\r\nexaggeration in this case. Advertisement \u201cMoebius\u201d is a three-actor, four-character piece that plays\r\nlike Greek tragedy filtered through the lens of extreme filmmakers like Takashi\r\nMiike. As soon as one thinks that Kim has pushed the envelope narratively and\r\nvisually, he has something else disturbing up his bloody sleeve. The three\r\nentirely committed, fearless performers put through the physical and emotional\r\nmotions by Kim carry a film that is the definition of \u201cnot for everyone\u201d but \u201cMoebius\u201d\r\nworks on its terms. Its twisted, Oedipal, sadomasochistic, castrated terms. A man (Jae-hyeon Jo) is having an affair. A mother (Eun-woo\r\nLee, who also plays the mistress) knows about the affair and she\u2019s cracking in\r\nevery possible way. She confronts her husband and attempts to castrate him. She\r\nfails. So she castrates her son (Young-ju Seo) and flees the home. The father\r\nfeels such grief over his son\u2019s castration for his own sins that he becomes\r\nobsessed with trying to find ways for the young man to achieve sexual release.\r\nHis journey into the kind of Google searches that the authorities sometimes\r\ntrack results in the discovery that some people get off by rubbing stones on\r\ntheir skin until they bleed while others who have been castrated have found\r\nrelease by having knives shoved in their back and twisted around. Did I\r\nmention that dad's mistress becomes the object of sexual obsession of the son?\r\nCareful readers will note that the mistress and mother being played by the same\r\nwoman is not thematically coincidental. And then dear old crazy mom comes home\r\nand things get REALLY weird. Did I mention all of this is conveyed without a single line\r\nof dialogue? Kim\u2019s film is not a silent one a la \u201cThe Artist\u201d but a film in\r\nwhich the characters simply never speak. Oh, they make a variety of other\r\nnoises, most of them guttural. It almost feels like Kim was trying to see how\r\nmuch human suffering a filmmaker could convey without the crutch of dialogue to\r\ndo so. And so we hear groans, moans, cries, and every other sound one can\r\nimagine that doesn\u2019t include actual pronunciation.  The decision to craft \u201cMoebius\u201d as a dialogue-free piece has\r\na dual impact. First, it heightens viewer involvement as we have to lean\r\nforward, concentrate heavily on the blocking and staging to follow a story that\r\nhas no subtitles or other traditional sign markers. Second, it creates an\r\nexaggerated world like a theatrical piece that chooses movement or\r\ninterpretative dance, for example, to convey its themes instead of narrative.\r\nAnd that element adds to the black comedy aspect of \u201cMoebius\u201d\u2014this is inherently\r\nridiculous but it\u2019s made more so by no one commenting in any way through\r\ndialogue on that ridiculousness. Advertisement To say the performers in \u201cMoebius\u201d are fearless, especially\r\nEun-woo Lee, would be understating it significantly. Kim asks an amazing\r\nphysical and emotional freedom of his actors and they all deliver. We can sit\r\nback and appreciate Kim\u2019s daring work as a commentary on the way modern society\r\ndeals with sexuality, infidelity and insanity but one shouldn\u2019t ignore the very\r\npractical nature of what\u2019s happening onscreen in some of the darker moments you\u2019ll\r\nsee in a cinema this year. Kim, like a lot of great shock artists, creates a\r\nwork so intentionally button-pushing and maniacally over-the-top that it\r\ndemands your attention. He may be one of the international cinema scene's most\r\ndivisive filmmakers but no one can argue that he\u2019s going through the motions or\r\nfailing to explore the function of his demented form.", "Critic": "Beta"}
