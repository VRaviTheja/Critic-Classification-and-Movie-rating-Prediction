{"Title": "Miss Stevens", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "A low-key and intelligent character study, \u201cMiss Stevens\u201d\r\ndoesn\u2019t escape from its indie-film commonplaces often enough to become really\r\ndistinctive, but it has enough conscientiousness about its people that it\r\ndoesn\u2019t let the commonplaces fester into movie-sinking clich\u00e9s. Directed by\r\nJulia Hart (who scripted 2014\u2019s woman-centered Civil-War-set drama \u201cThe Keeping\r\nRoom\u201d) from a screenplay she co-wrote with Jordan Horowitz, it\u2019s an offhand\r\ntribute to teaching\u00ad\u2014its titular protagonist, played by Lily Rabe, is a\r\nhigh-school English teacher of obvious sensitivity, integrity and faith in her\r\ncalling. She\u2019s just having a tough time with, you know, life, and this picture\r\nworks to capture that in a purposeful way.  Advertisement The movie begins with the slight, attractive Rabe seated in\r\na theater, reluctant to leave after the lights have gone up. We find out what\u2019s\r\nthere for her, or rather what\u2019s not there, later on. Hart leaps headlong into\r\nMiss Stevens' weekend mission: to drive three students to an off-campus drama\r\ncompetition, where the kids will deliver monologues and perhaps bring home\r\nprizes that will get their school some arts funding. The kids are: the smart\r\nand slightly stuck-up Margot (Lili Reinhart) who on first impression seems to\r\nhave a little Tracy Flick in her; the openly-gay but not overtly theatrical\r\nabout it Sam (Anthony Quintal) and the troubled but also of course meteorically\r\ntalented Billy (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet). The road trip gets off to a rocky start as\r\nMargot criticizes Miss Stevens\u2019 taste in driving tunes, terming the stuff \u201cdad\r\nmusic.\u201d Billy digs it, and yes, this is one of those movies in which the\r\ncharacters bicker about a well-known pop tune and the filmmakers let you know\r\nwhere their loyalties lie by squelching the argument and letting the \u201cgood\r\npart\u201d of said tune play out at full volume on the soundtrack. I won\u2019t spoil the\r\nsong for you but it\u2019s not a favorite of mine.  By showing his affinity for Miss Stevens early on, Billy,\r\nwho\u2019s on meds and also is obliged to take a makeup exam some time over the\r\nweekend, first stakes his imaginary claim on her emotions. He figures they are\r\ntwo lonely people who can help each other, and Miss Stevens\u2019 possibly unwise\r\nconfession of a recent emotional episode eggs him on\u2014as does his unannounced\r\ndecision to get off those aforementioned meds. Much is made in contemporary art\r\nassessment of a creator\u2019s ostensible attitude toward his or her characters;\r\nspeculation on this topic is often irrelevant and/or stupid, but this movie\r\nmakes it plain that it truly likes its characters. One way it does so is in its\r\ndisinclination to get them into scrapes of any sort that are too uncomfortable\r\nor grotesque (this is arguably a more realistic approach as well, some might\r\nsay). All of which is to say that while Miss Stevens (Rachel to her\r\nnon-students) does make some bad\r\ndecisions (such as hooking up with a married male teacher played by Rob Huebel,\r\nwhose thirst for portraying schlubby cads seems unlikely to ever be slaked),\r\nshe insists on treating Bill as her student, and working things out with him\r\nthat way.  The film moves from scene to scene with a fluid ease, and\r\nthe acting is consistently winning and credible without ever being showy. While\r\nthe movie\u2019s unprepossessing manner can\u2019t be said to backfire, exactly, its\r\nmoments of wit and observation aren\u2019t sufficiently startling to lift it out of\r\nengaging amiability. Recommended to teachers who want a \u201cthis is what it\u2019s all\r\nabout\u201d smile or two.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
