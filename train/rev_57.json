{"Title": "Sicario", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cSicario\u201d opens with two indicators of a violent world, one a discovery and one an explosion, both setting the stage for the satisfying thriller that follows.\u00a0This is a universe in which evidence of evil exists in plain sight,\r\nhiding in the walls of a house in suburban America. And it is a world in which\r\nviolence can erupt in the blink of an eye, taking lives and shattering others.\r\nAt times, \u201cSicario\u201d is a deeply satisfying, intense examination of a war with\r\nno rules of engagement, driven by a spectacular performance by Benicio Del Toro\r\nand typically mesmerizing cinematography from Roger Deakins. At other times, especially\r\nin its middle act, \u201cSicario\u201d can be frustratingly self-indulgent, filled with\r\noverhead helicopter shots of the Mexican border and a thumping, pretentious\r\nscore. It\u2019s a film that lacks the urgency of the really great thrillers, but\r\nexists in that rarefied air of refined production values on every level and a\r\nflawless ensemble. That it falls short of greatness could be considered a\r\ndisappointment, but there\u2019s still much to like here. Advertisement That opening scene features FBI Agent Kate Macy (Emily\r\nBlunt) trying to find a kidnap victim in an Arizona home. She literally barrels\r\nthrough the wall in her truck, and just takes down a target as he unloads a\r\nshotgun in her direction. The shotgun blasts a hole in the wall, revealing a\r\ndead body, wrapped in plastic. And this cadaver is not alone. Soon, they\r\ndiscover the home is filled with corpses, and their investigation leads to an\r\nexplosion. What is going on? What horror has crossed the border from the\r\nnotoriously lawless town of Juarez to Arizona?  Macy\u2019s fearlessness and quick wit draws the attention of her\r\nsuperiors, and she\u2019s brought in on a meeting for an inter-agency task force.\r\nLed by a mysterious, professionally undefined (he could be CIA) man named Matt\r\n(Josh Brolin), the people behind this task force like what they hear from Kate.\r\nThey bring her aboard, and Matt, Kate and the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del\r\nToro) head South to capture a drug trafficker and bring him back to the States for\r\nquestioning. This sequence alone justifies a look at \u201cSicario.\u201d Venturing into\r\na part of the continent in which drug lords have become so prominent that dead\r\nbodies hang in public places as messages, the team has to act quickly. On the\r\nway back from Mexico, they get stuck in traffic at the border. Cars around them\r\ncould contain the drug trafficker\u2019s cronies, waiting to strike. This scene is\r\na master class in the production of tension. Deakins uses car windows\r\nbeautifully and editor Joe Walker seamlessly cuts the action together. That the\r\nmovie never tops this sequence again is where the problems arguably start. We\r\nopen with such intensity that the lack of sizzle in the second act starts to\r\ntake a toll. Part of the problem is that Taylor Sheridan\u2019s script doesn\u2019t\r\nreally develop a protagonist. Kate is too often an observer, an unwilling and\r\nuninformed traveler on this journey. Brolin\u2019s Matt and Del Toro\u2019s Alejandro are\r\nso clearly in charge of what\u2019s happening that they\u2019re thinking of moves several\r\nmachinations away while Kate is unclear of not only what role she\u2019s supposed to\r\nplay but what roles everyone has as well. I get that this sense of confusion is\r\npart of the point. \u201cSicario,\u201d at its core, is about a world in which the lack\r\nof leadership on either side of the drug war has created complete chaos. And so\r\nit makes sense that it would feature a protagonist equally confused by the lack\r\nof ground rules. However, this makes for a film that doesn\u2019t have the emotional\r\npunch of the best thrillers, at least not until the final act when the tables\r\nare turned, and we realize that we may have been focusing on the wrong story all\r\nalong. Advertisement Despite the issues I have with the narrative of \u201cSicario,\u201d\r\nit\u2019s impossible to deny the technical elements that are so far above average,\r\nand Denis Villeneuve\u2019s skill with directing actors. He draws a great performance\r\nfrom Brolin as the kind of guy who enjoys keeping those around him uninformed.\r\nHe considers intelligence as a tool to an upper hand. Del Toro has a very\r\ndifferent purpose, one that\u2019s slowly revealed, and he\u2019s simply magnetic here.\r\nHe steals every scene he\u2019s in. Blunt is typically excellent as well, even if it\r\nfeels like the underdrawn nature of her character is the film\u2019s biggest flaw. By the time \u201cSicario\u201d gets to its final act, and Villeneuve\r\nand Deakins approach \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d territory through strikes under the cover of darkness with night vision goggles,\r\nit\u2019s impossible to nitpick the screenplay. When life and death are in play,\r\nsuch as in that scene on the freeway, and really the entire final act, \u201cSicario\u201d\r\nrises to the level I hoped it would maintain the entire time. It becomes an\r\nentire film of that opening scene\u2014a movie of secrets and the threat of constant\r\nviolence. It\u2019s about a world that we can\u2019t really even comprehend\r\nwhen it comes to its lack of order and degree of atrocities. And it\u2019s in our\r\nbackyard.", "Critic": "Beta"}
