{"Title": "The Land", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The \u201cland\u201d to which this movie\u2019s title refers is not a plot\r\nof arable property. No, it\u2019s the diminutive of Cleveland, lately the site of\r\nthe Republican National Convention, dubbed by some wags \u201cthe mistake by the\r\nlake,\u201d a site where ostensibly the heart of rock and roll is still\r\nbeating, and the non-virtual site of the actual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,\r\nsuch as it is. But seriously, Cleveland doesn\u2019t get enough credit as a seminal\r\nplace in American culture\u2014it did after all spawn Ghoulardi and Pere Ubu, whose\r\nrespective impacts are still felt today. Advertisement None of those aspects of Cleveland, I should make clear now,\r\nare made manifest or even alluded to in this movie written and directed by\r\nSteven Caple Jr. Nevertheless, it\u2019s good to see this great American city\r\nthat\u2019s rarely depicted in movies set and shot here, even if the film is about\r\nthe poor and desperate underside of that city.  Young skateboard enthusiast Cisco (Jorge Lendeborg, Jr.) is\r\nflunking out of trade school, but he\u2019s got his sights set elsewhere, as do his\r\nthree similarly slack-seeming pals Junior, Patty Cake, and Boobie. (\u201cYou\u2019ve got\r\none more year to be a certified welder,\u201d a school counselor tells one, and he\r\nlooks as thrilled by the news as you would.) They are trying to break into\r\ntournament boarding, but the entry fees for even small-time events are beyond\r\nthe means of these poor kids. So they\u2019ve taken to boosting cars and selling\r\nthem to a tightwad chop-shop operator. It\u2019s dangerous business, and Cisco feels\r\nbad about it, largely for moral reasons. He\u2019s got a firsthand glimpse of what\r\nthe shadow side of life can do to a person, having lost his mom to a drug\r\noverdose. When he and his buddies find a stash of very high quality \u201cmolly\u201d in\r\nthe trunk of one car they steal, it\u2019s decision time. Cisco decides to sell off\r\nthe drugs.  I know what you\u2019re thinking: it\u2019s always stealing the wrong\r\ncar from the wrong person, who\u2019s always got a large amount of the wrong thing\r\nstashed in the car. And it\u2019s true: \u201cThe Land\u201d won\u2019t win any awards for\r\noriginality of premise. And the movie, after that premise comes into play,\r\ntends to meander more than a suspense story ought to. It meanders for the best\r\nreason, though, which is to help the viewer get to know the characters,\r\nincluding that of \u201cMomma,\u201d the drug queen who also has local renown as a food\r\ntruck entrepreneur, played by Linda Emond, the Tony-nominated actress who\u2019s also\r\na compelling feature of \u201cIndignation,\u201d also opening this week. Soundness of\r\nrationale notwithstanding, Caple doesn\u2019t always achieve his aim. Some folks in\r\nCisco\u2019s world do register strongly: his self-righteously sober quasi-stepdad,\r\nplayed by Kim Coates, and that fellow\u2019s streetwalker companion, a raw Erykah\r\nBadu. Michael K. Williams is his usual striking self as the father of one of\r\nCisco\u2019s crew. But other stuff fares less well, including the material\r\nconcerning the diminutive Junior; his character\u2019s bearing and circumstances\r\nmake him an instant clich\u00e9, despite actor Moises Aria\u2019s best efforts to bring\r\nhim to life.  Caple also has a tendency to show his influences on his\r\nsleeve, as with a shot from the point of view of the inside of a car trunk. But\r\nI\u2019m giving this movie a recommendation anyway, because the talent on display is\r\nnot insignificant, both in front of and behind the camera. And also because\r\nCaple brings his perhaps familiar narrative to an unexpected, and to my mind refreshing, conclusion. He\u2019s a filmmaker worth watching, here and in the future.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
