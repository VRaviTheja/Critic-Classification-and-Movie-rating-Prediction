{"Title": "The Armor of Light", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cThe Armor of Light\u201d begins with footage from a 1992 anti-abortion rally, in which one of the protest\u2019s leaders, a minister, is seen cradling a preserved human fetus in his hands. This gentleman, the Reverend Robert Schenck, happens to be the protagonist of the documentary.\u00a0 \n I\u2019ll put my cards on the table, for what it\u2019s worth. I\u2019m what some would call \u201cpro-choice\u201d and I am neither moved nor engaged by tactics such as the one used by Reverend Schenck. Regardless, one supposes that the footage does establish what some would call Schenck\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d credentials, and once the movie has done so, Schenck narrates an event that would change his life: the 1998 murder, or assassination if you please, of Dr. Bernard Slepian, an abortion provider who was killed by an anti-abortion activist. \u201cI was more than shocked, I was stunned,\u201d Schenck says, going on to say that he just couldn\u2019t believe that anyone \u201cpro-life\u201d would actually take a life. \u201cI was na\u00efve,\u201d he concludes. Gee, you think? Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it seems relatively clear that the rhetoric used by those from Schenck\u2019s camp is frequently on the heated-to-the-point-of-inflammatory side. There\u2019s not much hate-the-sin-love-the-sinner going on in this debate.\u00a0 Advertisement \n In any event, Schenck was genuinely moved, because he took a hard, detailed look at the gun culture within the wide-ranging evangelical community in the United States, and decided to \u2026 well, to question it. Schenck, as this documentary from co-directors Abigail Disney and Kathleen Hughes demonstrates, is not exactly an anti-gun crusader. Rather, he seeks to imbue a spirit of mindfulness to his flock. To just think about the potential contradictions within deeming oneself both \u201cpro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-gun.\u201d For merely suggesting such a thing, he gets a lot of pushback.\u00a0 \n Intersecting Schenck\u2019s story is that of Lucia McBeth, a flight attendant whose son was shot to death by Michael Dunn after a service-station conflict over music coming from the vehicle in which victim Jordan Davis sat. Davis was African-American, Dunn white. Dunn invoked Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws, which had recently served George Zimmerman so well, to justify his actions.\u00a0 \n So yes: this movie pokes its camera eye into about a dozen distinct forms of controversy. And yet \u201cThe Armor of Light\u201d is a calm, measured, and very visually attractive film (each and every shot that\u2019s not from archival or found footage is meticulously composed and executed; Disney & Hughes do NOT do \u201cB-roll\u201d), one that holds conclusions at arm\u2019s length.\u00a0 \n While drawing compelling portraits of Schenck, McBeth, and McBeth\u2019s family lawyer John Phillips, the movie also provides some peculiar glimpses into the aforementioned gun culture. Archival footage shows NRA head Wayne LaPierre proclaiming, \u201cThe only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.\u201d Later in the film, at a quiet meeting with fellow evangelicals (which opens with a prayer, even), an Operation Rescue member earnestly parrots those exact words to Schenck. It\u2019s like something out of \u201cThey Live,\u201d or Orwell. The same fellow also utters the catchphrase \u201cAn armed society is a polite society,\u201d and goes on to explain that two people who meet on the street who both know that the other is armed are not going to shoot each other, which begs the question of why they were going to shoot each other in the first place. In other scenes, several church-going folk discuss a fantasy scenario in which a child molester is luring a kid into a van but is stopped by a gun-toting parishioner. When has this ever happened, really? There\u2019s a tendency among some folks to try and bolster LaPierre\u2019s position by sending skeptics a blog post from Controversial Times, or some other highly reliable website, about the dozen or so times that a good guy with a gun HAS stopped a bad guy with a gun. I don\u2019t know what the actuarial tables make of this, given that the number of times this hasn\u2019t happened is well over a dozen but \u2026 oh, good grief.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Disney and Hughes' film, for all its evenhandedness of tone, is clearly in Schenck and particularly McBath\u2019s corner; it regards the conviction of Dunn as a triumph for common sense and justice. For all that, the film\u2019s calmness, and its roundabout approach to narrative\u2014somewhat unavoidable given the structure Disney & Hughes choose, which is to tell a lot of the story more or less as it happens rather than in retrospect\u2014diffuse some of its power. The overwhelming and slightly dispiriting (for this viewer, at least) note that \u201cThe Armor Of Light\u201d ends on is that the road ahead for Schenck is a long one, and the folks he wants to persuade along that road are not easily swayed from their reflexive disdain of a \u201cnanny state.\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}
