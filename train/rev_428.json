{"Title": "Take Care", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "If you\u2019re anything like me, every now and then you\u2019ll say to\r\nyourself, \u201cI wonder how the cast of the fizzled 2011 comedy \u2018A Good Old\r\nFashioned Orgy\u2019 is making out these days.\u201d And then an answer will come: Lake\r\nBell\u2019s almost-breakthrough cracking-the-glass-ceiling-of-voiceover-work epic\r\n\u201cIn A World,\u201d pretty creditable; Tyler Labine\u2019s enactment of a Larry The Cable\r\nGuy version of Seth Rogen\u2019s career, less commendable. And so on. And now word\r\ncomes from Leslie Bibb, the lissome, willowy member of the \u201cOrgy\u201d female\r\nensemble, also remembered as the butt of one or two not-at-all-misogynist jokes\r\nin the first two \u201cIron Man\u201d movies, with \u201cTake Care,\u201d a motion picture in which\r\nshe\u2019s required to lie on her back for most of the running time.  Advertisement Don\u2019t get too excited, fellas. Bibb\u2019s character, Frannie,\r\nhas been hit by a car, and much of her right side is braced up, and she must be\r\npractically supine for practically half a year. Resisting the entreaties of her\r\nbossy, old-school yuppie older sister\u2014so old school she\u2019s retreated with\r\nhusband and family to the suburbs\u2014Frannie insists on holing up in her\r\nfifth-floor apartment, right next door to a hunky guy who likes to work out to\r\nloud music, oh my. Said guy is played by Michael Stahl-David, who seems to be\r\nwanting to channel Bradley Cooper but keeps turning over Charlie Day instead.\r\nSuch oddities of performance are features that make \u201cTake Care\u201d \u2014written and\r\ndirected by Liz Trucillo, co-author of the BOOK \u201cHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You,\u201d\r\noh dear\u2014eccentrically watchable but not exactly good. Anyway.  One might think\r\nthat Frannie and Cooper-Day are destined for the romance this movie\u2019s setup requires,\r\nbut one would be wrong. In the midst of Frannie\u2019s whingeing and\r\nnear-sociopathic passive aggressive demands, and Cooper-Day\u2019s Contemporary\r\nUrban Philosophy Musings\u2014\u201cWhen somebody asks me to do them a favor it\u2019s like\r\nthey\u2019re squeezing the air out of my lungs,\u201d OK buddy\u2014we learn of a backstory.\r\nFrannie has an ex: Devon, or as he\u2019s referred to early on \u201cDevil,\u201d who\u2019s just\r\nmade some kind of massive business deal (although the figure bandied about, $6\r\nmillion, seems a little low for my own expensive tastes, frankly) and who\r\napparently owes Frannie big time because she nursed him back to health some\r\ntime prior to their breakup. Frannie lures Devon (Thomas Sadoski, trying so\r\nhard to underplay \u201cfinance professional\u201d that he barely registers, really) to\r\nvisit her and demands payback in the form of male nursing. This doesn\u2019t sit\r\nwell with Jodi (Betti Gilpin), Devon\u2019s grasping and possibly lunatic\r\ngirlfriend. Some form of attempted hilarity, of course, ensues.  The dramatis personae hews closely to the standards attached\r\nto the ostensible ultra-female-centric rom-com as defined by \u201cSex And The City\u201d\r\n(a series for which Trucillo penned an episode)\u2014gay best friend, a couple of\r\nnon-white characters whose presence practically screams \u201cI\u2019m NOT an\r\nafterthought, honest!\u201d \u2014and so on. What exerts an odd fascination here is that\r\neach character heartily embodies a different variety of solipsistic creep; you\r\nstart feeling sorry for the creators of the movie for having to live among such\r\nawful people. Then it dawns on you that the film\u2019s creators don\u2019t find these\r\npeople awful at all \u2014they find them normal. Terrifying, really.  \u201cTake Care\u201d moves briskly to its entirely predictable but\r\nnonetheless bizarre denouement, in which the heroine happily concludes that She\r\nDoesn\u2019t Need That Guy Anyway, and then, of course, bags him. (Sorry, is that a\r\nspoiler?) It\u2019s a peculiar journey, and Bibb is an appealing enough screen\r\npresence that she makes it less philosophically and aesthetically objectionable\r\nthan it might have been had she not been in it, but it\u2019s ultimately more of\r\nanthropological interest than aesthetic.
