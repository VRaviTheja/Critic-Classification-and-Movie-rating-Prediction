{"Title": "Winter Sleep", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Turkish filmmaker Nuri Blige Ceylan is undeniably a\r\nworld-class filmmaker, but he does not, as they say, crush it every time up. To\r\ngo back a few films, his 2006 \u201cClimates\u201d was a moody and mordantly funny\r\nrelationship sulk; his 2008 domestic drama \u201cThree Monkeys\u201d was too impressed by\r\nits allegorical leanings; his 2011 \u201cOnce Upon A Time In Anatolia,\u201d while searing, also felt a little\r\ntoo self-consciously ambitious. The running time of his new picture \u201cWinter\r\nSleep,\u201d three hours and change, suggests a similar weight, but at it happens,\r\nthis movie struck me as both Ceylan\u2019s plainest, and perhaps his finest.\u00a0 Advertisement On its\r\nsurface, \u201cWinter Sleep\u201d seems to partake, if not indulge, a familiar European\r\nart-film staple, placing a male protagonist in various forms of\r\nisolation/alienation from relatives and friends as he and they discuss burning\r\nissues of philosophy and emotion. Ceylan invokes/evokes Chekhov in his\r\nscenario: protagonist Aydin, an aging former theatrical actor, runs a hotel in\r\na picturesque section of Anatolia and desultorily deals with surly tenants on\r\nsome land he owns, a disenchanted (and much younger) wife, a watchful sister,\r\nand various others, revealing the discontents at the roots of all their\r\nrelationship and a deep dissatisfaction with life itself, despite the prestige\r\nand autonomy and leisure that Aydin enjoys.  The movie, which won the Palme d\u2019Or at this year\u2019s Cannes\r\nFilm Festival, has been disparaged by some skeptical critics as a gabfest, and\r\nit\u2019s true, there\u2019s a lot of talk here, and very little of it\u2019s small. But\r\nthat\u2019s not to say that the film is glacially paced; even when staying in the\r\nsame settings, Ceylan\u2019s camerawork and editing are terrifically alert. The\r\ntalk, for all its abstractions, gradually lays bare the poor regard with which\r\nmost of the characters hold each other, and, at about the halfway point, when\r\nAydin (played with glum tenacity by Haluk Bilginer) calls his put-upon spouse\r\n(Melisa S\u00f6zen) a \u201cbored neurotic,\u201d the fur really begins to fly. Not much of\r\nwhat is said by these characters is particularly novel or earth-shaking it\u2019s\r\ntrue, but I think that\u2019s central to what Ceylan is doing here. This is a work\r\nof cinema, not theater or prose, and what counts most in \u201cWinter Sleep,\u201d to me\r\nat least, is not the commonplace sentiments of dysfunction and dread, but\r\nspaces between the words. The accumulation of images imbues the film with a\r\nkind of bleak coziness that brings to life the accusation that Aydin\u2019s sister\r\nNecia (Demet Akbag) levels at him: \u201cIn order not to suffer, you prefer to fool\r\nyourself.\u201d The strength of \u201cWinter Sleep\u201d is not so much in what any of\r\nthe characters say as much as what it needs its near-monumental length to\r\nactually show: which is the way the most seemingly banal circumstances can\r\nthrow you into a dark night of the soul before you even know what\u2019s going on, a\r\nstate of wide-awake despair so calamitous one has no choice but to make a\r\ncompanion of it. That sounds like a paradoxical state\u2014and it is, a painfully\r\nparadoxical one, but it\u2019s a real one, and the signal accomplishment of \u201cWinter\r\nSleep\u201d is that Ceylan\u2019s empathy and technical facility make it palpable in the\r\nartistic realm. It\u2019s a daunting achievement and in a strange way also a\r\ncomfort. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
