{"Title": "A Letter to Momo", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "As is so often the case in Japanese animation, displacement\r\nand emotional upheaval lead to interaction with the supernatural in the\r\ndelicate and effective \u201cA Letter to Momo,\u201d finally opening stateside today and\r\nexpanding over the next month after years building buzz on the festival circuit\r\n(it played TIFF in 2011) and even longer in its detailed, hand-drawn\r\nproduction. Writer/director Hiroyuki Okiura last made waves over a decade ago\r\nwith \u201cJin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade\u201d but this complex, delicate project took seven\r\nyears to make and a surprisingly long time to work its way through the\r\ninternational film market to U.S. theaters. With the recent announcement that\r\nStudio Ghibli may no longer be creating its own films after the retirement of Hayao Miyazaki and will move on to merely manage its impressive\r\nand influential library, fans of this kind of animated storytelling have high\r\nhopes for \u201cMomo.\u201d Those expectations are mostly fulfilled thanks to a deep\r\nemotional understanding of grief on Okiura\u2019s part and the captivating visuals\r\nthat accompany the story of a girl who needs some otherworldly help when she\u2019s\r\nforced to grow up far too quickly. Advertisement Momo Miyaura is the Alice of this adventure into Wonderland,\r\nan 11-year-old girl forced to relocate with her mother after the passing of her\r\nfather. Momo and her asthmatic mother move back to mom\u2019s childhood home, an\r\nisolated island named Shio, far from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo in which\r\nMomo was raised. Momo doesn\u2019t fit in. She\u2019s too frightened to jump in the water\r\nwith the other local kids. She clutches the letter from her father that he was\r\nplanning to write just before he died that says merely, \u201cDear Momo\u2026\u201d What did\r\nhe want to say to her in his final moments? Will Momo ever know? Or will she be\r\nable to stop obsessing over past thoughts unexpressed? Into this emotional upheaval drops three imps from the \u201cAbove\u201d\u2014Kawa,\r\nMame and Iwa. Momo is not supposed to be able to see this memorably designed\r\ncreatures but she can and they become something of a support structure for a\r\ngirl dealing with the unimaginable grief of losing a parent. She essentially\r\ntraps them in this world, holding the totem that keeps them here instead of\r\nreturning to the other side. Giving an 11-year-old control over passage between\r\nthis world and the next after something as uncontrollable as a father\u2019s death\r\nmakes for a beautifully connected film on a spiritual level. Overall, Okiura\r\nstays very focused on Momo\u2019s emotional journey, which is smart. It\u2019s not as\r\nfantastical as \u201cSpirited Away\u201d or many other films about children who encounter\r\nthe supernatural upon being forced to deal with death, as Momo always stays front and center. The final moments of her journey out of despair are powerfully emotional. In fact, \u201cA Letter to Momo\u201d is more playful than magical.\r\nThe differentiation in exaggerated design between the three imps that befriend Momo is remarkably\r\neffective and their actions are, as is common with magical creatures in\r\nJapanese animation, downright childish at times. Kawa fends off a wild boar\r\nwith a magical fart in slow-motion; the kind of moment that would probably earn\r\na film like this critical scorn for gross-out humor were it in a DreamWorks\r\nfilm but works in the fabric of this piece overall. They dance, lick Momo\u2019s leg\r\nfor attention, eat like slobs\u2014they\u2019re designed in such a way that they seem\r\nmore childish than Momo, which is essential to her journey to adulthood through\r\ngrief.  There are times where one feels the two-hour length of \u201cA\r\nLetter to Momo,\u201d especially in the over-long first act\u2014it takes almost half an\r\nhour for Momo to interact with the imps that will become the backbone of the story.\r\nEven scenes that work, such as a climax on a rain-soaked bridge, feel like they\r\ncould have been trimmed by a few hand-drawn frames. Maybe then it wouldn\u2019t have\r\ntaken so long for a film this sweet, delicate, and fun to get to U.S.\r\naudiences. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
