{"Title": "Manglehorn", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "David Gordon Green continues to focus on character studies,\r\nas he did with \u201cPrince Avalanche\u201d and \u201cJoe,\u201d but the results this time are decidedly\r\nmore frustrating than those superior efforts. Just as \u201cJoe\u201d often felt like a vehicle\r\nto rehabilitate the oft-mocked career of Nicolas Cage in the last decade or so,\r\n\u201cManglehorn\u201d sometimes feels designed to remind us that Al Pacino is still one\r\nof our greatest actors. OK. Point taken. Now what? While \u201cJoe\u201d built an\r\ninteresting film around Cage\u2019s performance, Green leaves Pacino adrift in \u201cManglehorn,\u201d\r\nand the result is a disappointing, shambling piece of melancholy with a few\r\ninteresting scenes here and there that never cohere in such a way that allows the legendary actor to disappear into the character. Advertisement Pacino plays an eccentric locksmith named Manglehorn who lives in a small Texas town by himself. He\u2019s estranged from his financially successful son Jacob\r\n(Chris Messina), has few real friends outside of his cat, and writes letters to\r\nthe love of his life who got away many years ago. A highlight of his meager existence seems\r\nto be the occasional visit to the local bank to see the lovely teller Dawn\r\n(Holly Hunter), but when he\u2019s given a chance to turn that into something\r\ngreater, he fumbles. Manglehorn has allowed anger, regret and depression to push him into isolation in his later years. He doesn\u2019t have\r\nmuch left outside of his key-making business, and that basically just gives him\r\nanother reason to be alone in his shop.  On one level, Paul Logan\u2019s script is defiantly episodic:\r\nManglehorn talks to his son, he runs into an acquaintance (played in a\r\nremarkably aggravating style by Harmony Korine), he flirts with Holly Hunter,\r\netc. While \u201cManglehorn\u201d could have been a character study, a slice of reclusive\r\nold age in modern America, Logan and Green layer their film with poetic\r\nself-importance, mostly in Manglehorn\u2019s letters and inner monologues, complete\r\nwith lines like \u201cI\u2019m losing hope in tomorrow.\u201d\r\nIt feels false, like a degree of self-understanding that only comes in motion\r\npictures or bad fiction. And that dishonesty carries over to scenes between\r\nManglehorn and his son, especially a dinner between the two that\u2019s just too\r\npoorly written for Pacino and Messina to save it. Every shot of Manglehorn\u2019s grizzled face is weighted with\r\nunearned gravitas, the kind that comes with designing a film around an\r\nactor instead of a character or a narrative. It feels like the first draft was\r\ncalled \u201cAl Pacino is Still a Hell of an Actor.\u201d And that showcase is constantly\r\npushing against the film\u2019s realism. There\u2019s a scene late in the film between\r\nPacino and Hunter that really should work\u2014she\u2019s great in it\u2014in which Dawn\r\nrealizes that Manglehorn\u2019s enclosed life is one that she may not want to enter,\r\nbut Pacino and Green can\u2019t figure out how to play the moment. Pacino practically\r\nclimbs on a soapbox to deliver a monologue, when it should be about a man\r\nafraid and tentative to re-enter the real world of human relationships. At its best, \u201cManglehorn\u201d is a surprisingly deep conversation\r\nwith an old friend on a twilight Southern evening. It\u2019s about those times in\r\nour lives when we reassess past mistakes and consider the diminishing hours we\r\nhave left on this planet. I only wish the film allowed that conversation to\r\nflow naturally with a well-rounded character instead of reminding us over and over again that we\u2019re\r\ntalking to the one and only Al Pacino.
