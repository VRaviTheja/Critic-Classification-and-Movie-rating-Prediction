{"Title": "Jack Reacher: Never Go Back", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) isn\u2019t a talky fellow. He\u2019s a loner with no middle name and no fixed address. He lives in fleabag motels, gets around by hitchhiking, and tends to communicate with his fists, though only after repeated warnings have failed. He is not, to put it mildly, father or husband material.  So of course \u201cJack Reacher: Never Go Back,\u201d based on Lee Child\u2019s novel, has the bright idea of outfitting Jack with a makeshift nuclear family consisting of a female Army major, Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders), who\u2019s had a bloody conspiracy wrongly pinned on her, and a teenage girl named Samantha Dayton (Danika Yarosh), who might or might not be Jack\u2019s daughter by a previous dalliance. This is the kind of setup that Clint Eastwood might\u2019ve handled with aplomb back in the day\u2014in fact, Eastwood\u2019s early masterpiece \u201cThe Outlaw Josey Wales,\u201d tells a thematically similar story about a loner who acquires a \"family\"\u2014and although Cruise is diminutive compared to Eastwood, he does a credible version of Clint\u2019s squint and hair-trigger lethality. His performance tries to delve deeper than the film will allow. We get a sense, more from watching Cruise than from any of the forgettable dialogue the character\u2019s been given, that Jack inflicts violence because it\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s really good at; that it may in fact be his only form of cowardice\u2014a means of running away from adult responsibilities\u2014and that he has no idea what to say to a romantic partner or a child during quiet moments.  Advertisement It\u2019s a pity that \u201cJack Reacher: Never Go Back\u201d fails to support Cruise and his co-stars, all of whom are acting as if their lives depended on it. There\u2019s a great movie buried somewhere in here\u2014a strange but beguiling family comedy and a meditation on nature vs. nurture, with a bit of shooting and punching thrown in\u2014but the filmmakers never figure out how to excavate it. There\u2019s a touch of 1980s Hong Kong action cinema in the way that director Edward Zwick and his co-writer Marshall Herskovitz (rewriting Richard Wenk\u2019s script) juxtapose bone-breaking fisticuffs with deadpan-goofy scenes where Jack and Susan\u2014who\u2019s basically a female Jack, with the same anger-flexing jawline\u2014struggle to protect and half-assedly parent Samantha as the trio runs from city to city, fending off assassins and trying to clear Susan\u2019s name. But Zwick doesn\u2019t have the Hong Kong wildness required to pull off that kind of film. He\u2019s an intelligent director, but too earnest and careful for material like this. There are a handful of genuinely funny moments in which Jack, Susan and Samantha\u2014a street-tough kid whose mom was a prostitute and drug addict\u2014fall into the familiar \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d patterns even though they\u2019re holed up in a New Orleans hotel while trying to get to the bottom of an Afghanistan-based arms smuggling operation run by a Halliburton-type military contractor. None of them have experience behaving within a traditional mother-father-child configuration, so they\u2019re a bit like actors who\u2019ve been thrown into a play without benefit of having read the script and are forced to improvise, badly. Susan and Samantha\u2019s version of mother-daughter bonding includes a tutorial on how to wrench a gun from a man\u2019s hands and kick him in the testicles. When Samantha sneaks out without permission one night, Jack and Susan confront her when she returns, and Jack half-sputters, \u201cWhere were you?\u201d The sight of two skull-cracking soldiers failing to control a teenage girl is a good joke, and remarkably, it never gets old. Unfortunately, it never becomes something other than a joke, or an undeveloped notion. The movie is filled with undeveloped notions, as well as scenes that might\u2019ve been dazzling, or at least clever, if Zwick and Herskovitz had been able to settle on a tone and a vision and develop them. Instead they march along with mild enthusiasm but no gusto, alternating dry-but-not-dry-enough comedy with action scenes that are competently executed but nowhere near as inventive and stirringly perverse as the best stuff in the original \u201cJack Reacher,\u201d a likewise pretty-good military conspiracy thriller enlivened by Cruise\u2019s junkyard dog sourness, a campy villain performance by Werner Herzog (who has no equivalent here, alas), and a couple of brilliantly staged, close-quarters fights.  Advertisement Zwick (who has told many military-themed stories, including \u201cCourage Under Fire\u201d and \u201cGlory\u201d) and Herskovitz (who teamed with Zwick on a series of great domestic dramas for TV, the best of which was \u201cMy So-Called Life\u201d) can\u2019t seem to decide if they want to lightly parody the subgenre of \u201cburned-out killer rejuvenated by love\u201d or embrace it without apology, even if it means alienating fanboys who are uncomfortable with any display of emotion that doesn\u2019t involve Cap and Bucky. This confusion manifests itself in the film\u2019s penultimate scene, a fated goodbye between Jack and Samantha that might\u2019ve been heartbreaking had the filmmakers ended it thirty seconds earlier.  Cruise does some of his career-best acting in this scene; you can see Jack struggling to make his face and voice do what any natural father\u2019s would do automatically, and failing miserably, because he\u2019s either not wired that way or lacks the life experience required to fake it. There are moments where Cruise\u2019s work here evokes Kurt Russell in \u201cSoldier,\u201d which is one of the best lead performances I\u2019ve seen in a movie that was just barely OK. There\u2019s fine supporting work by Aldis Hodge as a military police officer, Holt McCallany as an officer who\u2019s up to no good, and Patrick Heusinger as an assassin who\u2019s known only as The Hunter, and whose black trenchcoats and hipster facial hair suggest a Eurotrash cousin of Ryan Gosling. Smulders has a number of strong moments, too\u2014and she drives home the idea of Susan as a female Jack by delivering stinging rebukes in a very Cruise-y \u201cA Few Good Men\u201d cadence\u2014but she, too, is left to wander between the winds. There is nothing terrible about this film, yet it fails everyone involved with it. That\u2019s the kind of magic trick that you don\u2019t want to see.", "Critic": "Delta"}
