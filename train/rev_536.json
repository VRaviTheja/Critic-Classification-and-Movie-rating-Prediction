{"Title": "Proxy", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Zack Parker\u2019s \"Proxy\" opens with a scene so inherently shocking that \r\nit required a special warning in the program when the film played at the\r\n Toronto Film Festival for its \"deeply disturbing content.\" A quiet \r\nwoman named Esther (Alexia Rasmussen) is walking home from her final \r\nultrasound before giving birth. She\u2019s very pregnant, close to nine \r\nmonths. With no warning, a hooded attacker knocks her unconscious and \r\npounds her stomach with a brick, killing the baby. It is the kind of \r\nstomach-churning scene that sends those who just casually see whatever \r\nis playing at their local arthouse that weekend fleeing for the door. \r\n(Trust me, I used to work at such a theater and you would be amazed at \r\nthe number of people who just see whatever is playing.)  Advertisement And yet, while \r\nseasoned filmgoers expect what follows to be a procedural investigation \r\nor motive-detailing explanation of such a horrific event, Parker takes \r\nhis film somewhere else entirely. With the blunt force and social \r\ncontext of creators like Chuck Palahniuk (known in cinematic circles for\r\n \"Fight Club\" and \"Choke,\" but this piece is closer to his fiction like \r\n\"Survivor\" or the stories of \"Haunted\") and Lucky McKee (\"May\", \"The \r\nWoman\"), Parker has made a tough, brutal, and often riveting thriller. At first, it seems like Esther is understandably unmoored by the \r\nmurder of her unborn baby and that \"Proxy\" will be a dramatic piece \r\nabout unimaginable grief. She stares off into space, rides the bus to \r\nthe hospital in the middle of the night, and seems to have no human \r\nconnection at all. Then she meets Melanie (a truly great turn from Alexa\r\n Havins), a kind soul at a local support group. Melanie and Esther \r\nbecome quick friends, maybe even more, but there\u2019s something as \"off\" \r\nabout Melanie as there is in our heroine. Parker maintains an uneasy, \r\nunsettling tone even in this first act in the way that he crafts long, \r\nalmost intentionally clunky scenes of dialogue between his protagonists \r\nthat ooze with the tension of audience expectation. We\u2019ve seen a \r\npregnant woman attacked. What\u2019s next? And the flat, disaffected \r\nmannerisms of his stars add to the tension. Something is clearly wrong \r\nwith Esther. Something is clearly wrong with Melanie. Parker plays with \r\nour anticipation for these character reveals brilliantly. And then he drops the floor out from under us. More than once. To \r\ngive away where \"Proxy\" goes would be to spoil the unsettling appeal of a\r\n film that continuously foreshadows awful events to come but still \r\nsomehow ends up in unexpected places. Two significant others enter the \r\npicture in the form of Esther\u2019s girlfriend Anika (Kristina Klebe) and \r\nMelanie\u2019s husband Patrick (filmmaker Joe Swanberg). Minor roles are \r\nfilled out by performers who seem intentionally inexperienced, adding to\r\n the unease throughout the entire, admittedly long film. The amateurish \r\naspects of the production don\u2019t detract from it as much as give it an \r\neerie, lived-in quality that makes it harder to shake, not unlike some \r\nof the early works of David Cronenberg, another filmmaker who loved to \r\nplumb the horrific depths of everyday life. Parker writes very casual \r\ndialogue and doesn\u2019t fussily edit his film, allowing the horror to arise\r\n from or shatter the mundane. He can sometimes take a beat or two too \r\nlong and there\u2019s a probably tighter version of \"Proxy\" that\u2019s about 20 \r\nminutes shorter, but Parker still finds ways to sustain the unease. Advertisement There\u2019s a whole branch of thriller/horror literature and film that \r\nworks to keep those engaged with it guessing as to where it\u2019s going, but\r\n most of it seems random or haphazard in its structure. \"Proxy\" never \r\ndoes. It\u2019s a film that opens with the death of a baby and yet that isn\u2019t\r\n really even what it ends up being about (even if everything that \r\nfollows wouldn\u2019t without that incident). It\u2019s a film that I kept trying \r\nto get ahead of\u2014THIS is what it\u2019s \"about,\" where it\u2019s going, what the \r\ntitle means, etc.\u2014but Parker kept going left when I expected him to go \r\nright. It\u2019s a daring, confident, absolutely brutal film that takes no \r\nprisoners. It\u2019s the kind of film that will likely be loathsome to those \r\nmorally unwilling to not only accept its descent into darkness but also \r\naccept that the darkness that makes it so riveting is based on human \r\nneed.", "Critic": "Beta"}
