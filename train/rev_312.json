{"Title": "Vice", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "See that lost, uncertain look in Thomas Jane\u2019s eyes in that\r\npicture above? It\u2019s there in every scene in \u201cVice,\u201d almost to the degree that I\r\nthink he\u2019s winking at the audience at times\u2014Yes,\r\nI know this is B-movie junk, but I needed the paycheck. Just go with it.\r\nThe problem with \u201cVice\u201d is that it can\u2019t even fulfill those low, for-the-money,\r\npure escapism expectations. It\u2019s one of those nearly straight-to-VOD pieces\r\nthat fluctuates between boring and offensive, never rising above either\r\nadjective. Some will dismiss it by saying it\u2019s so ineffective as to never\r\nreally aggravate critical faculties, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a complete\r\nwaste of time and talent as well. Advertisement In a not-too-distant future, the elite have access to a\r\nvirtual reality playground that allows them to live out their wildest fantasies\r\nwith \u201cBlade Runner\u201d-esque androids who look and behave exactly like real\r\npeople. Always wanted to rob a bank and shoot your way out of the ensuing\r\nconflict? Go to Vice, run by the above-the-law Julian (Bruce Willis). Of\r\ncourse, as in all Hollywood condemnations of violent video game culture (which\r\nis what this is at its core), the violence of this fantasy world bleeds out\r\ninto the real world, making problems for tough-as-nails cop Roy (Jane). The\r\npaper-thin idea being that if people are allowed to give into their wildest\r\nfantasies, they won\u2019t be able to distinguish between them and reality. And so\r\nthe people who get ultra-violent in the world of Vice continue that in Roy\u2019s\r\ndistrict, leading him to target Julian as public enemy #1. Meanwhile, Kelly (Ambyr Childers, so great in the underrated\r\n\u201cWe Are What We Are\u201d), a replicant in the world of Vice who goes through every\r\nday thinking that\u2019s a special one and usually ends up killed, has become\r\nself-aware. Without warning, her system malfunctions, and she\u2019s overloaded with\r\nmemories she shouldn\u2019t have. Self-aware, she goes on the run, even tracking\r\ndown her creator and helping Roy topple the corrupt adult playground of Vice. If it sounds familiar, it should. Borrowing liberally from\r\nclassics like \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and dozens of quasi-sci-fi non-classics like \u201cVirtuosity,\u201d \u201cVice\u201d feels\r\nas artificially replicated as the androids in its narrative. Judged\r\nsuperficially, \u201cVice\u201d does nothing that hasn\u2019t been done before with more style\r\nand substance. The movie is visually dull even when judged against its\r\nlow-budget, essentially straight-to-VOD brethren. Most people don\u2019t come to\r\nmovies like \u201cVice\u201d for complex visual storytelling, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\r\nshould excuse cheap sets, dull framing and other signs of lazy filmmaking. Even if it didn\u2019t work as art or escapism, \u201cVice\u201d wastes an\r\nopportunity for social commentary as well. Roy is a non-character, almost so\r\ninconsequential to the storyline that poor Jane doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s been\r\ndirected to do anything in the climactic scenes. Even the director\r\nrealized they didn\u2019t need him. Worst of all, \u201cVice\u201d is about giving personality\r\nand life to an android female who has been created as a plaything for men to\r\nabuse and behave with without repercussions. And yet turning Kelly self-aware\r\ndoesn\u2019t make her confident and driven. It sends her back into the arms of her\r\nmale creator, turning her into a damsel-in-distress who can only be saved by a\r\nman. That\u2019s a bad B-movie concept of identity. And by the time director Brian\r\nA. Miller finally gives Kelly something to do, it\u2019s in the most generic \u201ctough\r\naction movie chick\u201d way possible. The talented Childers deserves so much\r\nbetter. Heck, so does Thomas Jane. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
