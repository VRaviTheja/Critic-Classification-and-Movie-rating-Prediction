{"Title": "Final Portrait", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The writer James Lord was a chronicler of 20th\u00a0century art who not infrequently befriended the artists he wrote about. In 1964, in Paris, the sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti asked Lord to sit for a portrait. What the artist had originally pitched as a day\u2019s work wound up taking almost three weeks. Not an eternity by any stretch of the imagination, but an inconvenience, and a meaty experience, one out of which Lord forged a memoir entitled \u201cA Giacometti Portrait.\u201d \u201cFinal Portrait\u201d is\u00a0an adaptation of that memoir written and directed by Stanley Tucci. Like a couple of other directorial efforts from Tucci, who\u2019s primarily known as an actor, this is a picture about process. His 1996 \u201cBig Night\u201d is the story of the making of an epic meal; 2000\u2019s \u201cJoe Gould\u2019s Secret\u201d is a dual portrait of two writers with very different approaches to work (and very different results).    Advertisement Giacometti, a self-described \u201cItalian Swiss\u201d now ensconced in a ramshackle mini-compound containing studio and living quarters in Paris, is played with shambolic gruffness by Geoffrey Rush. Armie Hammer\u2019s straight-standing, composed James Lord seems the artist\u2019s polar opposite, but the two have a kinship\u2014Lord has a deep understanding of Giacometti\u2019s artistic language.    Still, the artist\u2019s relentless self-doubt puzzles Lord. Lord protests that Giacometti\u2019s success ought to have erased that. Quite the contrary, the artist observes: \u201cWhat better breeding ground for self-doubt than success?\u201d The trappings of success mean little to him, either. He makes millions of francs in sales, but almost literally throws it away; what he doesn\u2019t, he hides in various nook of his studio.    As Alberto begins, erases, and again begins the portrait, James interrogates not just the artist but his brother and assistant Diego (Tony Shalhoub), his dutiful, very drawn-looking wife Annette (Sylvie Testud). Another presence is Caroline (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy), a local prostitute with whom the artist is highly invested, to the point of buying her a sporty new BMW.    The movie is a minimally lovely treat to look at. Tucci and cinematographer Danny Cohen desaturate the colors at the beginning, giving the movie a black-and-slate-gray look from which blues and reds try to fight their way into the viewer\u2019s perception. The evening scenes, many of them spent at Giacometti\u2019s local, Caf\u00e9 Adrien, have a golden warmth. The mobile camera, which on occasion becomes a trifle too shaky, negotiates the artist\u2019s studio with a crafty curiosity.    This movie is a chamber piece, and even at its modest 90-minute running time, it gets a trifle repetitious\u2014Alberto picks up the brush again, James sits down, the camera produces a series of extreme close-ups of James\u2019 face (it\u2019s the head that the artist has the most trouble with). It\u2019s a nice face, with excellent pores, but, you know. Still, the depictions of artistic struggle and mania, the communication of the artist\u2019s frequently painful bubble, are insightful and rewarding. The warts-and-all depiction of Giacometti, which establishes a credible explanation if not excuse for the many selfish acts he\u2019s seen doing, winds up being an apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.\u00a0  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
