{"Title": "A Good Marriage", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "What is it about Stephen King\u2019s novels and short stories\r\nthat so often make their transition to the screen rocky, to say the least? Even\r\nwhen he adapts, as he does with \u201cA Good Marriage,\u201d starring Joan Allen and\r\nAnthony LaPaglia, the resulting product regularly fails to capture the breadth\r\nof his gifts as a storyteller. Perhaps it\u2019s because so many of King\u2019s best\r\nnarratives involve something easier to relate to in the form of the written\r\nword than recreated on film: the horror behind the picket fence. Little is\r\nscarier than the realization that your husband (\u201cThe Shining\u201d), rescuer (\u201cMisery\u201d),\r\ncar (\u201cChristine\u201d) or even family pet (\u201cCujo\u201d) are not what they seem. And yet\r\nthat same identifiable horror in his fiction often falls flat in film. Flat is\r\nthe kindest way to describe \u201cA Good Marriage,\u201d a King novella turned feature\r\nthat could have worked as a short or an episode of \u201cMasters of Horror\u201d but\r\ntruly tests viewer patience at 102 minutes. It\u2019s arguably the dullest King film\r\nyet, despite solid work by LaPaglia to save it and a decent set-up that goes\r\nabsolutely nowhere. Advertisement I remember seeing George Sluizer\u2019s \u201cThe Vanishing\u201d at a\r\nyoung enough age to be disturbed not just by its legendary ending but by the\r\nvery concept that a madman could also be a family man. Wait, not all serial\r\nkillers are drooling maniacs? I might be living next door to one? And he might\r\nhave a wife? And kids?!?!?! How is that possible? King reportedly was inspired\r\nby the fact that The BTK Killer had a wife, who dealt with a lot of negative\r\npress when his binding/torturing/killing came to light. How could she not have\r\nknown? He reimagines BTK as \u201cBeadie,\u201d a man who has killed a dozen\r\nyoung women in Maine. After Bob (LaPaglia) goes out of town on another\r\ncollectible coin-hunting mission tied in with work, longtime wife Darcy (Allen)\r\nhappens upon a BDSM magazine in the garage. She digs a little deeper, and she\r\nfinds a box with driver\u2019s licenses of the dead girls. She starts putting it\r\ntogether. Bob is Beadie. What will she do? Will she confront him? How will she\r\nprotect her three kids from the pain sure to come? \u201cA Good Marriage,\u201d at its best, should be a war of wills\r\nbetween a maniac and the wife who just learned she has loved a maniac. And yet this\r\nwar is surprisingly, even shockingly dull. It's filmed like a TV movie, with the central setting of Bob & Darcy's house feeling bizarrely like a set. Nothing in this world is lived in. There are no stakes. There's no reason to care.  Part of the problem is both in the\r\nway Darcy is crafted in the screenplay and the choices made by Allen in\r\npresenting her. This Darcy is cold, and almost callous at times. I simply never\r\nbelieved her dilemma. And if that\u2019s true, all of \u201cA Good Marriage\u201d falls apart.\r\nLaPaglia does better work, almost finding a dark current of Coen-esque black\r\ncomedy in the coin-collecting lunatic. And that right there is a big problem\u2014when\r\nyou find the BTK Killer more interesting than the wife who you need to root for\r\nin her efforts to stop him.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
