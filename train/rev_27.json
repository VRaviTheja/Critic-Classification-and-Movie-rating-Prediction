{"Title": "Queen of Katwe", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Director Mira Nair introduced her thoroughly crowdpleasing \u201cQueen\r\nof Katwe\u201d on Saturday night at the Toronto International Film Festival by quoting the slogan\r\nof a film school she has founded in Uganda, where she lives: \u201cIf we don\u2019t tell\r\nour own stories, no one will.\u201d That sense of ownership and authorship permeates \u201cQueen of Katwe,\u201d elevating it above your average feel-good biopic and allowing\r\nits message to feel not only inspirational but genuine. The story of Phiona\r\nMutesi is a fascinating one on its own, but what could have just been an\r\nextended \u201c30 For 30\u201d feels lived-in, compassionate and truthful. It helps\r\ngreatly to have not only Nair\u2019s clear love for her country guiding every\r\ndecision but also the amazing depth of David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong\u2019o to\r\nground it from most of its sentimental clich\u00e9s. Some of the dialogue in the\r\nfinal act feels a little false and manipulative, but those scenes stand out because it\u2019s been so believable up to that point.\u00a0 Advertisement The nuanced, subtle newcomer Madina Nalwanga plays\r\n10-year-old Phiona Mutesi, a young lady who lives in the slum of Katwe in\r\nKampala, Uganda. She has almost no possessions, can\u2019t read and sells maize in\r\nthe street to try to scrape together change for her family, which includes two\r\nbrothers, a sister, and her headstrong mother Harriet (Nyong\u2019o). Phiona and her\r\noldest brother Brian (Martin Kabanza) cross paths with a local sports ministry head named\r\nRobert Katende (Oyelowo). Recognizing that the slum kids he\u2019s working with\r\naren\u2019t going to compete at football, he decides to teach them something he\r\nmastered at a young age, the art of chess. It\u2019s a game that equalizes issues of\r\nclass, education and income. It can be played by anyone in the world, and\r\nKatende soon realizes that this young girl from Katwe has a special gift,\r\nespecially when she starts beating him. It\u2019s to be expected that the education segments of \u201cQueen of\r\nKatwe\u201d include a number of nods to how the game reflects Phiona\u2019s life, but\r\nthe execution doesn't feel heavy-handed. Nair is confident enough in her characters and\r\nthe story she\u2019s telling to avoid the pitfalls of repetitive lessons. So we get\r\nthe idea that Phiona likes the act of \u201cQueening\u201d because a pawn makes it all\r\nthe way across the board, against all odds, and becomes a Queen. We don\u2019t\r\nhear it 15 times like we would in a lesser film. When Katende explains the idea\r\nof finding a \u201csafe space\u201d whenever your opponent is on the offensive, it\u2019s easy to\r\ntranslate that to Phiona\u2019s real life but the movie doesn\u2019t hammer it in. This\r\nsubtle touch is undermined a bit in the final act as issues of Phiona\u2019s success\r\nand class conflicts start to tear the family apart in a way that feels manipulative\r\nand melodramatic, but Nair recovers by the end. Two of the reasons she manages to get the film back from the\r\nedge of treacle are right there in David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong\u2019o. The \u201cSelma\u201d\r\nstar is as charismatic as ever, capturing the kindness of a man who saw a\r\npotential escape for a young lady and did whatever he could to make it happen.\r\nOyelowo\u2019s work here is subtle but so consistent. He never looks like he\u2019s\r\nworking the message of the film more than the character he\u2019s playing. Opposite\r\nhim, Nyong\u2019o is phenomenal. She has an incredible ability to convey backstory.\r\nWe believe Harriet isn\u2019t merely a sounding board for our heroine or an\r\nemotional plot device. She feels real because of the intense passion that Nyong\u2019o\r\nbrings to her. And it\u2019s in the subtle things, like a glance that conveys fear about her family\u2019s future or the different tone she takes with each of her\r\nchildren. One also shouldn\u2019t miss how good Nalwanga is here, giving a fluid and physical performance. Advertisement Of course, much of the credit should go back to Nair and her\r\ntechnical team, who capture the streets of Uganda in a way we haven\u2019t really\r\nseen before, certainly not in a Disney film (Nair joked in the intro that it\r\nwas the first Disney film set in Africa that doesn\u2019t have a single animal in\r\nit). From the way Nair and her designer use costumes to convey economic status to how the great cinematographer Sean Bobbitt (\u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d) fluidly\r\ncaptures a corner of the world that makes it feel specific, \u201cQueen of Katwe\u201d is a team effort. With the combined efforts of Nalwanga,\r\nNair, Nyong\u2019o, Oyelowo, Bobbitt and many more, \u201cQueen of Katwe\u201d makes it clear\r\nthat we can\u2019t successfully tell \u201cour stories\u201d alone. To make them resonate, we\r\nneed people this talented working together for a common goal. It seems unlikely\r\nthat Phiona Mutesi ever imagined her life would one day be the subject of a Disney\r\nfilm. But she certainly learned that life is full of surprises. When it\r\ncomes to movie surprises, \u201cQueen of Katwe\u201d is a truly pleasant one.", "Critic": "Beta"}
