{"Title": "Our Kind of Traitor", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The work of the British novelist John le Carr\u00e9 is inextricably linked, in the minds of many readers, with the Cold War. But he, like many others plugged into current events, has long understood that the fall of the Soviet Union did not, by any means, put an end to Russian, British and American-accented espionage hijinks. His 2010 novel, \u201cOur Kind of Traitor,\u201d capitalizes on explicit links between high profit gangsterism in the former USSR and government corruption in the West, whose self-righteous self-image is just one reason it likes to keep such things tightly under wraps.\u00a0 Advertisement \n The movie adaptation, directed by Susanna White and starring Ewan McGregor, Naomie Harris, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Damian Lewis, is a handsome and often absorbing picture. It begins with the depiction of an unusual ceremony, culminating in the bestowal of a pistol on someone we believe to be a lucky dealmaker; as is the custom in old gangster movies, however, the gift is in fact a \u201cmarked for death\u201d gesture, and several bleakly depicted murders follow, in the snow, yet. Cut to the altogether sultrier climes of Marrakesh, where McGregor\u2019s Perry Makepeace (nice name, John) is unsuccessfully trying to warm up longtime girlfriend Gail (Harris). A rift has occurred in their relationship, a bad one. And while it\u2019s not revealed for a while just what it was, it seems highly ill-advised for Perry, once by himself, to accept the invitation of a blustery Russian named Dima (Skarsg\u00e5rd) to go out and party with him. But go out and party with him he does, and while he\u2019s entranced by visions of (probable) call girls riding horses through the hallways of the site of the revels, he\u2019s also got sufficient conscience to step in and break up a sexual assault. Dima admires Perry\u2019s nerve, or stupidity, in this incident: the would-be rapist, a heavily tattooed ape, is, like Dima, a Russian mobster. Dima deems Perry either noble enough, or stupid enough, to entrust, and enlists him as a sort of carrier pigeon: Perry is to bring British intelligence a teaser of some incriminating evidence that Dima is willing to part with in exchange for safe haven for himself and his family in Britain. Seems he\u2019s under the impression that someone is going to be gifting him with a special pistol some time soon.\u00a0 \n Perry agrees, Gail semi-balks, and soon enough they\u2019re embroiled in a scheme headed by an agent who happens to have an agenda of his own pertaining to one of the British bigwigs on Dima\u2019s list of the corrupt. Far from a simple courier, Perry becomes a major player in the deal. Gail and Perry see their relationship healing as they get to know Dima and his family, and develop protective instincts toward them. Perry\u2019s a professor of poetics, and we see him teaching T.S. Eliot, and evoking Dante, one of Eliot\u2019s great heroes. Later in the movie a character speaks of a certain kind of espionage work as being for \u201cpeople disillusioned with their lives, who have lost their way \u2026 giv[ing] them back a sense of purpose.\u201d Which of course evokes the opening of Dante\u2019s \u201cDivine Comedy,\u201d in which the protagonist, at middle age, finds himself lost in a forest. And the movie ends with a shot that evokes both Eliot\u2019s \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d and the video for Yes\u2019 \u201cOwner of a Lonely Heart.\u201d These touches are a bit heavyhanded, to be honest, even as the movie\u2019s action, featuring train travel to secret rendezvous spots and other pleasing bits of spy movie spycraft, will prove a pleasure to the genre fan. While White\u2019s direction is atmospheric, the sense of tension never gets crucial; the movie\u2019s got more of a mood of resignation than of conflict. For all its respectful and respectable qualities, it also suffers from a certain inertia.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
