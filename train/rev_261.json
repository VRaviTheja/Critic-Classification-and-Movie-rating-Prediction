{"Title": "Term Life", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "First, the bad news. \u201cTerm Life,\u201d despite what you might\r\nexpect from its laughable poster and no-critics-screening VOD release, isn\u2019t \u201cfun bad.\u201d\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for the next \u201cThe Room,\u201d or even something akin to some of\r\nNicolas Cage\u2019s more YouTube-ready over-the-top performances, you\u2019ll have to\r\nlook elsewhere. No, \u201cTerm Life\u201d is just a run-of-the-mill, poorly made\r\nthriller that doesn\u2019t thrill. It\u2019s a wannabe noir with no atmosphere, and a waste\r\nof a talented cast by a director who really has no idea what to do with them.\r\nGreat actors wander in and out of a scene, some of them get shot, some just\r\ndisappear, and the move trudges onward. At least it pauses briefly to address\r\nVince Vaughn\u2019s ridiculous haircut.  Advertisement Vaughn stars as Nick Barrow, a man who literally introduces himself\r\nvia narration with the line \u201cI plan heists.\u201d (The narration is the only\r\nlaughably fun part of the movie with insanely on-the-nose bon mots like \u201cBeing\r\ninterrogated by a cartel leader is not how I expected my day to start out.\u201d)\r\nNick is to illegal activity as a wedding planner is to nuptials\u2014he designs the event and then gets a cut when it succeeds. His latest plan goes awry when the perpetrators\r\nare gunned down after pulling it off. It turns out that Nick\u2019s latest customer\r\nwas the son of a notorious cartel leader (Jordi Molla). If you\u2019re thinking that\r\na movie about a drug dealer getting vengeance for his son\u2019s murder would be\r\nenough, you\u2019re ahead of \u201cTerm Life.\u201d It ALSO turns out that the robbery\r\naggravated a dirty cop named Keenan (Bill Paxton) and his crew (including Mike\r\nEpps and Shea Wigham) are the ones who actually killed the drug lord\u2019s kid to\r\nget back what he stole.  Still not enough movie for you? OK, let\u2019s graft on a\r\nfather-daughter plot. When Nick realizes that a notorious criminal mastermind\r\nand a team of dirty cops are after him, he does what any estranged father would\r\ndo\u2014he buys life insurance (hence the film\u2019s name). But, as he\u2019s told by the\r\ninsurance agent (a fascinatingly underused Taraji P. Henson, who sells the\r\npolicy and disappears), he has to survive three weeks for the blood work to go\r\nthrough, or else his daughter Cate (Hailee Steinfeld) won\u2019t get anything when\r\nhe\u2019s iced. So, Nick and Cate go on the run, provoking the suspicions of a small\r\ntown cop played by another actor too good for the size of his role (Terrence Howard).\r\nI didn\u2019t even mention the fact that Cate\u2019s mother is a recovering alcoholic. It\u2019s\r\nall so much movie and yet so little at the same time. The every-clich\u00e9-and-the-kitchen-sink approach of \u201cTerm Life\u201d\r\nleads to a crushingly bland affair. It\u2019s kind of like how every color blends\r\nto gray eventually. Nothing in \u201cTerm Life\u201d is developed enough in its 93-minute\r\nrun time to give it any weight. Paxton\u2019s villainous cop deserved a better movie\r\n(there\u2019s a scene in the middle between him and Wigham that is a perfect example\r\nof a point where the film could have become something else but went back to the\r\nmiddle of the road), as does the great Jonathan Banks\u2019 buddy and even Jon Favreau\u2019s\r\ncriminal lackey. Most of all, the talented Steinfeld gives \u201cTerm Life\u201d way more\r\nthan the film deserves, playing the anger of a young woman ignored by her\r\nfather her entire life. Sadly, Billingsley doesn\u2019t know what to do with her\r\nperformance, too often pushing it back to clich\u00e9. What do teen girls do? Go swimsuit shopping! (For the record, this is where I would have checked out were it not my professional obligation to continue.) Advertisement Ultimately, there\u2019s no sense of danger or world creation\r\nhere. These people don\u2019t exist in the real world, and Billingsley has no idea\r\nhow to make it feel like they do. It\u2019s one of those films that thinks casting\r\nequates to audience concern. Why do we care about what happens to Nick and\r\nKate? Because their faces are on the poster. And it absolutely fails as an\r\naction film. Billingsley, the director of \u201cCouples Retreat,\u201d does not have any clue what to do with stunt work or shoot-out choreography. There\u2019s one\r\nscene in which Nick is supposed to throw a guy out a window and the stunt man\r\nbasically just runs for the glass, while Vaughn pats him on the back on the way\r\nby. It\u2019s the one time I laughed.", "Critic": "Beta"}
