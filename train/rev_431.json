{"Title": "Ballet 422", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Art isn\u2019t easy. That\u2019s the main \u201ctakeaway\u201d from this brisk\r\nand engaging documentary, directed by Jody Lee Lipes. After a few text notes\r\nexplaining who the main players are\u2014they are the New York City Ballet and a\r\ndancer/choreographer named Justin Peck\u2014\u201cBallet 422\u201d chronicles the creation of\r\nthe four-hundred-and-twenty-second original ballet mounted by the company, from\r\nits conception to opening night.  As in the films of documentarians David and Albert Maysles\r\nand Frederick Wiseman, this true-life chronicle eschews both narration and\r\non-camera interview. Justin Peck does not explain the premise of his ballet,\r\nhis reason for choosing the music (\u201cSinfonietta La Jolla\u201d by 20th-century\r\ncomposer Bohuslav Martinu), or any such thing; instead, Lipes\u2019 cameras show him\r\nthinking and working in an empty rehearsal room with a boom box, or in his\r\nquiet walk-up apartment. Soon he\u2019s laying out moves for his lead dancers,\r\nconferring with the costume designers, lighting directors, the orchestra\r\nconductors, and so on.  Advertisement The process as chronicled by Lipes is relatively drama-free\r\nbut extremely labor intensive. Nobody\u2019s a diva, voices are never raised,\r\nthere\u2019s no last-minute crisis. Which isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t tension, or\r\nirony, or interest. Part of the magic of the dance, if you\u2019re a fan of it (it\u2019s\r\nnot really my cup of tea, but you can\u2019t like EVERYTHING), is the illusion that\r\nthe work you\u2019re watching has just been conjured out of thin air, and all of the\r\nmembers of the team creating Peck\u2019s ballet are master illusionists. But they\u2019re\r\nalso people with jobs, and the movie does an excellent job of showing the\r\ncommonplace workaday atmosphere that is, in fact, a big part of that business\r\nwe call show.  Peck is quiet, conscientious, dedicated, and well-mannered,\r\nwhich is in pretty stark contrast to Brock Enright, the subject of Lipes\u2019 2009\r\nfilm \u201cGood Times Will Never Be The Same,\u201d which depicted Enright generally being the worst person in the world, and ended with\r\nthe nightmare vision of his actually spawning. But Lipes also depicted Enright\r\nas a guy with a work ethic. So there IS a thematic throughline here,\r\nauteurists. The irony of Peck\u2019s position is, while he\u2019s on the rise as a\r\nchoreographer, as a dancer he\u2019s in a rather more plebian position, which\r\nprovides the movie with a punchline that Lipes neither overstates nor shrugs\r\noff. The movie, which sticks to a relatively rough-and-ready handheld visual\r\nstyle for the most part (Lipes\u2019 is largely known for his work as a\r\ncinematographer; he\u2019s collaborated closely with Lena Dunham and shot Judd Apatow\u2019s\r\nupcoming \u201cTrainwreck\u201d), ends on a very beautiful and still shot of the site of\r\nthe City Ballet that will remind New York-based viewers of their cultural\r\nprivilege, and maybe goad them into taking advantage of it more often. Heck, I\r\nwas thinking maybe of checking out a ballet, even.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
