{"Title": "The Diabolical", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Don\u2019t you hate it when you\u2019re Googling instructions on how\r\nto file for bankruptcy on your computer, and all of a sudden your house starts\r\nactually shuddering, a flash of lighting happens inside your own living room,\r\nand suddenly a guy who look like all of his flesh had been flayed off, and has\r\nsome kind of stretchy membrane coating his facial features and blocking his mouth, starts moving in agonized pain across your floor? It\u2019s distracting, right? And\r\nsay you\u2019re the little fellow of the house and you get a late-night hankering\r\nfor a peanut-butter sandwich, and just as you\u2019re laying down the peanut butter, the lightning flashes and there\u2019s the aforementioned dude crouching around the\r\ncorner of your kitchen cabinets, and he scares you so much you drop your plate\r\nand cut your feet on the shards? Then there\u2019s that thing when some otherworldly\r\nforce takes over your laundry room, and after making the appliances practically\r\nbounce around the floor, out of the dryer pops Mr. Flayed Skin Dude? Oy vey. Advertisement Unexplained malevolent forces manifest themselves as\r\nExtremely Irritating Household Disturbances in \u201cThe Diabolical,\" the debut feature\r\nfrom director Alistair Legrand, who co-wrote the film with Luke Harvis. To its\r\ncredit, the economical horror/sci-fi film gets right into the swing of the\r\nscary stuff; the bankruptcy-exploration-interruption is the movie\u2019s very first\r\nscene. Single mom Madison (Ali Larter) and her kids Jacob and Haley (Max Rose\r\nand Chloe Perrin) are not quite inured to these weird interludes, but they\u2019re\r\nused to them. Jacob, a super-smart kid who\u2019s also battling anger issues,\r\nvehemently denies to younger sister Haley that the strange being visiting them\r\nis the ghost of their departed dad, but there are hints that whoever the\r\ninterloper is, he knows the family well. An early visit from some psychic\r\ndetectives yields no useful info\u2014in fact the investigators leave the house in a\r\nclose-mouthed semi-panic\u2014and soon an oily real-estate fellow shows up telling\r\nthe strapped-for-cash and behind-on-the-mortgage-payments Madison that he\u2019s in\r\na position to make a \u201cvery attractive offer\u201d on the house.  Problem solved? Not quite. Further developments make it\r\nnot-so-desirable for Madison and the kids to actually leave the house, so for Madison it\u2019s back to Google, where she\r\nfinds some intriguing news concerning proton accelerator experiments. Really.\r\nEnlisting her boyfriend, Jacob\u2019s science teacher Nikolai (Arjun Gupta), they\r\nhole up and try to collect \u201cdata,\u201d as the reappearing visitor takes more and\r\nmore solid human form. The mystery they uncover, while not entirely unfamiliar\r\nonce the pieces come together, yields some reasonably diverting twists. Only trouble is, none of the elements\u2014the\r\nscary stuff, the psychological drama, the family-dynamic crises\u2014really deliver\r\nthe wallop necessary to provide truly memorable horror fare. There\u2019s also the\r\nfact that, while having a horrifying figure with flayed skin emerge from a\r\nwashing machine door is both a novel and memorable trope/image, it\u2019s also a\r\nkind of ridiculous one. I\u2019ve rated this movie relatively generously only\r\nbecause, you know, it\u2019s Halloween and all.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
