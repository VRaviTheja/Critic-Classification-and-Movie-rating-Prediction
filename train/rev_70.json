{"Title": "Neither Heaven Nor Earth", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Cl\u00e9ment Cogitore\u2019s strong \u201cNeither Heaven Nor Earth\u201d reminds\r\none of \u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d and \u201cAbout Elly\u201d in how those films use disappearance\r\nas a thematic tool more than an unsolved mystery demanding resolution.\r\nCogitore defines his setting well, focusing on the wind, sun and sand of\r\nAfghanistan 2014 as a French group of soldiers keep the fragile peace and\r\nplan for departure. It\u2019s a world that seems mostly harmless, but an early\r\nshoot-out with Taliban in the hills makes it clear that the potential for danger remains. It\u2019s\r\nin this unique setting, a place that inherently feels like purgatory for those\r\nstuck there, that Cogitore crafts a tense tale of faith and mystery.  Advertisement After an encounter with a man and his sheep who get too\r\nclose to their guard post, a pair of French soldiers in Afghanistan, well,\r\ndisappear. One night, they\u2019re watching figures on the horizon. The next\r\nmorning, they are simply gone. Satellite images of the area offer no insight.\r\nThe commander, a confident man named Antar\u00e8s (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier), is naturally\r\nconvinced that they were kidnapped by local opposing forces. Through a\r\ntranslator, he interrogates the denizens of a local village, but his men have\r\nsimply vanished off the face of the Earth. He orders everyone to keep their\r\ndisappearance secret until he can figure out what is going on. Then more men\r\ndisappear. In this rock-strewn middle of nowhere, a man partnered with\r\nanother soldier in a bunker steps outside to urinate. We watch him through the\r\ndoor, knowing that danger\u2014both physical and possibly supernatural\u2014lurks over\r\nthe horizon. Our movie-watching sensibility trains us to fear for his\r\nsafety. We\u2019re in the bunker, he\u2019s out in the dangerous world. He returns to the\r\nbunker and his fellow soldier is gone. This scene really sets the tone for \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d given it\u2019s unbroken nature\u2014we know no one could have come in\r\nand kidnapped this man\u2014and the way Cogitore smartly keeps us in the bunker,\r\nwhere something happens. Exactly what that something is starts to drive Antar\u00e8s\r\ncrazy. As fear starts to overtake the soldiers underneath him, this practical\r\nleader questions what he knows as true\u2014men don\u2019t just disappear. \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d is effective more as a study of fear and failed leadership\r\nthan it is as a horror movie. In fact, if it has a weakness it\u2019s that audiences\r\nexpecting it to build to something tenser or even terrifying will be\r\ndisappointed. It drags a bit around the hour mark when it needs to be building\r\ntension and/or deepening its thematic points. There\u2019s also an underdeveloped\r\nsubplot of sleep deprivation, in that everyone becomes convinced that sleep-time is when people are taken by whatever force is removing them from this barren\r\nlandscape. Terrified and sleep-deprived in a war-torn country? There are times\r\nwhen I wanted those feelings to register more primally and emotionally than\r\nCogitore seems interested in doing. Advertisement Most of the directorial flaws and arguably wasted\r\nopportunity of the final act of \u201cNeither Heaven Nor Earth\u201d are offset by the unshowy,\r\ngrounded way in which Renier grounds the film. A regular collaborator of the\r\nDardennes brothers (\u201cL\u2019Enfant,\u201d \u201cThe Kid with a Bike\u201d), Renier has the natural\r\ncharisma of a born leader that\u2019s fascinating to see undermined by the unique\r\nsituations he finds himself in. While Cogitore generally allows viewers to\r\nplay with the film\u2019s themes to whatever degree they desire (don\u2019t all men\r\ndisappear to some extent during war, for example), Renier has to play the reality\r\nof the situation, and does so admirably. It\u2019s his plight\u2014that of a man\r\ntrained to be rational but now faced with the irrational\u2014that keeps \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d moving. And like those films that inspired it that I\r\nmentioned in the introduction, it\u2019s not the solution to the mystery that matters but\r\nwhat the mystery itself does to those who face it.", "Critic": "Beta"}
