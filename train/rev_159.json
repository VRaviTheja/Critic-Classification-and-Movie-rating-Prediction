{"Title": "Meru", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The connection between the legendary George Mallory and\r\nrenowned climber Conrad Anker, one of the subjects \u201cMeru\u201d is more than just\r\nhistorical. Believe it or not, Anker is the man who found Mallory\u2019s body on\r\nMount Everest in 1999, which made headlines around the world. Anker also seems\r\nto wholeheartedly subscribe to the theory captured by Mallory\u2019s three most\r\nfamous words: \u201cBecause it\u2019s there.\u201d In\r\nthat oft-quoted phrase, so much of the human desire to surmount the impossible\r\nis captured. Although the quote is often misinterpreted as a way to offer proof\r\nof inconsequential reasons to do what logic tells us we should not. Another\r\ninterpretation is that there aren\u2019t words to capture why people go to the Moon,\r\ncome back from the brink of death, or climb Mount Everest. They just do.\r\nBecause it\u2019s there. The men of \u201cMeru\u201d tried to go to a place that all common\r\nsense dictated they should not. They tried to climb a sheer wall that no one\r\nhad ever climbed before. Their story is undeniably interesting. However, and\r\nthis is the tricky part about reviewing documentaries, the movie about that\r\nstory is flawed. A bit too much time is spent in admiration and hero worship\r\nover the indefatigable will of these men, when it is the footage on that\r\nmountainside that matters. It\u2019s a story that speaks for itself, and so the\r\nemphasis on talking heads explaining it to us is dispiriting.  Advertisement The Shark\u2019s Fin on Mount Meru has long been the ultimate\r\nprize in mountain climbing. It is a ridiculous creation of Mother Nature,\r\nperched over 20,000 feet above the Ganges River and essentially flat and\r\nstraight-up. It is not a mountain; it is a wall. At the most challenging part\r\nof its ascent, climbers often travel 200 meters in ONE DAY. That\u2019s the\r\ninch-by-inch progress it takes to get to the top. And if you plan poorly or\r\nmerely get hit by bad weather, you better turn around if you ever want to see\r\nyour family again. As explained in the film, it is the anti-Everest in that\r\nthere are no Sherpas. No help. No one to do the grunt work. You are on your own\r\nclimbing a smooth, featureless face. In October 2008, Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin (credited with\r\nco-directing \u201cMeru\u201d) and Renan Ozturk tried to tackle Meru. They filmed much of\r\nthe perilous journey, and this material is easily the strongest in \u201cMeru.\u201d When\r\nthe filmmakers stop the musical score and stop the narration, and simply allow\r\nus to listen to the wind and the snow pummeling these men, the physical\r\nchallenge is palpable. The trio failed in 2008. In a remarkable scene, they look\r\nalmost close enough to the summit to touch it, but they figure out that the sun\r\nwill set soon, they have nowhere to camp, and they would not survive the\r\nconditions. They look like they literally could throw something to the top, but\r\nthey have to turn back and go all the way back down. They were 100 meters away.\r\n Defeated, it looks unlikely that the trio will go back\r\nagain. In an interesting footnote not given enough attention, Jimmy reveals\r\nthat it was the failure of another group of climbers to reach the top that\r\nreally got him thinking about attempting it again. There\u2019s something so\r\nattractive about being the first.\r\nRisking your life to be #2 isn\u2019t as exciting. And so after some remarkable\r\nspeed bumps are placed in their way but surpassed, the trio takes another shot\r\nat it. \u201cMeru\u201d works best, by far, in its \u201cYou Are There\u201d moments.\r\nYou hear heavy breathing, the elements whip the tent, and it sounds like the\r\nworld is ending. At one point in the first climb\u2014and it\u2019s really why it failed\u2014they\r\nare stuck, literally, on the side of the mountain for FOUR DAYS, as the\r\nelements made it impossible to move. Why would anyone do this? Negative 20\r\ndegree weather in the shade. Why do it beyond \u201cBecause it\u2019s there\u201d? \u201cMeru\u201d\r\ndoesn\u2019t really go into that, which would be fine, if it didn\u2019t spend so much\r\ntime talking about mountain climbing. The film is weighed down with interview\r\nfootage, a lot of which is essentially fan service\u2014how great these guys are,\r\nhow courageous they are, how tough they are. And I\u2019m not arguing they\u2019re not,\r\njust questioning the cinematic value of such an approach. \u201cMeru\u201d is billed as\r\nan awe-inspiring nature documentary, and it works best when it remembers to be\r\none.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
