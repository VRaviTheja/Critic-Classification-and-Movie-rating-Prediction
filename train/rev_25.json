{"Title": "The Mummy", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "By now you\u2019ve probably read a number of scathing reviews of \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d Universal\u2019s inaugural entry in a possibly grievously ill-advised \u201cDark Universe\u201d franchise, wherein the legendary studio intends to reboot its most Famous Monsters of Filmland. Perhaps I\u2019m becoming jaded in my old age, but I was more amused than appalled.  Don\u2019t get me wrong. \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d directed (if that\u2019s what you want to call it; I honestly think the better term here is \u201costensibly overseen on behalf of the studio executives\u201d) by Alex Kurtzman from a script by David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie, and Dylan Kussman, has plenty to get irritated about. I got sand in my synapses during an early scene in which Tom Cruise, as a looter named Nick Morton (oh, \u201cMort,\u201d I get it now), and his sidekick, played by Jake Johnson, casually slaughter a bunch of \u201cIraqi insurgents\u201d trying to track down a mysterious treasure. Oh, sure, filmmakers, by all means use a tragic and unnecessary war that\u2019s still yielding horrific consequences for the world as the backdrop for your stupid horror movie plot machinations, no problem here. Advertisement And, of course, there\u2019s the movie\u2019s very old-school sexism. \"The Mummy\" has two female characters: One is corrupt albeit not unattractive ancient Egyptian royal Ahmanet, who, once freed from her tomb in the present day, is the incarnation of all evil and stuff. (She is played by Sofia Boutella, whose filmography testifies that she\u2019s accustomed to being ill-used in motion pictures). The other is faux-archeologist/genuine anti-evil secret agent Jenny (Annabelle Wallis) who\u2019s mainly around to be rescued by Nick, and whose surface venality suggests that his business card describes him as a \u201clovable rogue.\u201d  So yes, should one choose to take offense, one certainly may. But I have to be honest\u2014speaking of venality, I found something almost admirable about the film\u2019s cheek. It\u2019s amazingly relentless in its naked borrowing from other, better horror and sci-fi movies that I was able to keep occupied making a checklist of the movies referenced. At its opening, remnants of a past civilization are discovered while workmen are tunneling underground for a new subway route. That\u2019s from \u201cQuatermass and the Pit,\u201d aka \u201cFive Million Miles to Earth.\u201d As many other reviewers have noted, once Jake Johnson\u2019s character buys in and is reborn as a wisecracking undead sidekick warning Nick about how he\u2019s been cursed by incarnation-of-evil Ahmanet, it\u2019s \u201cAmerican Werewolf in London\u201d time, albeit with PG-13-rated special effects rather than the side of ketchup-dipped corned beef that fell from Griffin Dunne\u2019s face in the earlier movie. What else? A woman whose kiss drains the life force out of those who receive it, from the wacky space-vampire movie \u201cLifeforce\u201d? Check. A brain-draining insect in the ear from \u201cStar Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\u201d? Check. Spavined slapstick undead assaulters out of \u201cEvil Dead\u201d? Check. Underwater fights with the undead out of Lucio Fulci\u2019s \u201cZombie\u201d? Check. (These too are toned down considerably from the source material.) Someone saying \u201cPlans?\u201d with the precise intonation Sir Ralph Richardson used in \u201cTales from the Crypt\u201d? Also check. Don\u2019t even get me started on the, um, appropriation of a famous line from the Universal monster movie \u201cBride of Frankenstein.\u201d But that\u2019s life, and that movie literally IS Universal\u2019s property.  There have been a lot of crocodile tears already shed about the fact that The Mighty Tom Cruise has allowed himself to be used in such dreck, and also that Russell Crowe has been compelled to continue to sink into a form of self-parody by appearing as the head of Jenny\u2019s anti-evil agency, a character named Dr. Henry Jekyll, and yeah, it\u2019s the same guy. Or some iteration of the same guy. As it happens, Dr. Jekyll was never one of the Universal Studios monsters, but the character IS in the public domain, so I guess the corporate overlords of the Dark Universe figured \u201cwhat the you-know-what.\u201d\u00a0  Advertisement Anyway, I cannot feel too aggrieved for either star. As Richard Harris and Richard Burton found out for themselves many years before Crowe came along, there comes a time in the career of every loose-cannon macho actor where the any-port-in-a-financial-year-storm approach to career management is all for the best. As for Cruise, he is known for his try-anything-once sense of cinematic adventure, and he does like his franchises. The Morton character is admittedly more of a callow nothingburger than any he\u2019s played. And given how the movie ends I\u2019m a little disappointed that he wasn\u2019t named Larry Talbot. But who knows, maybe he\u2019ll be obliged to change it for the next installment. Which I am looking forward to, out of nothing but base curiosity.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
