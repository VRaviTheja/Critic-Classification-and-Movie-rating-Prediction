{"Title": "By Sidney Lumet", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Sidney Lumet made 44 films in 50 years. That kind of prodigious output would be impressive even if he was merely turning out for-hire studio work, but any film buff worth a conversation knows that\u2019s not the case with Lumet, who not only made films for five decades but made films that mattered. Famous for a social conscience reflected in films like \u201c12 Angry Men,\u201d \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d and \u201cRunning on Empty,\u201d Lumet was also a consummate \u201cactor\u2019s director\u201d and an underrated craftsman. I was honored to be asked to appear on the Director\u2019s Club podcast earlier this year in an episode devoted to the man, which allowed for a marathon of rewatches of a dozen or so of Lumet\u2019s films, and the scope of his talent remains breathtaking, from his first film to his last. So how could a movie possibly capture that vast of a career in only 100 minutes? Nancy Buirski\u2019s \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d is a gift to fans of the art of film directing. It is beautifully constructed, not as a chronological biography of a directorial legend but as a thematic exploration of his work. Comprised mostly of an interview conducted just a few years before his death, \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d won\u2019t just make you want to revisit his works but reappreciate the role of a great director in cinema. Advertisement Given the breadth of his accomplishments, it may come as a surprise how often a very humble Lumet speaks of luck. He recognizes how much of his best work came about because of the right contributions from the right people at the right time. All art has a degree of blessed coincidence, and it\u2019s surprising how much Lumet begins the film discussing this element of his career, such as when he was tapped to direct \u201c12 Angry Men.\u201d He also speaks at length about his upbringing in Yiddish theater, and a strict father, who was also an actor. Buirski works thematically in the construction of her film\u2014for example, she\u2019ll go from a story about Lumet\u2019s father to a scene from \u201cDaniel\u201d or \u201cRunning on Empty,\u201d illustrating how Lumet\u2019s life experience influenced his filmography. By avoiding the so-typical construction of chronological biography, Buirski gets at something much deeper: the \u201cchapter\u201d of Lumet\u2019s life about his father didn\u2019t end when his dad passed but was reflected throughout his career, all the way to the dynamic between Philip Seymour Hoffman and Albert Finney in \u201cBefore the Devil Knows You\u2019re Dead.\u201d  \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d doesn\u2019t skimp on technical or filmmaking anecdotes as well. One of my favorite films of all time, \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d sparks a discussion of color palettes, and how he purposefully didn\u2019t use one in that movie to keep it as realistic as possible. As he says, the worst-case scenario would be for the audience to not identify with Al Pacino\u2019s character because he was gay, so he had to ground the film as realistically as possible visually to amplify the commonality. To that end, there was no costume design. Everyone wore their own clothes. Buirski also doesn\u2019t shy away from showing extended clips, including a scene with Pacino to serve as an example of the truth of his performance, one of my favorites of all time. Clearly, I\u2019m a Lumet fan, so here\u2019s where I have to step back and wonder if \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d would work for those who aren\u2019t. While the thematic assembly is invigorating for those of us who know his career and biography chronologically, it may be off-putting or even frustrating for more casual fans. And sometimes it does feel like the balance can be slightly out of whack. It\u2019s well over an hour before we get to anything related to \u201cNetwork,\u201d \u201cPrince of the City\u201d or \u201cThe Verdict,\u201d and one could easily do a full documentary on those three films alone. For non-Lumet fans, it may be too much of one thing. For Lumet fans, it may be not enough of his best work. It\u2019s impossible to capture every facet of a career as vast and influential as Lumet\u2019s in one interview documentary, and I would argue that Buirski isn\u2019t really trying to do that. She doesn\u2019t speak to collaborators of Lumet\u2019s or those influenced by him. This is not that film. It is a conversation, one of the last of its type, with a master filmmaker. Personally, I wish we had more of them. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
