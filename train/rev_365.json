{"Title": "Mine", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Fabio Guaglione & Fabio Resinaro\u2019s \u201cMine\u201d is practically a one-man show. There are tech elements that are essential to its success, but this film lives and dies on what Armie Hammer does at its center. He\u2019s not only in every scene, he\u2019s often the only person in the scene, playing a guy trapped in the middle of nowhere and reflecting on exactly how he got there. Hammer is riding a wave of success and acclaim, appearing in \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d and \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d last year and about to blow people away in \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d later this year. It\u2019s easy to see him becoming one of his generation\u2019s most interesting actors. And when that happens people will come back to this relatively small thriller and appreciate how he\u2019s had the skills for some time now. Every time that \u201cMine\u201d threatens to come apart under its own pretensions (which is relatively often), Hammer does something subtle and believable to ground it.\u00a0 Advertisement Mike (Hammer) is a sniper; Tommy (Tom Cullen) is his spotter. They are on a ridge, on assignment in a dusty land, when it looks like their target is in sight. A convoy comes over the horizon, met by another group of people in the sand. Over the radio, Mike hears that their target is in the last car, but the color is wrong. Mike hesitates. What if this is the wrong guy? And the situation is complicated even further when Mike and Tommy realize that the group below them is gathered for a wedding. Is Mike really going to shoot the father of the bride at a ceremony when he\u2019s not even positive it\u2019s the right guy? He hesitates long enough that the situation goes haywire, and Mike and Tommy are forced to walk hours to the nearest village. Then Tommy steps on a land mine. And so does Mike.  Much like \u201cBuried\u201d or \u201cThe Shallows\u201d trapped their protagonist in a specific place, Mike literally can\u2019t move his left foot or risk going boom. He calls in the disastrous situation they\u2019re in and is told that someone can come rescue him \u2026 in 72 hours. He considers something daring called \u201cThe Shoeman Maneuver\u201d that involves basically digging a trench next to you and then trying to fall in it in time to minimize damage. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll only lose a leg. He has to deal with sandstorms, running out of water, and animals in the middle of the night. And then he starts going crazy, flashing back to his abusive father and a wife he left behind. \u201cMine\u201d is unapologetically philosophical. We all have land mines in our life that we\u2019re not willing to step off, dude. It\u2019s a film in which a character literally says, \u201cEvery day can be your last step.\u201d Oh, really? Thanks. In remembered moments of his past that got him here, we literally hear a mine sound, as if Mike has stepped on them symbolically before. We get it. \u201cMine\u201d is the kind of movie in which you will even likely say, out loud, \u201cWe get it,\u201d at least once. It hammers its themes and messages, and then hammers them again and again and again. Advertisement While it\u2019s clear that the filmmakers were somewhat scared of the simplicity of their concept in the way they weigh it down with flashbacks and messaging, the real tragedy is that Hammer could have pulled off a real one-man show. He does some of the hardest work of his career here, conveying both the trauma of his situation and the baggage that Mike brought with him to the desert. We believe that Mike is likely going to die\u2014eaten by animals, blown up by a mine, or simply dying of thirst. It\u2019s odd to say that Hammer gives a physical performance given he\u2019s stuck in one place, but he remarkably sells his predicament as a real, dangerous one. The film works because of him (with a shout-out to excellent editing by Filippo Mauro Boni, Guaglione, and Matteo Santi, too).\u00a0It\u2019s a really good performance from an actor I suspect will give several great ones over the course of his career.", "Critic": "Beta"}
