{"Title": "The Treasure", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The Romanian director Corneliu Porumboiu has a style that\u2019s likely\u2014and I\u2019m being super-optimistic here\u2014a potentially acquired taste for mainstream American moviegoers. His best-known picture in this country is 2009\u2019s \u201cPolice, Adjective,\u201d a tense and mordantly funny drama whose examination of the ethics of law-enforcement (which climaxes in a marathon scene centered around the definition of the word \u201cpolice,\u201d hence the movie\u2019s title) gained extra resonance for being made and set in a country that was for much of the 20th century more or less a police state. His best movies embody a kind of stylistic paradox: they are slow-paced, but also narratively concise; they contain long, slow scenes in which nothing in particular \u201chappens\u201d but they also feel entirely fat-free.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Porumboiu\u2019s new picture \u201cThe Treasure\u201d is entirely in keeping with that mode but also expands on it, with disarmingly delightful results. It is in a sense the director\u2019s first out-and-out comedy, and it\u2019s also something of a fairytale. No sooner has the movie begun, with working man Costi (Toma Cuzin) invoking Robin Hood to gain his son\u2019s pardon for picking him up from school late, than the not-thematically-unrelated premise pops up: Costi\u2019s neighbor Adrian (Adrian Parcarescu) knocks on the door and requests an 800 Euro loan. Costi\u2019s pretty strapped for cash himself, so he demurs, but soon Adrian is spinning an intriguing tale: he wants the money to buy a metal detector to go searching for buried treasure in the yard of a relative\u2019s house in the country.\u00a0 \n It\u2019s a ridiculous idea on its face, and Costi\u2019s wife implies as much, as they sit in their kitchen and discuss it. The white tile of that room is identical to that seen in Adrian\u2019s apartment, and it brings home the humdrum nature of existence for the lower middle class in Bucharest; it\u2019s like they\u2019re all actually living on the set of \u201cTHX-1138.\" And even Costi and Adrian\u2019s soon-shared dream of riches has a societal catch: if what they uncover is determined to have \u201cstate heritage\u201d value they\u2019re obliged to turn over the find to authorities, who will allow the duo to have 30% of its worth. Costi soon finds a metal-detector/treasure hunting \u201cexpert\u201d named Cornel (Corneliu Cozmei) who\u2019s willing to cut some corners and most importantly not rat out the fellows, and soon they\u2019re in the village of Islaz with picks and shovels and a metal detector whose annoying noise means real encouragement for their prospects. \n Once there, the fellows discover that digging for treasure is no picnic, and Porumboiu is painstaking in depicting the hard labor and quiet frustration. By this time the movie has found a quiet comic tone that\u2019s terrifically dry and droll. Trying to mask his activities from his boss, Costi goes along with that fellow\u2019s suggestions that he\u2019s involved in an extramarital affair, which admission first elicits the man\u2019s nudge-nudge-wink-wink approval, then his mild disapprobation. It\u2019s good absurdist stuff, a little reminiscent of the work of Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki, albeit without that filmmaker\u2019s wooly-headed whimsy. It does help, though, to be a good \u201cGodot\u201d person if you\u2019re going to appreciate the push-me/pull-you tensions of the digging scene. Advertisement \n After which come a few twists, which lead up to a denouement that, surprisingly enough, may prove richly satisfying to viewers more accustomed to conventional fare, provided they\u2019ve been able to stick it out. The film\u2019s final scene is both charming and hilarious and puts a delightful ribbon on top of what the film\u2019s opening so sneakily established. I\u2019m not sure if Porumboiu\u2019s choice of a closing song\u2014it\u2019s by Laibach, just to let you know\u2014is meant to undercut the ending or not. I don\u2019t think it does. And even if it does, I\u2019m not too concerned.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
