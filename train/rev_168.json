{"Title": "The Miracle Season", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "One of the most immediately noteworthy things about this movie is how clean everybody and everything in it is. \u201cThe Miracle Season\u201d opens with voiceover from Kelly (Erin Moriarty), telling the audience about how amazing it is to find a friend who makes you believe you can fly. Kelly and said friend, Caroline (Danika Yarosh) are seen as little girls and then teens, goofing around in a slightly converted barn that has nary a dust mote floating in it. Soon we\u2019re tooling around with teens Kelly and \u201cLine\u201d (that\u2019s Caroline\u2019s nickname) in a spotless sea-blue convertible; the girls are dressed in immaculate jerseys and shorts; they park outside a bakery and even the early autumn leaves on the sidewalk look as if they\u2019ve been freshly rinsed and meticulously placed. Stars Hollow looks like a neighborhood from a particularly grungy \u201cLaw and Order: SVU\u201d episode by comparison. And West High School, where the girls play volleyball, makes the high school in \u201cLove, Simon\u201d look like the one from \u201cThe Blackboard Jungle.\u201d Advertisement Caroline and Kelly themselves are similarly well-scrubbed. Line is very lively but wholesome; her mischievous streak is never malicious but aims to push her friends to do things they might never have tried. As when she pushed Kelly to invite a handsome new neighbor to the season kickoff party at the dust-free barn Line\u2019s dad owns, or when she impulsively challenges her teammates to partake in a pizza-eating contest, which move doesn\u2019t sit well with her no-nonsense volleyball coach, Kathy Bresnahan, played by Helen Hunt. Coach Bresnahan is particularly irked because her team was the state champion of 2010, and \u201cBres,\u201d as her charges call her, doesn\u2019t want that to be a fluke.    The reason the movie\u2019s set in 2010 is because it\u2019s based on a true story, and the true story gets rolling with a tragedy: Caroline\u2019s death in a driving accident just as the season\u2019s getting underway. The movie\u2019s particular cushy sheen, engineered by director Sean McNamara, means that of course the accident is not depicted. But Caroline\u2019s character has been well enough embodied by Yarosh\u2019s performance that the loss registers, and the devastation of her teammates, not to mention her surgeon father, played by William Hurt, is felt.    To a certain extent. Given the title, you know that this movie is not selling suspense but inspiration. The dispirited team can\u2019t shake off the loss at first, but thanks to an example reluctantly set by Kelly, it starts to find its footing again. The determination to win \u201cfor Line\u201d pushes everyone, until the coach asks the near-impossible: that the team clear the board and get to the quarter-finals by taking fourteen games in a row.    I imagine it\u2019s hard to simulate volleyball games, and I don\u2019t have to imagine in order to remark that they are difficult to make exciting on film. So this movie goes for the heartstrings and tear ducts more than the sports-conscious. The results are pretty mixed. God bless William Hurt. The script gives him every excuse to phone in the part of Caroline\u2019s father by obliging him to speak lines like \u201cI may be the surgeon, but you\u2019re the hero out there.\u201d Despite that, he\u2019s straight and genuine throughout. As is Hunt, whose character\u2019s emotionally shut-down fa\u00e7ade gives way in a powerful scene near the end.    Problem is, every time the movie gets near an authentic emotion, it barely pauses before making a run to the next Katy Perry song cue. (Seriously, both \u201cRoar\u201d and \u201cFirework\u201d are featured herein.) Given the care that the adult and teen actors invested in trying to honor their real-life counterparts, this feels lazy. If you like Katy Perry songs that much, you may feel differently.\u00a0  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
