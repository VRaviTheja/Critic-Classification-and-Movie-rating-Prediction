{"Title": "Guardians of the Galaxy", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "You wouldn\u2019t know it to look at me now, but there was once a\r\ntime when I had quite a bit of expertise in the Marvel Universe. I came as\r\nclose to tearing up while reading a comic book as I\u2019ll ever do when the Scarlet\r\nWitch finally married The Vision\u00ad\u2014as eloquent an argument for marriage equality\r\nas genre fiction has ever essayed, by the way. I did, I must admit, check out\r\nwell before the entity called The Guardians of the Galaxy turned up in said\r\nuniverse. I bring this up because there are some MU characters in the movie \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" that I did recognize\u2014super-evil demigod Thanos, Drax\r\nThe Destroyer, and one or two others I guess\u2014but I ultimately found that it was\r\nthat particular continuity, the need to tie this movie\u2019s adventures into\r\nsomething larger, that made the movie lag a bit.  Advertisement In many respects, \u201cGuardians,\u201d directed and co-written by\r\nindie wit James Gunn, and starring buffed-up former schlub Chris Pratt and\r\nReally Big Sci-Fi Blockbuster vet Zoe Saldana (here dyed green as opposed to\r\nher \"Avatar\" blue), is a fun and relatively fresh space Western. Think \u201cFirefly\u201d pitched at 15-year-olds, with a lot of overt \"Star Wars\" nods. And super-\u201cirreverent\u201d\r\ndialogue that is, more often than not, genuinely funny. The wisecracking by the\r\ncharacters played by Pratt (a kind of junior Han Solo) and voiced by Bradley\r\nCooper (whose Rocket Raccoon, who is, yes, a genetically altered raccoon) is so\r\nincessant viewers of a certain age might wonder whether this movie has been put\r\nthrough the \"What\u2019s Up Tiger Lily\" dialogue-replacement treatment before\r\nrelease.  Pratt\u2019s self-styled \u201cStarlord\u201d and Rocket are not the strangest of\r\ninitially inadvertent teammates in this intergalactic posse. Saldana\u2019s Gamora\r\nis a stealthy warrior princess who\u2019s been lying low in an evil family before\r\nrevealing her good intentions; wrestling star Dave Bautista\u2019s Drax is a\r\nvengeance-driven behemoth whose florid language only briefly masks his\r\ninability to take anything other than literally; and Rocky\u2019s \u201cmuscle,\u201d Groot, is a walking,\r\nminimally talking tree. These guys are entertainingly motley, which makes the\r\nfact that their mission, to save the universe from a mass-murdering\r\nmegalomaniac who seeks an item which will grant him unimaginable mass-murdering\r\npower (yes, more mass-murdering power than he ever had before), is generic in a\r\nway that\u2019s pretty consistent with movies of this sort.  You may have noticed, incidentally, that a lot of film\r\ncritics tend to get kind of defensive when reviewing movies based on comic\r\nbooks. Like, you probably noticed that up top I tried to claim some comic\r\nbook-respecting bonafides. I\u2019ve done this thing before when reviewing\r\ncomic-book movies. Some day, I may have to actually bring out the big guns,\r\nlike the fact that I used to be palsy with Mike Kaluta, or that I once went to\r\na Halloween party at Berni Wrightson\u2019s house. I don\u2019t do this because I\u2019m afraid\r\nof getting death threats from easily irritated comic book fans (which hasn\u2019t\r\nhappened to me, and thanks). I do it because as someone who got a lot out of\r\ncomics growing up, and still has a healthy respect for the graphic form, I find\r\ncomic book movies kind of frustrating, and am bent out of shape by having my\r\nfrustration chalked up to a lack of understanding of the form.  Advertisement What does this\r\nhave to do with \u201cGuardians?\u201d It ties into what I mentioned before. While this\r\nmovie is pretty lively in a lot of its particulars, the stilted portent with\r\nwhich its villains\u2014the bumpy-jawed Thanos (Josh Brolin, not that you can tell)\r\nand the megalomaniacal Ronan (Lee Pace)\u2014make themselves felt is pretty tired.\r\nThe \u201cfunny animal\u201d tribute/homages of \u201cGuardians\u201d bump up uncomfortably against\r\nthe faux-majesty of the bad guys in a way that the actual comic-book form is\r\nmalleable enough to at least sidestep. I think Gunn knows it, too: one of the\r\nmovie\u2019s only genuinely subversive jokes sees one of the heroes actually yawning\r\nin the pro-forma slow-motion \u201cwalk to destiny\u201d shot that heralds the movie\u2019s\r\nclimax. Which climax is, as is also pro forma, big and loud and filled with\r\nindiscriminate destruction and slaughter of sentient beings. But as it takes\r\nplace on a planet other than the one the audience is on and so doesn\u2019t involve\r\nthe razing of a recognizable city, it\u2019s a little less troubling than it might\r\nhave been.  It seems as if I\u2019m listing a lot of not-fun things in what I\u2019ve\r\ncalled a fun movie, but again, I\u2019m just voicing some frustration because, in my\r\npuny mind\u2014which can only imagine the extent to which Gunn and his team had to\r\nfight for every bit of creative license they were allowed\u2014the not-fun parts\r\nseemed entirely avoidable. What will win the day among those not given to overthinking\r\nwill be the charm of the cast\u2014which also includes Benicio Del Toro in a bit\r\nrole that allows him to exercise a generous amount of his legendary performing\r\neccentricity, and Michael Rooker in a gruff part that would have gone to Ron\r\nPerlman had Guillermo Del Toro directed the movie\u2014the sunniness of its eventual\r\noptimism, and the infectiousness of its vintage-Earth-pop soundtrack. A\r\nsoundtrack the film\u2019s characters appreciate as much as the audience will, which\r\nis part of the whole point.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
