{"Title": "The Ballad of Lefty Brown", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "This picture asks a question that I do not think is much on the mind of contemporary moviegoers: \u201cWhat happens when a Western sidekick is suddenly bereft of his Western hero?\u201d Can a hero\u2019s journey withstand being undertook by Walter Brennan or Andy Devine? We first see Edward Johnson and Lefty Brown in the dead of night, cornering a bad man and then taking care of him in a manner that Mrs. Johnson, late in the movie, will call \u201cEddie\u2019s way.\u201d Grizzled, mutton-chopped Lefty, a shambling kind of fellow most take to be incompetent, says to tall-in-the-saddle Johnson, \u201cHelluva way to start your career as a Senator.\u201d Advertisement Lefty is played by Bill Pullman, who\u2019s long proven equally adept at playing reluctant heroes and erratic anti-heroes. Johnson is played by Peter Fonda, doing a very credible John Wayne impersonation. Out on Johnson\u2019s land, looking for a cattle rustler, the soon-to-go-to-Washington Johnson contemplates Lefty\u2019s future with him. He knows that Lefty is neither a favorite with the ranch hands or with Mrs. Johnson (Kathy Baker). \u201cI reckon you\u2019re gonna stand tall or you ain\u2019t,\u201d Jefferson says. No sooner does he bequeath Lefty his rifle than \u2026 boom. Johnson falls, shot through the head by a killer that Lefty nicknames \u201cBlondie.\u201d Yes, \u201cThe Ballad of Lefty Brown\u201d is a nouveau Western besotted by older Westerns. Aside from that \u201cThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\u201d reference, \u201cThe Ballad of\u00a0Lefty Brown\u201d nods to \u201cRio Bravo\u201d with its lawman Tom (Tommy Flanagan), a drunk who\u2019s explicitly referred to as a \u201cspittoon diver.\u201d The story\u2019s tendrils reach through \u201cThe Searchers\u201d and any Western in which the railroad is coming to town. Which is fine. Less fine is the often staggeringly relentless train of clich\u00e9s in the dialogue, as when Lefty comes back to the ranch, Johnson\u2019s corpse folded over the back of a horse. Furious, Baker\u2019s now-widow says \u201cYou were supposed to watch his back.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it,\u201d Lefty responds. \u201cSorry don\u2019t get it done,\u201d Mrs. Johnson responds. Thankfully the chat is suspended and Lefty goes renegade to track the killer. In the wild he meets a young, wet-behind-the-ears gunman who\u2019s more like a gunboy. Jeremiah, nicely played by Diego Josef, is a pretty wholesome and likable example of this character sort, and he gives Lefty a chance not just to mentor but to hone his own initially questionable skills. The duo, aided by Tom, track down the killer in relatively short order, which should tip off viewers that the killing was not quite so simple as it seemed. And indeed, it\u2019s a plot, rooted in all kinds of corruption and nastiness. It takes a rather long time to get to the end of the line, not because it\u2019s all that complicated, but because writer/director Jared Moshe doesn\u2019t quite split the difference between a relaxed pace and a fatty screenplay. That said, Pullman is always great to watch, the Montana landscapes are gorgeously captured by cinematographer David McFarland, and there are a couple of action set pieces that spark. One of them involves three men in long johns fighting; one is in handcuffs. A pretty novel approach. As new-fangled Westerns go, this is less brutal than 2015\u2019s \u201cForsaken,\u201d and perhaps better for it.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
