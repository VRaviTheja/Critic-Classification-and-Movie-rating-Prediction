{"Title": "24 Hours to Live", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "One of the most joyous elements of the success of \u201cJohn Wick\u201d was the way in which that film used Keanu Reeves\u2019 particular on-screen presence to greatest impact. Action films often play to the strengths of their leading men from the everyman persona Bruce Willis carried into \u201cDie Hard\u201d to the world-weariness of Liam Neeson in \u201cTaken,\u201d and so it was with Mr. Wick, a role that felt tailormade for Reeves. However, the opposite reaction is produced while watching \u201c24 Hours to Live,\u201d a film that seems at odds with the grounded personality of its leading man, the wonderful Ethan Hawke. Throughout the film, you can see Hawke trying to bring resonance and truth to a movie that is plotted like a \u201cCrank\u201d sequel and has dialogue that sounds like it was written by a teenage boy. Watching the actor fight against the deep flaws of the film he\u2019s in is almost more interesting than the plot itself. At least it\u2019s more entertaining. Advertisement Hawke plays Travis Conrad, a man introduced fishing with his father-in-law (Rutger Hauer), talking about his soul. Moments later, they\u2019re pouring out the ashes of Travis\u2019 wife and son, who died a year ago that day. The manipulative device of Conrad\u2019s grief over losing his family will return again and again, and never be anything more than a cheap screenwriting trick. And it\u2019s not even a well-done one. Torn from any sort of family loyalty, Conrad should be a loose cannon, but Hawke and director Brian Smrz never quite get there, making him more grief-stricken than out-for-vengeance, even when he finds out he\u2019s got, wait for it, \u201c24 Hours to Live.\u201d    You see, this is no ordinary assassin film. After Conrad is called in for one last assignment, for which he\u2019ll be paid $2 million, he ends up getting plugged a couple times in the street. He wakes up on an operating table with a gasp, told that the government has invented a new technology that can basically resurrect anyone with a catch: they\u2019ve got 24 hours. And to add a bit of cinematic flair to that countdown, they literally put a ticking clock in the patient\u2019s arm. So, the nefarious Powers That Be wake Conrad to get a piece of vital information from him that he learned just before getting shot. Of course, they don\u2019t consider that one of their best assets may not just want to wait out the next 23:55 in the operating room, and Conrad breaks out, turns the tables, and comes after the people who brought him back to life.    A little bit of \u201cCrank\u201d and a little bit of \u201cJohn Wick\u201d with Ethan Hawke? Sounds like a great idea. How could a movie with an assassin with a death timer in his arm be so dull? The main problem is the aforementioned disconnect between actor and project. Hawke brings gravity to his roles, and this movie needed insanity. He\u2019s such a relatable, humane actor, but this kind of part requires something hollower\u2014a cog in the B-movie machine. Whenever Hawke tries to sell it believably, we can see the plot holes and manipulative tricks. Believe it or not, most of this doesn\u2019t make sense (particularly the fact that they wake Conrad to get information on a location that likely would have been moved after a street shoot-out, but whatever). I wish I could say that \u201c24 Hours to Live\u201d works best if you just shut off your brain and stop asking questions, but the point is that it\u2019s never fun enough for that to work. Suspension of disbelief in B-movie action requires a degree of joyous, rollercoaster, unhinged filmmaking. \u201c24 Hours to Live\u201d is too boring to not ask questions.    Here\u2019s where we could pick apart further failed elements of \u201c24 Hours to Live\u201d including the uniformly horrible supporting cast and lackluster direction, but why bother? Ethan Hawke, who makes roughly six films a year, will shake this off and move on, probably finding his \"John Wick\" somewhere down the road. You should wait until he does.
