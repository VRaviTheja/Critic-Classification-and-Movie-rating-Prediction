{"Title": "Pay the Ghost", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Nicolas Cage is often accused of taking parts that don\u2019t\r\nchallenge his undeniable range, especially in recent years as the \"paycheck parts\" have piled up. His \u201810s output\r\nof films like \u201cRage,\u201d \u201cOutcast,\u201d \u201cStolen,\u201d \u201cThe Frozen Ground\u201d and \u201cLeft Behind\u201d make\r\nthis argument of creative coasting harder to dismiss (and almost more painful\r\nconsidering Cage delivered one of his career-best turns in the middle of this\r\ngarbage onslaught with \u201cJoe\u201d). Looking over Cage\u2019s resume, I considered the\r\nfollowing phrase carefully: \u201cPay the Ghost,\u201d out in very limited release today,\r\nis a new low for Nicolas Cage. Just when you thought he couldn\u2019t get any more apathetic\r\nabout a role, he pops up in this lazy, boring retread of \u201cInsidious\u201d that even\r\nhis most diehard fans should ignore.  Advertisement Based on a novella by Tim Lebbon, \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d stars Cage\r\nas Mike Lawford, an English teacher who drops references to Lovecraft and Johann\r\nWolfgang von Goethe just so you get the impression that Dan Kay\u2019s screenplay\r\ncomes with great literary aspirations. (Spoiler: It does not.) Lawford is married to Kristen (Sarah\r\nWayne Callies), and the two have a child named Charlie (Jack Fulton). Of\r\ncourse, Mike is a distant dad, not around enough as he tries to earn tenure at\r\nthe university where he teaches. On Halloween, Lawford finally gets tenure, and comes home to celebrate with his family. He even\r\nconvinces his wife to let him take Charlie to a late-night Halloween parade (do\r\nthose things really happen in NYC in 2015?) Charlie, who has been having odd visions\r\nof late, asks dad if they \u201ccan pay the\r\nghost,\u201d and abruptly disappears. A year later, Mike and Kristen have been torn apart by the\r\ndisappearance of their son, and start to have supernatural visions, including\r\nhearing a child screaming and seeing Charlie on a bus. Is Charlie trying to\r\ncommunicate to them from the other side? With a laughably small amount of\r\nresearch, Mike notices that while children who go missing are often found,\r\nthose who disappear on All Hallow\u2019s Eve rarely come home again. Someone, or\r\nsomething, is abducting kids on October 31st, and many of the\r\nguardians of the abductees tell the same story of the titular phrase being said\r\njust before they disappeared. Who is the ghost that must be paid? What must he\r\nor she be paid with? Does this have something to do with Cage\u2019s notorious IRS\r\nproblems? It\u2019s amazing how long \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d drags itself through a feature-length running time with almost nothing to speak of in terms of plot.\r\nCharlie disappears, and dad looks for him. The set-up is a slog, as we know\r\nthere\u2019s no movie without dad making contact with his son again, and there\u2019s\r\nabsolutely no style or character to get us over the lack of narrative suspense.\r\nCage doesn\u2019t even give it his wide-eyed all; he\u2019s more fun in \u201cLeft Behind.\u201d\r\nPerhaps presuming that director Uli Edel would actually dramatically ground \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d\r\nin something relatable, Cage actually plays it straight, which eliminates any\r\nB-movie fun that could even be had with this misstep. If you\u2019re going to do a\r\nlackluster horror movie just for the money, at least try and have some fun with\r\nit. Advertisement Instead, \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d does nothing that we haven\u2019t seen\r\ndone more entertainingly and incisively in other films. It literally has two\r\ncharacters at the 70-minute mark explain the entire narrative\u2014where Charlie is,\r\nhow to save him, why he was taken, etc.\u2014in back-to-back conversations. It is\r\nthe apex of lazy screenwriting. At one point, Lawford notes to his class that Washington Irving established the tone of his infamous piece \"Sleepy Hollow\" with just its name. So does \u201cPay the Ghost.\u201d It\u2019s to Pay the Bills.", "Critic": "Beta"}
