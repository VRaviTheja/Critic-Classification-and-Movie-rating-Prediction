{"Title": "Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cRumble,\u201d the guitar instrumental recorded by Link Wray in 1957, is to modern rock music what the monolith was to those primates in the \u201cDawn of Man\u201d section of \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d If you\u2019re ever on a quest for The Thing Itself in amplified music, \u201cRumble\u201d is a convincer. Sure, Chuck Berry invented licks and riffs and a worldview that invented \u201crock n roll,\u201d but Wray, with a surly distorted tone that one-upped the broken-amplifier crackle of Ike Turner\u2019s axe on \u201cRocket 88,\u201d helped invent \u201crock.\u201d Hendrix, hard rock, heavy metal all owe him big.  Advertisement He\u2019s the launching pad for this movie about Native Americans (here called \u201cIndians\u201d for reasons that become clearer as the movie goes on) and their influence not just on rock but on American music. As is pointed out more than once, the music of the Shawnee, the Choctaw, the Mohawk, the Apache, and so many other tribes, is in a very real sense the first American music. Race-mixing between blacks and Indians resulted in a cultural consciousness that enabled a melding of African music and Indian. Among other things, the movie makes a convincing case that the Indian tradition was one explicitly drawn upon by Charlie Patton, one of the giants of Delta Blues. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. The movie, directed by Catherine Bainbridge with Alfonso Maiorana, begins with Wray. And the section devoted to him is actually the weakest one in the movie. As if wanting to convince the viewer as to its authoritativeness, it mixes scintillating archival footage of the badass guitarist, from clean-cut-with-pomaded-hair \u201850s incarnation to leather-clad \u201870s Gibson SG mangler with a parade of talking heads talking about how significant \u201cRumble\u201d was. I enjoy hearing from Steven Van Zandt, the MC5\u2019s Wayne Kramer, Slash, music critic David Fricke et. al. as much as the next enthusiast, but after a while I\u2019m thinking, \u201cInstead of talking so much about \u2018Rumble,\u2019 how about letting us actually HEAR more of it?\u201d  It\u2019s also peculiar that the movie drops Wray pretty much right after giving us the news that \u201cRumble\u201d was banned from a host of radio stations, a signal accomplishment for an instrumental. \u201cThe theme song of juvenile delinquency,\u201d Van Zandt says, delightedly. Wray\u2019s subsequent career was as action-packed and eccentric as any rock figure you can name, and it doesn\u2019t get played out here. Maybe they\u2019re saving it for a separate documentary.  But the stories the film tells after Wray\u2019s are mostly well-done and frequently moving mini-movies. A section in New Orleans, featuring local hero Monk Boudreaux and several members of the Neville Brothers, is a superb pr\u00e9cis of the roots of that region\u2019s infectious music. Buffy Sainte Marie speaks of becoming a musician by happenstance, and suffering under a blacklist she wasn\u2019t even explicitly aware of for almost twenty years. Robbie Robertson recount his procession from journeyman teen guitarist to Bob Dylan\u2019s wingman during his controversial switch from folk to rock. \u201cBe proud you\u2019re an Indian but be careful who you tell,\u201d he recalls his people advising him. The movie also examines the Indian roots in the work of Mildred Bailey, a pioneer for female jazz singers and a profound influence on some male superstars who came after her, one of whom, Tony Bennett, appears in an interview.  Advertisement And there are heartbreaking stories, especially the one of Jessie Ed Davis, the spectacular guitar player who worked with blues singer Taj Mahal in the \u201960s. Allman Brothers Band member Butch Trucks recently told an interviewer that one reason the band long declined to put a studio recording of its rendition of \u201cStatesboro Blues\u201d on an album was they felt it was just a second-string copy of what Taj and Davis had done on their first album. Davis\u2019 adoption by British rockers led to a high life that unfortunately plunged Davis into junkiedom. Cleaned up, Davis teamed with Native American activist and poet John Trudell for the great \u201cAKA Grafitti Man\u201d project. In the film, Trudell (who was interviewed prior to his own 2015 passing) says of Davis, \u201cHe set me on my way, and then he checked out.\u201d  The movie goes down byways you might not have expected: Taboo from Black Eyed Peas makes an appearance, and heavy metal shows up via both guitarist Steve Salas (one of the movie\u2019s executive producers) and drummer Randy Castillo, who played with Ozzy. Their stories are among the movie\u2019s most moving. Appropriately, \u201cRumble\u201d ends at Standing Rock, North Dakota, with the sight of indigenous people protesting the Keystone pipeline, confronted by faceless authority figures who look ready to beat them down. The struggle continues. \u201cWe\u2019re right and the world is wrong,\u201d as Robertson said he came to believe in the period when he and Bob Dylan were practically getting booed off the stage every night.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
