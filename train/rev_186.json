{"Title": "Abortion: Stories Women Tell", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Watching HBO\u2019s \u201cAbortion:\r\nStories Women Tell,\u201d which gets a limited theatrical release this week before an\r\nairing on the network, I was struck by how many documentaries on the subject I\u2019ve\r\nseen in just the last few years. And I was struck even more by the variety in\r\ntheir approach: \u201cTrapped\u201d focuses on the laws that are essentially making\r\nabortion illegal in several states; The excellent \u201cAfter Tiller\u201d looks at the\r\nfew doctors left willing to perform third-trimester abortions and the danger\r\nthey face to do what they think is right. \u201cAbortion: Stories Women Tell\u201d has a clear focus that's right there in its title: approaching the subject from the women with\r\nfirst-hand experience. In an interesting twist, director Tracy Droz Tragos\r\ndoesn\u2019t only speak to the women who have chosen to have abortions but people\r\nlike the security guard at the clinic (nicknamed Chi Chi because she\u2019s small\r\nand feisty like a Chihuahua) and even those on the other side of the issue,\r\nincluding prominent female voices in the pro-life organization 40 Days For\r\nLife. But what\u2019s essential about Tragos\u2019 film is that the male voices we hear\r\nare almost exclusively on the fringe: men in the parking lot of a clinic\r\nyelling about Jesus or lawmakers trying to essentially subvert Roe v. Wade.\r\nThis is an issue about women\u2019s rights and so this powerful film exclusively listens to the stories\r\nthat women tell.\u00a0 Advertisement Some of those stories\r\nare among the most resonant I\u2019ve heard in a documentary this year. Particularly\r\nmemorable is the tale of Amie, a young woman who simply can\u2019t afford to have another baby\r\nas she already works multiple jobs to keep her child fed as it is. Several of\r\nthe people we meet in \u201cAbortion: Stories Women Tell\u201d are in this situation:\r\nknowing that their family will go hungry if there\u2019s another mouth to feed.\r\nOthers are in that tragic position in which they\u2019ve learned that their\r\nbaby won\u2019t survive after birth. Others are in abusive relationships. A\r\nwoman tells a heartbreaking tale of being with such an abusive partner that she\r\nknew bringing a baby into the situation would only put her child\u2019s safety at\r\nrisk. It\u2019s important to realize, although Tragos doesn\u2019t underline this fact,\r\nthat every story is different. Money, health, abuse\u2014everyone has a reason, and\r\ndespite what pro-life proponents would have you believe, none of those reasons\r\nfeel poorly-considered. \u201cAbortion: Stories Women\r\nTell\u201d takes an interesting turn when it crosses the aisle, presenting\r\ninterviews with people trying to shut down clinics in Missouri (which they have\r\nessentially done, sending women who need abortions over state lines to the more\r\nlenient Illinois). Tragos\u2019 allegiance is clear, but these films often falter\r\nwhen they demonize the opponent, and hearing a woman honestly speak about how\r\nshe believes she\u2019s saving lives when she protests abortion clinics highlights\r\nthe complexity of the issue. She doesn\u2019t have any doubt that\r\nwhat she\u2019s doing is right. And Tragos\u2019 film is at its best when it\u2019s interested\r\nin commonality. There\u2019s a great moment in which a woman who works at the\r\nIllinois clinic where most of the film takes place sings along to protestors\r\nwith \u201cJesus Loves Me.\u201d One of the last lines of the film is \u201cDo what you think\r\nis right.\u201d So many people involved with the war for the right to legal and safe\r\nabortions and those against them are\r\ndoing what they think is right. While \u201cAbortion: Stories\r\nWomen Tell\u201d strengthens its clear pro-choice stance by allowing the other side\r\nsome time in front of the camera, it is not an overtly political film. We learn\r\nabout the dynamic along this Midwestern border, in which one state has TRAP laws so tough that it pushes women in need to another, and that naturally\r\ncarries some political baggage, but it is the women and their stories that\r\nmatter. It is the faces, particularly Amie\u2019s incredible courage and humanity to\r\nlet us share a very difficult journey with her, that people will remember. And\r\nthat\u2019s why these films keep getting made, and keep mattering to viewers. As people\r\ndebate the issue in presidential campaigns, it is the world of the documentary\r\nthat reminds us what this issue is really about: Women. Listen to their stories.
