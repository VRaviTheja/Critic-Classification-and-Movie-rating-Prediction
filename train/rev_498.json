{"Title": "A War", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "This Danish movie opens with a scene of high tension that\r\nsoon situates the viewer exactly where he or she would never want to be. In\r\nAfghanistan, a group of Danish peacekeepers is scouring a patch of barren land,\r\nwalking in a narrow, evenly-spaced line. The better not to get blown up by a\r\nland mine. Their work is methodical. The soldiers are in constant contact with\r\ntheir base, and its commanders and intel officers are providing calm, expert\r\nguidance. But of course something bad is going to happen. And something bad\r\ndoes happen, and the consequences weigh heavily on the commanding officer,\r\nClaus Pedersen. Out of a sense of guilt, and more overtly to make up for the\r\nabsence of a shell-shocked soldier whom he\u2019s decided to put on camp patrol,\r\nPedersen begins accompanying his troops on their away-from-base rounds. He\r\ndoesn\u2019t know it, but he\u2019s setting himself up for a fall.  Advertisement I\u2019m being\r\ndeliberately vague about the plot points of this gut-churning movie, written\r\nand directed by Tobias Lindholm, it\u2019s because I truly believe, beyond any kind\r\nof \u201cspoiler-alert\u201d preemptive service-journalism second-guessing, that this is\r\na movie best experienced more or less cold. Pedersen, beautifully portrayed by\r\nPilou Asb\u00e6k, is a good man\u2014a large portion of the movie\u2019s first half crosscuts\r\nbetween him and his wife and kids in Denmark, and his devotion and care is\r\nalmost palpable\u2014and arguably a good soldier. But what does it actually mean to\r\nbe a \u201cgood soldier?\u201d \u201cA War\u201d asks this question in an understated but\r\nunambiguous way. The movie could take this ever-pertinent quote from Ernest\r\nHemingway as its motto: \u201cNever think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how\r\njustified, is not a crime.\u201d Once Pedersen and his troops are lured, in a\r\ncompletely appalling way, into a brutal ambush, Pedersen takes action that ends\r\nup curtailing his tour of duty, calling him back to Denmark to answer for a war\r\ncrime, weighing his own conscience against the dry dictates of a defense\r\nattorney who flatly tells him, \u201cI\u2019m here to create acquittals, not deal with\r\nmoral or ethical questions.\u201d This is a\r\nmovie where it\u2019s extremely helpful to\r\npay attention, especially during the ambush scene, because Lindholm places the\r\nviewer in a noisy, confusing predicament along with the soldiers. It\u2019s\r\ndifficult to keep track of what\u2019s going on, let alone make an assessment of\r\nwhat you yourself would do in Pedersen\u2019s place. And again, the consequences of\r\nwhat Pedersen DOES do are nothing less than appalling. Which side are you on?\r\nWhich side is the movie on? Asb\u00e6k\u00a0is such an appealing actor, and the smirks\r\nand pouts of the movie\u2019s prosecuting magistrate Lisbeth Danning, played by Charlotte Munck, are\r\nportrayed as on the petulant side, but even here the movie maintains an even\r\nhand: her arguments are cogent, sane, humanitarian, not wrong. The quiet\r\nauthority Lindholm brings to the portrayal of all the aspects of the story\u2014the\r\nsoldiering, the camaraderie, the domestic travails of Pedersen\u2019s wife as she\r\nmanages the mutating behaviors of their three young children, the bland yet\r\nimposing officiousness of the military tribunal\u2014is exemplary, and puts me in\r\nmind of the definite but unimposing style of the Iranian filmmaker Asghar\r\nFarhadi, who deals with not entirely similar but nonetheless extremely fraught\r\nmoral conundrums. \u201cA War,\u201d as tough to watch as it can be, is an extremely\r\nrewarding and disquieting experience.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
