{"Title": "Addicted to Fresno", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "\u201cAddicted to Fresno\u201d is such a mean-spirited, dull and silly\r\nmovie that it buries its talented cast under the weight of a horrendous script\r\nthat they can\u2019t possibly redeem. Much like the recent \u201cStaten Island Summer,\u201d it\u2019s a \u201ccomedy\u201d\r\nwith a great ensemble given almost nothing funny to do. Similar to that film, it\r\nmakes one wonder why so many actors and actresses who should know they\u2019re above\r\nthis material chose not to be for a few weeks of filming. My guess is that the\r\ninvolvement of Jamie Babbitt propelled them to sign on the bottom line, as they\r\nlikely worked with the excellent TV director on \u201cMarried,\u201d \u201cGirls,\u201d \u201cPlaying\r\nHouse,\u201d \u201cDrop Dead Diva,\u201d \u201cUnited States of Tara,\u201d \u201cThe Middle\u201d or a dozen\r\nother hit shows. Babbitt is generally a confident, capable TV director, but she\r\ncan\u2019t rescue Karey Dornetto\u2019s script from its misanthropic foundation. This is\r\na film mostly populated by awful people doing awful things that awful people\r\nonly do in awful movies.  Advertisement Shannon (Judy Greer) has moved in with her sister Martha\r\n(Natasha Lyonne) after running away from rehab for sex addiction. She\u2019s also\r\nbeen forced to get a job at the same hotel at which Martha works, run by\r\nKristen (Jessica St. Clair), and where she meets Martha\u2019s friendly co-worker\r\nEric (Malcolm Barrett). Meanwhile, Shannon is sleeping with her married\r\ntherapist Edwin (Ron Livingston) while Martha struggles with a recent break-up\r\nand ignores the advances of Kelly (Aubrey Plaza), who\u2019s clearly romantically\r\ninterested.  What starts as a character dramedy a la \u201cSunshine Cleaning\u201d\r\nbecomes something much different when Shannon decides to have quickie sex with\r\na hotel guest (Jon Daly), and Martha bursts in on them. Shannon cries rape,\r\nMartha moves to defend her sister, and the guy ends up dead. Now, the sisters\r\nhave to dispose of a body, which actually takes this sitcom-ish story to a\r\ncrematorium and a Bar Mitzvah that the girls choose to rob. Molly Shannon, Fred\r\nArmisen, Kumail Nanjiani and Alison Tolman co-star in small roles. All should\r\nhave known better. There are so many unlikable characters and blatantly Look At\r\nHow Edgy We Are joke topics here that it\u2019s hard to keep track\u2014rape, addiction,\r\nmurder, dementia, Down\u2019s Syndrome, etc. Do you find these things inherently\r\nhilarious? \u201cAddicted to Fresno\u201d is for you. Using this kind of\r\nmaterial for humor is certainly not impossible, but it does demand a difficult tonal balance\r\nthat Dornetto can\u2019t manage. It\u2019s more often gross and off-putting than funny.\r\nIt\u2019s like a stand-up comedian trying out their new, edgy material to the sound of\r\nclinking glasses and hearty sighs. Do you think an old woman in a birthday hat\r\nin a wheelchair saying \u201cpoopy\u201d is funny? Do you know anyone who does? If so,\r\nyou may want to find new friends. Advertisement The cast is so talented that \u201cAddicted to Fresno\u201d gets more\r\ndepressing as you realize how much they\u2019re going to be wasted. There are a few\r\nmoments in which that talent shines through\u2014the first scene between Greer &\r\nShannon, a funny bit with Nanjiani, Armisen & Tolman\u2019s first scene\u2014but they\u2019re\r\nalmost instantly buried by material that falls flat. By the time the girls are\r\nplanning to boost gifts from a Bar Mitzvah, my brain had completely checked out\r\nand gone somewhere more interesting, safer, and funnier.", "Critic": "Beta"}
