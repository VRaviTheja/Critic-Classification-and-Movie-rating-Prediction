{"Title": "Mechanic: Resurrection", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Usually, when a studio declines to screen a movie for\r\nreviewers, the reflexive assumption is that the picture is a dog. This largely\r\nturns out to be true, but not always. As for \u201cMechanic: Resurrection,\u201d the disinclination of\r\nLionsgate to present it to viewers was a little puzzling in a different\r\nrespect. Sure, the 2011 film \u201cThe Mechanic,\u201d a Jason Statham/Ben Foster starring remake\r\nof the 1972 Charles Bronson/Jan-Michael Vincent master hitman thriller, only\r\ngot a 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but I thought it was pretty okay,\r\nand that\u2019s all that counts. Given that the sequel pairs off Statham\u2019s\r\nimplacable best-of-the-best anonymous assassin with charming genre movie mascot\r\nJessica Alba, and has Tommy Lee Jones third-billed or so, with Hong Kong\r\neminence Michelle Yeoh rounding out the supporting cast, well, how bad could it\r\nbe? Advertisement Not good, is the answer, learned at an early Thursday\r\nevening screening. Despite some of the most picturesque locations money can\r\nbuy, and some not unimpressive looking movable props (yachts with helipads and\r\nsuch) and so on, \u201cMechanic: Resurrection\u201d suffers from a storyline and script\r\nthat strains credulity and insults intelligence even by the low bar set by the\r\nmajority of contemporary action movies.\u00a0 The picture opens with Statham\u2019s Arthur Bishop\r\ncomfortably ensconced, \u00e0 la Travis McGee, on a houseboat in Rio. The steadiness\r\nof the houseboat is such that Bishop, now known as Santos, can rock out with a\r\nvinyl turntable. But not for long. Lunching at his favorite cliffside outdoor\r\nrestaurant, he\u2019s approached by a femme fatale who Knows Who He Really Is, and\r\nwho tells him her \u201cPrincipal\u201d wants him to kill three targets. Santos/Bishop\u2019s\r\nviolent refusal to play ball is met with an attack by a small military\r\nbattalion\u2019s worth of men. Not only does this action sequence fail to build a\r\nhead of steam, but the lack of logic is a little startling. I need you to kill\r\nthese men for me, because only you can do it, and if you refuse, I will kill\r\nyou myself. Spot the flaw in this thinking.  Bishop of course escapes, and regroups at a seaside village\r\nin Thailand, watched over by old pal Mei, played by Yeoh. Soon enough a honey\r\ntrap with Alba as the bait makes itself known. But Alba\u2019s not a villainess. Her\r\ncharacter, Gina, is being extorted in a sense by supervillain Crain, a bland\r\nSam Hazeldine. If Gina doesn\u2019t play ball, Crain\u2019s going to torch the Cambodian\r\norphanage at which Gina is a beloved fixture. Yes, you read that right.  Tending to Gina\u2019s wounds in one scene, Mei says to her\r\npatient, \u201cMy father was a doctor of Eastern medicine. He was a healer.\u201d Well,\r\nyes, I would hope so. Later in the movie, Gina says to Bishop, \u201cThose kids are\r\neverything to me. If they get trafficked or killed I just couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d\r\nBishop responds, \u201cI was an orphan too.\u201d Wow. This isn\u2019t just a character note:\r\nit\u2019s a plot point. Crain was a childhood friend of Bishop back at the\r\norphanage. This wasn\u2019t particularly convincing in the last James Bond film and\r\nit works even less here, although if you choose to buy it you may wonder what\r\nit is with British orphanages that make them turn out such efficient killers.\r\nThere\u2019s also the matter of the phrasing of the dialogue itself. \u201cIf they get\r\ntrafficked or killed\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly roll off the tongue. Alba is an\r\nappealing screen presence (and director Daniel Gansel takes some advantage of\r\nthis with a few beach-set shots of the sort that they used to call\r\n\u201ccheesecake\u201d). She is not the most virtuoso actor, but not even Meryl Streep\r\ncould make such dialogue sing.  It\u2019s kind of perplexing: clearly not too much expense was\r\nspared in the beautiful locations and blow-stuff-up effects tech. Writers in\r\nevery industry come cheaper and cheaper these days; surely the producers could\r\nhave invested some of their financing in a script with more\r\ninventiveness and engagement power than the one they had on set. Of\r\ncourse, this still would have left the uninspired direction of Gansel. Might\r\nhe have delivered something more enjoyable with better material? We\u2019ll never\r\nknow. As for Tommy Lee Jones, his role as a roguish arms dealer is not much more than\r\na cameo, for which he chooses to repeat many of the performing riffs he\r\nworked to good effect way way back in 1992\u2019s \u201cUnder Siege,\u201d the elemental but\r\nenjoyable action film that kind of made Jones into a big star. His work here is\r\none of two pieces of wit the movie has to offer; the other is courtesy of production designers Sebastian T. Krawinkel and Antonello Rubino, who\r\nplace a replica of the sculpture in the Mosfilm logo title shot in the\r\nrepository of Soviet kitsch that serves as Jones\u2019 character\u2019s panic room.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
