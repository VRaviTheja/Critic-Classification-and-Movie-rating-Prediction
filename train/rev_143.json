{"Title": "White Bird in a Blizzard", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Gregg Araki is no stranger to teen angst and provocative\r\nfilmmaking. For the last 25 years, Araki has been seemingly obsessed with the\r\nyears of sexual exploration and teenage rebellion in works like \u201cThe Doom\r\nGeneration,\u201d \u201cNowhere\u201d and \u201cKaboom.\u201d He has always been an interesting,\r\nunderrated voice in cinema (and helped reveal the dramatic depth of Joseph\r\nGordon-Levitt in his best film, \u201cMysterious Skin.\u201d) Which is what makes \u201cWhite\r\nBird in a Blizzard\u201d a true oddity in his filmography in that it\u2019s one of the\r\nfew times, arguably the only time, that he\u2019s made a film that\u2019s dull.\r\nTypically, when Araki misses the mark, he misses wildly and with fascinating\r\naplomb. \u201cWhite Bird,\u201d despite the best efforts of stars Shailene Woodley and\r\nEva Green, is flat when it should be edged; something I never thought I\u2019d say\r\nabout the man who made a movie called \u201cTotally Fucked Up.\u201d  Advertisement It is the Fall of 1988, and Kat Connor (Woodley) is about to\r\nhave her life turned upside down. Well, sorta. Working from a book by Laura\r\nKasischke that one presumes lacks the melodrama other writers would have\r\nlayered into a story about the destruction of a teenage girl\u2019s family, Araki\r\ntreats his subject matter with a heady dose of apathy. Kat\u2019s mother, the\r\nflamboyant Eve (Eva Green), just up and disappears one day. Kat suspects that\r\nher boyfriend Phil (Shiloh Fernandez) may know more about the disappearance\r\nthan he lets on, and the cops, led by Detective Scieziesciez (Thomas Jane),\r\nsuspect dear old dad (Christopher Meloni), of course. But the \u201cmystery\u201d of Eve\u2019s\r\ndisappearance is never front and center in \u201cWhite Bird in a Blizzard.\u201d To be\r\nhonest, little is front and center. Kat meanders through the hazy days after\r\nher mom\u2019s disappearance, we get a few flashbacks and then the film jumps\r\nforward for a final chapter. And that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not suggesting that all films need a grand purpose, but \u201cWhite\r\nBird in a Blizzard\u201d doesn\u2019t work as mystery or character study. It\u2019s a melting\r\npot of themes that have not only been handled more interestingly in recent\r\nyears but have been handled more interestingly within its own director\u2019s\r\nfilmography\u2014murder, apathy, obsession, sex and intrigue in suburbia. Parts of\r\nit play broad like satire, as if Araki is doing a riff on \u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d\r\nbut too much of it sits there, almost as if Araki isn't excited by the material he's been given. Not all of it just \"sits there,\" however. As they often are, Araki\u2019s music\r\nchoices are clever, and I\u2019m happy to have lived long enough to have seen an\r\nextended dance scene to Depeche Mode\u2019s \u201cBehind the Wheel.\u201d And Woodley, as she\r\nso often does, grounds the film in something genuine. She has such a natural,\r\nin-the-moment presence that she keeps us interested in Kat\u2019s arc even when the storytelling\r\ndoesn\u2019t. And then there\u2019s Eva. Eva Green turns Eve into a character Joan\r\nCrawford would have told to tone it down. She is larger than life, desperate to\r\nbe the most important person in the room. And \u201cWhite Bird\u201d is at its most\r\ninteresting when Green is allowed to play the dark soul of a woman shattered by\r\nthe realization that her daughter was suddenly more interesting than she was.\r\nGreen is fantastic here, truly memorable in just a few scenes. Sadly, she\r\ncouldn\u2019t be in all of them. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
