{"Title": "Clouds of Sils Maria", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Depending on where you sit, this movie\u2019s a draw for very\r\ndifferent reasons. From the mainstream perspective, two words: Kristen Stewart.\r\nThe young actor, who catapulted to worldwide fame in the \u201cTwilight\u201d series,\r\nhas, like her co-star Robert Pattinson, been using the clout that such stardom\r\nbrings to effectively branch out as a performer. In the contemporary movie\r\nbusiness, the transaction works both ways: big young star stretches creative\r\nmuscles by signing on to challenging, filmmaker-driven projects; challenging,\r\nfilmmaker-driven projects get their financing because a young star who wants to\r\nstretch his or her creative muscles has signed on to it. In cases like those of\r\nPattinson\u2019s and Stewart\u2019s, the stakes, and the intrigue, get raised, because\r\nboth performers have wildly enthusiastic (not to say rabid) fan bases that seem\r\nwilling to follow their idols anywhere. Which is not to say that movies like\r\n\u201cMaps To The Stars\u201d (Pattinson working for the second time with maestro of\r\nunsettling content David Cronenberg) or this Stewart co-starrer are fated to\r\nrack up \u201cTwilight\u201d-comparable numbers. But they will be seen by a segment of\r\nthe mass audience that in most other circumstances isn\u2019t interested in auteurs.\r\nThe Stewart-intrigue factor is in itself a double-edged sword, because for\r\nevery 10,000 growing teens for whom Stewart can do no wrong, there\u2019s one film critic,\r\namateur or professional, who still is not sure if Stewart \u201ccan act.\u201d (I am not\r\none of these; I was impressed by her in \u201cPanic Room,\u201d \u201cUndertow,\u201d and \u201cInto The\r\nWild,\u201d to name three of her pre-\u201cTwilight\u201d films.) They look to films such as\r\nthis one, and another recent Stewart indie, \u201cCamp X-Ray,\u201d to settle the\r\nquestion for them once and for all.  Advertisement Then there are those for whom this movie\u2019s a draw because of\r\nits writer/director, Olivier Assayas, working here not just with Stewart but\r\nwith the great French actress Juliette Binoche, who was also in Assayas\u2019\r\nterrific 2008 family drama \u201cSummer Hours.\u201d Assayas is one of world cinema\u2019s\r\nmost penetrating and unpredictable talents; for instance, the two films he made\r\nprior to this one were \u201cSomething In The Air,\u201d an affecting, autobiographical\r\ncoming-of-age story of politics and cinema in the early \u201870s, and before that,\r\nthe sweeping, bracing, not-at-all-sweet \u201cCarlos,\u201d a trenchant biopic of the\r\ntitular real-life terrorism perpetrator whose activities galvanized Europe for\r\na period. \u201cClouds of Sils Maria\u201d is entirely different in some ways from those\r\ntwo films, but its invented worlds are very much in keeping with Assayas\u2019\r\nconcerns about how art and reality intertwine and feed off of each other.  The setup for the picture seems to promise a story of\r\nrivalry among artists: the movie begins on a train; world-renowned actress\r\nMaria (Binoche) is on her way to visit her artistic mentor Wilhelm Melchior,\r\nand deliver a speech at a ceremony honoring the reclusive theater master. Maria\r\nhas her efficient but frazzled and very hip young American assistant Val\r\n(Stewart) in tow; Val\u2019s the one in charge of the schedules, the multiple\r\nsmartphones, and the texting, and it\u2019s Val who first learns that Melchior, the\r\nman they\u2019re on their way to see, has died.  This loss changes the dynamic of the event. Maria has barely\r\ntime to register her loss than she\u2019s regaled with Chanel in a theater corridor;\r\nwhisked through a photo shoot; reintroduced to a former co-star she never\r\nliked; and approached by a hot young theater director to appear in a revival of\r\nthe Melchior play that made her famous. Playing, and this is no small thing,\r\nnot the ing\u00e9nue role that she is now to old for, but the role of an older, more\r\nembittered character. Set to play the younger woman\u2019s role is of course a\r\nyounger woman, a scandal-riddled star played by Chloe Grace Moretz and\r\ninitially seen mainly via paparazzi videos Val finds for Maria on YouTube.\r\nAfter this flurry of activity Val and Maria repair to Melchior\u2019s house in the\r\ntitle village. It\u2019s not far from this place that a particular cloud formation\r\ncalled the Maloja Snake, which provides the Melchior play with its own title,\r\noccurs. Aside from feeding each other lines from Melchior\u2019s play, and arguing\r\nabout life and art and career, Maria and Val aspire to go on a hike and witness\r\nthe snake-like cloud formation as it appears. In the meanwhile, elsewhere in\r\nEurope, Jo-Ann (Moretz) and her latest male conquest, a boy toy with literary\r\npedigree, hone in on, you might have guessed it, an opportunity to stretch\r\ncreative muscles and/or gain some form of artistic cred; for whatever reason,\r\nJo-Ann is hungry for a form of respectability even if she can\u2019t quite fathom\r\nwhat kind, not to even mention why.  Advertisement In pr\u00e9cis form this material looks like an unlikely walk\r\ninto \u201cAll About Eve\u201d territory for Assayas, only with more self-reflexivity.\r\nBut in spite of the superficial dynamics of the\r\nyoung-actress-meets/conquers-older-star scenario, which are fully acknowledged,\r\n\u201cClouds of Sils Maria\u201d is oodles more poetic and enigmatic than the term\r\n\u201cbackstage drama\u201d generally encompasses. It isn\u2019t a story of predatory ambition\r\nor women stabbing each other in the back; all the characters in the movie have\r\ntheir reasons, but the film, at least in the show business aspects of its\r\nstory, is concerned with the paradox of self-preservation within an enterprise\r\nthat requires you have to invest your trust with so many other people. Artistic\r\ncreation begins in the first person singular, but then turns plural, and not\r\neveryone who gets on board makes it all the way to the end of the trip. To that\r\nend, Assayas executes a gambit in the final fifth of the movie that makes\r\nmatters all the more enigmatic. It\u2019s almost as if the conflicts the film\r\ndepicts up until this point\u2014rendered in convincing, epigrammatic dialogue and\r\naction, performed with sometimes searing conviction by Binoche and Stewart in\r\nparticular\u2014have suddenly been deemed too pat by the filmmaker. His way of\r\nshaking thing up is\u2026intriguing, for sure. It's one of those moves that make a second\r\nviewing worth contemplating. In any event, the pleasures of the acting and the\r\never-acute visuals are apt to make a second viewing a distinct pleasure, even\r\nif it doesn\u2019t solve anything.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
