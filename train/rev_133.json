{"Title": "Man Down", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "PTSD is a real, national crisis. It is something that is not openly discussed enough nor adequately handled by our government and those in charge of taking care of our veterans. The number of homeless vets and those suffering from PTSD in silence should be a priority for a country that wants to call itself civilized. None of these facts make Dito Montiel\u2019s \u201cMan Down\u201d a good film. Actually, the fact that it uses PTSD as a hook, as something to give its drama a sense of weight and importance that it doesn\u2019t otherwise earn, is one of its many problems. If you\u2019re going to make a film about PTSD, treat it with the respect it demands, not as a clich\u00e9d, melodramatic device. By doing so, one actually damages the cause they claim to be attempting to defend, turning something serious into something manipulative. \u201cMan Down\u201d is a bad film, but it\u2019s made even worse by the taste it will leave in your mouth regarding its silly handling of a very serious issue. Advertisement Montiel's latest takes place in what appears to be four separate periods in the life of Marine Gabriel Drummer (Shia LaBeouf). We see him with his buddy Devin (Jai Courtney) in a post-apocalyptic future, as the pair tries to track down Gabriel\u2019s son Johnathan (Charlie Shotwell), crossing paths with a drifter named Charles (Clifton Collins Jr.), who may know where the boy has been taken. The landscape they cross is desolate and empty. Where are they? What happened to Johnathan? What happened to everyone else? It's purposefully vague and confusing. We flash back to basic training, featuring scenes so dense with military clich\u00e9s they should have all been set to \u201cFortunate Son.\u201d Working slightly better as drama, we experience an extended conversation between Gabriel and a superior, played by Gary Oldman, that seems to take place after the young man has become a Marine but before the world ends. This scene as a whole is far and away the film's best as it escapes the plot and allows the two actors some semblance of character. Without it, the movie would verge on unbearable. And then we flash back further to Gabriel\u2019s life just before joining up, in which we meet his wife Natalie (Kate Mara) and enrich the bond between Gabriel and his son. The haphazard, choppy editing of \u201cMan Down\u201d is designed in such a way to replicate the confusion and twisted reality associated with PTSD, but its effect is opposite in that it feels entirely like cheap, manipulative devices instead of anything insightful about the human condition. \u201cMan Down\u201d is one of those scripts that plays games with viewer awareness, forcing us to ask what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not, and keeping a mystery what happened to Gabriel\u2019s son or while he was serving our country. Consequently, there are no real people in \u201cMan Down.\u201d There are no characters. There are merely cogs in the plot device machine.  Advertisement The sad thing is that LaBeouf does admirable work to try to correct for the lack of depth in Adam G. Simon and Montiel\u2019s script. He commits to the role completely, never betraying the film\u2019s shallowness or clich\u00e9s, and trying his best to find something worthwhile in terms of character. He makes some decisions in the extended scene with Oldman that totally work. He looks like a broken man, cracking from the inside out. There\u2019s a good LaBeouf performance buried deep in this film, and it almost makes the clich\u00e9s around it more frustrating because of the honest work they smother. Montiel has proven himself an interesting filmmaker when it comes to analyzing the alpha male in films like \u201cA Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\u201d and \u201cFighting,\u201d but he never figures out the right approach for \"Man Down.\" At times, the dialogue is so clich\u00e9d\u2014\u201cThis area\u2019s secure.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re at war, Marine. Nothing\u2019s secure.\u201d\u2014that it approaches parody, and I wondered if that wasn\u2019t intentional. There\u2019s a flashback in which the Marine buys his kid a puppy; the basic training scenes could have been written by a teenager who\u2019s seen too many military movies. And so on. Sadly, it\u2019s more likely just an example of people trying to handle a delicate, complex subject, but falling back on the devices instead of really tackling the material. Clich\u00e9s are easy. Manipulating audiences is easy. Really addressing a national crisis takes the kind of guts that \u201cMan Down\u201d just doesn\u2019t have.", "Critic": "Beta"}
