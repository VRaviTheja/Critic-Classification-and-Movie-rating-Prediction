{"Title": "Stratton", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "This movie opens with a bunch of texts extolling the badassery of the \u201cSpecial Boat Service,\u201d a branch of Britain\u2019s Royal Navy. The text has a certain needling quality; were it to have wound up saying \u201cTrust us, it\u2019s really badass,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be a bit surprised. We see the problem here. Unlike \u201cNavy SEALS,\u201d which has an intriguing ring to it right off the bat, \u201cSpecial Boat Service\u201d sounds like something you\u2019d call if you need a particularly swanky water taxi. \u201cStratton,\u201d then, is titled for a particularly badass member of Special Boat Service. It is based on a book by Duncan Falconer, which yes, is a pen name,\u00a0apparently, for a person who was once in the Special Boat Service and has written one non-fiction book about it and a bunch of Stratton novels about it. This movie is directed by Simon West, who as many people are fond of recalling, also directed \u201cCon Air,\u201d the 1997 action thriller that has accrued something resembling classic status over the past two decades. Apparently \u201cCon Air\u201d is enough to get some people\u2019s hopes up every time a new film directed by Simon West comes around. This wannabe franchise opener does not fulfill any hope, however. Advertisement After explaining Special Boat Service, the movie chronicles Dominic Cooper\u2019s Stratton on a mission in the Persian Gulf, particularly Iran\u2019s Strait of Hormuz. The bearded operative is joined by American partner Marty, stealthily raiding a chemical weapons plant while their remote support team keeps track of them. I don\u2019t watch the television series \u201cScorpion\u201d regularly, honest I don\u2019t, but this opener feels like an episode of that show with the \u201cwacky\u201d characters excised. That is, a tense woman in front of a computer (Gemma Chan) instructs Stratton and Marty as the \u201ctension\u201d mounts and the inevitable cry of \u201cWe have no choice! Just send in the chopper!\u201d is sounded.    Back home on his lonesome, Stratton licks his wounds on his houseboat, from which his now ex-girlfriend has disembarked. No worries: he has an eccentric hard-drinking neighbor (Derek Jacobi) on a neighboring boat. I think these guys are standard issue for British intelligence agents. Back at the office, Stratton reports to female boss Sumner, whose authority is immediately undercut for the viewer on account of her being portrayed on an elliptical exercise machine when Stratton walks in. There\u2019s all sorts of bad news. The guy who led an armed attack on Stratton and the now-absent Marty is a long-thought-dead Russian operative with whom Sumner (poor Connie Nielsen) was once romantically involved. Also, there\u2019s a mole in the SBS offices, whose identity you\u2019ll guess as soon as the actor who plays him walks into a frame. And there\u2019s a terrorist attack in the offing. Target: they don\u2019t know yet. Oh, wait, a little while later they find out. Oh, no. It\u2019s London.    This really is a paint-by-numbers action movie with two good things going for it. Those are brevity\u2014it\u2019s only 93 minutes long\u2014and immediate forgetability. This latter quality, I allow, is only considered good by a certain class of people, those who feel overly beleaguered. Given that this is a movie reaching our screens in a time when people are just plain tired, and perhaps dreading the travails of the year ahead, an aggressively unimposing movie such as this might not be the worst time-waster. But it\u2019s still a time-waster.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
