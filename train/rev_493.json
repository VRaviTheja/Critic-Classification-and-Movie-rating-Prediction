{"Title": "Interstellar", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Christopher\r\nNolan\u2019s\u00a0\"Interstellar,\" about astronauts traveling to the other end of the galaxy to find a new home to\r\nreplace humanity\u2019s despoiled home-world, is frantically busy and earsplittingly\r\nloud. It uses booming music to jack up the excitement level of scenes that\r\nmight not otherwise excite. It features characters shoveling exposition at each\r\nother for almost three hours, and a few of those characters have no character\r\nto speak of: they\u2019re mouthpieces for techno-babble and philosophical\r\ndebate. And for all of the director\u2019s activism on behalf of shooting on film,\r\nthe tactile beauty of the movie\u2019s 35mm and 65mm textures isn\u2019t matched by a sense of composition. The camera rarely tells the story in\r\nNolan\u2019s movies. More often it illustrates the screenplay, and there are\r\npoints in this one where I felt as if I was watching the most expensive NBC\r\npilot ever made. Advertisement And\r\nyet \"Interstellar\" is still an\r\nimpressive, at times astonishing movie that\r\noverwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted\r\naway. I\u2019ve packed the first paragraph of this review with those objections\r\n(they could apply to any Nolan picture post \"Batman\r\nBegins\"; he is who he is) so that people know that he\u2019s still doing the\r\nthings that Nolan always does. Whether you find those things endearing or\r\nirritating will depend on your affinity for Nolan's style.\u00a0 In any case, there\u2019s something pure and powerful about this movie.\u00a0I\r\ncan\u2019t recall a science fiction film hard-sold to a director\u2019s fans as multiplex-\u201cawesome\u201d\r\nin which so many major characters wept openly in close-up, voices breaking, tears streaming down\u00a0their\u00a0cheeks. Matthew\r\nMcConaughey\u2019s widowed astronaut Cooper and his colleague Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) pour\r\non the waterworks in multiple scenes, with justification: like everyone on the\r\ncrew of the Endurance, the starship\r\nsent to a black hole near Jupiter that will slingshot the heroes towards colonize-able worlds, they\u2019re separated from everything\r\nthat defines them: their loved ones, their personal histories, their culture,\r\nthe planet itself. Other characters\u2014including Amelia's father, an astrophysicist played by Michael Caine, and a space explorer (played by an\u00a0un-billed\u00a0guest actor) who\u2019s holed up on a forbidding\r\narctic world\u2014express a vulnerability to loneliness and\r\ndoubt that\u2019s quite raw for this director.\u00a0The film\u2019s central family (headed by Cooper, grounded after the\u00a0dismantling\u00a0of NASA) lives on a\u00a0corn\u00a0farm, for goodness\u2019 sake, like the gentle Iowans in \"Field of Dreams\"\u00a0(a film whose daddy-issues-laden story syncs up nicely with the narrative of\u00a0\"Interstellar\"). Granted, they're growing the crop to feed the human race, which is whiling away its twilight hours on a planet so ecologically devastated that at first you mistake it for the American Dust Bowl circa 1930 or so; but there's still something amusingly cheeky about the notion of corn as sustenance, especially in a survival story in which the future of humanity is at stake. (Ellen Burstyn plays one of many witnesses in a documentary first glimpsed in the movie's opening scene\u2014and which, in classic Nolan style, is a setup for at least two twists.)  The state-of-the-art sci-fi landscapes are deployed in service of Hallmark\r\ncard homilies about how people should live, and what\u2019s really important. (\"We love people who have died\u2014what's the social utility in that?\" \"Accident is the first step in evolution.\") After a\r\ncertain point it sinks in, or should sink in, that Nolan and his\r\nco-screenwriter, brother Jonathan Nolan, aren\u2019t trying to one-up the\r\nspectacular rationalism of \u201c2001.\" The movie's science fiction trappings are just a wrapping for a spiritual/emotional dream about basic human desires (for home, for family, for\r\ncontinuity of bloodline and culture), as well as for a horror film of sorts\u2014one that\r\ntreats the star voyagers\u2019 and their earthbound loved ones\u2019 separation as spectacular metaphors for what happens when the people we value are taken from us by death, illness, or unbridgeable distance. (\u201cPray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face,\u201d another astronaut says, after years alone in an interstellar wilderness.)\u00a0 While \"Interstellar\" never entirely commits to the idea of a non-rational, uncanny world, it nevertheless has a mystical strain, one that's unusually pronounced for a director whose storytelling has the right-brained sensibility of an engineer, logician, or accountant. There's\u00a0a ghost in this film, writing out messages to the\r\nliving in dust. Characters strain to\r\ninterpret distant radio messages as if they were ancient texts written in a\r\ndead language, and stare through red-rimmed eyes at video messages sent years ago, by people\r\non the other side of the cosmos. \"Interstellar\"\u00a0features a family haunted by the memory of a dead mother and then an absent father; a woman haunted by the memory of a missing father, and another woman who's separated from her own dad (and mentor), and driven to reunite with a lover separated from her by so many millions of miles that he might as well be dead.\u00a0 Advertisement With\r\nthe possible exception of the last act of \"Memento\"\u00a0and the pit sequence in \"The Dark Knight\r\nRises\"\u2014a knife-twisting hour that was all about suffering and transcendence\u2014I can\u2019t think of a Nolan film that ladles on\u00a0misery and\u00a0valorizes\u00a0gut feeling (faith)\u00a0the way this one does; not from start to finish, anyway. \u00a0The\u00a0most stirring sequences are less about driving the plot forward than contemplating what the characters' actions mean to them, and to us. The\u00a0best of these is the lift-off sequence, which starts with a countdown heard over images of Cooper leaving his family. It continues in space, with Caine reading passages from Dylan Thomas's villanelle \"Do Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night\": \"Old age should burn and rave at close of day;\u00a0Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\" (If it wasn't already obvious, this sequence certifies\u00a0Nolan as the most death-and-control obsessed major American filmmaker, along with Wes Anderson.) The film's widescreen panoramas feature harsh interplanetary landscapes, shot in cruel Earth locales; some of the largest and most\r\ndetailed starship miniatures ever built, and space sequences presented\r\nin scientifically accurate silence, a la \"2001.\" But for all its high-tech glitz, \"Interstellar\"\u00a0has a defiantly old-movie feeling. It's not afraid to switch, even lurch, between modes. At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes\r\nthe tough-tender spirit of a John Ford picture, or a Steven Spielberg film made\r\nin the spirit of a Ford picture: a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one. Bruising outer-space action sequences, with astronauts tumbling in zero gravity and striding across forbidding landscapes, give way to\u00a0snappy comic patter (mostly between Cooper and the ship's robot, TARS, designed in Minecraft-style, pixel-ish boxes, and voiced by Bill Irwin). There are long explanatory sequences, done with and without dry erase boards, dazzling vistas that are less spaces than mind-spaces, and tearful separations and reconciliations that might as well be played silent, in tinted black-and-white, and scored with a saloon piano. (Spielberg originated \"Interstellar\" in 2006, but dropped out to direct other projects.) McConaughey, a super-intense actor who wholeheartedly commits to every line and moment he's given, is the right leading man for this kind of film. Cooper proudly identifies himself as an engineer as well as an astronaut and farmer, but he has the soul of a goofball poet; when he stares at intergalactic vistas, he grins like a kid at an amusement park waiting to ride a new roller coaster. Cooper's farewell to his daughter Murph\u2014who's played by McKenzie Foy as a young girl\u2014is shot very close-in, and lit in warm, cradling tones; it has some of the tenderness of the porch swing scene in \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" When Murph grows up into Jessica Chastain\u2014a key member of Caine's NASA crew, and a surrogate for the daughter that the elder Brand \"lost' to the Endurance's mission\u2014we keep thinking about that goodbye scene, and how its anguish drives everything that Murph and Cooper are trying to do, while also realizing that similar feelings drive the other characters\u2014indeed, the rest of the species. (One suspects this is a deeply personal film for Nolan: it's about a man who feels he has been \"called\" to a particular job, and whose work requires him to spend long periods away from his family.) Advertisement The movie's storytelling masterstroke comes from adherence to principles of relativity: the astronauts perceive time differently depending on where Endurance is, which means that when they go down onto a prospective habitable world, a few minutes there equal weeks or months back on the ship. Meanwhile, on Earth, everyone is aging and losing hope. Under such circumstances, even tedious housekeeping-type exchanges become momentous: one has to think twice before arguing about what to do next, because while the argument is happening, people elsewhere are going grey, or suffering depression from being alone, or withering and dying. Here, more so than in any other Nolan film (and that's saying a lot), time is everything. \"I'm an old physicist,\" Brand tells Cooper early in the film. \"I'm afraid of time.\" Time is something we all fear. There's a \r\nticking clock governing every aspect of existence, from the global to \r\nthe familial. Every act by every character is an act of defiance, born \r\nof a wish to not go gently.", "Critic": "Delta"}
