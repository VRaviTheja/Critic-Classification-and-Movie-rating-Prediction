{"Title": "Dirty Grandpa", "Stars": 0.0, "Review": "A couple of weeks ago I had the strangest dream. I dreamed that this movie, \u201cDirty Grandpa,\u201d was the talk of the nation. Not because the Robert De Niro/Zac Efron/Aubrey Plaza raunch comedy was particularly good, but because, apparently\u2014I didn\u2019t see any of the movie in my dream, just had conversations with people about it\u2014it didn\u2019t do that thing that studio-produced-raunch comedies do, which is take things so far and no further. No. In my dream, \u201cDirty Grandpa\u201d was spinning heads because it broached John Waters/Harmony Korine levels of outrageousness. The sex scenes between De Niro and Plaza had a \u201cLast Tango In Paris\u201d level of explicitness, for instance.\u00a0 Advertisement Now you just have to take my word for it that I had this dream, but honestly, I did. The question is WHY did I have this dream. As the author of a book on De Niro, I\u2019m frequently (okay, not that frequently, but more often than would be the case for a guy who hadn\u2019t written a book on De Niro) asked what I make of his various career moves. So maybe the dream speaks to my critical desire to see De Niro go back to surprising his audiences with audacious performances. Or maybe I\u2019m just a perv who wants to see Aubrey Plaza naked. I don\u2019t know. The weird thing is, although the non-oneiric \u201cDirty Grandpa\u201d does not feature Aubrey Plaza naked (although she gets closer than one might have expected), the movie is, as in my dream, a genuine envelope-pusher. Its crudity is relentless. The subjects of its indifferently crafted and callously executed jokes include roofie-ing, crack smoking, child molestation, jailhouse rape, graphic depictions of penises in the shape of a swastika being displayed to a rabbi, and more. The sort of thing you might expect in a John Waters or Harmony Korine film.  Only in a John Waters or Harmony Korine film the jokes might be funny, or pointed. Here they are not. Early in the film\u2019s road trip, De Niro\u2019s horny patriarch is trying to charm some ladies on a golf course; on being stymied by uptight soon-to-be-married lawyer grandson Efron, he responds with a panoply of puns based on the term, if you\u2019ll excuse it, \u201ccock blocker.\u201d \u201cWho does your taxes, H. and R. Cockblock?\u201d De Niro asks Efron. He continues by making a salacious play on the name \u201cJack Nicklaus,\u201d putting a D where the N customarily is. Because they\u2019re at a golf course, get it? That De Niro delivers these moronic japes with gusto, even vehemence, does not improve them.\u00a0 The fact that the relentless barrage of this humor is occasionally punctuated with pointedly insincere homilies wherein \u201cdirty\u201d grandpa De Niro tries to encourage sellout grandson Efron to Follow His Dreams just makes the whole thing that more depressing. The other way the film pushes the envelope is through sheer, contemptuous incoherence. De Niro\u2019s character, Dick, is initially so homophobic and racist that one can actually imagine that he\u2019s a senior citizen Travis Bickle; having been domesticated for forty or so years, now on the death of his wife, he can let loose again, spewing epithets and rancor all the way from Georgia to Daytona Beach. Once Dick and Efron\u2019s Jason run into Jason\u2019s former college pal Shadia (Zoey Deutch, who here seems to be filling the function of \u201can Isla Fisher type\u201d) and her oversexed pal Lenore (Plaza) and their gay African-American pal Bradley (Jeffrey Bower-Champion), you can take a wild guess who ends up the brunt of Dick\u2019s dickish one-liners. Once the movie backs into a weird corner that skirts the hem of the infamous \u201cmind if we dance with your dates?\u201d scene in \u201cAnimal House,\u201d De Niro\u2019s character suddenly turns righteous in the ways of sexual tolerance even as he\u2019s humiliating a rougher black character. The movie\u2019s editing ADD is so severe that the aforementioned roofie-ing gag (actually a variation thereof, with Xanax substituting for Rohypnol, if anybody\u2019s counting) leads into a chugging-contest scene so incoherently edited that the joke, such as it is, has no payoff. As the wisecracking robots on \u201cMystery Science Theater 3000\u201d used to say, \u201cThey just didn\u2019t care.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement The movie is so incredibly consistent in failing to land an honest laugh that about an hour into it, its not being funny becomes laughable: I began giggling with a kind of metaphysical embarrassment for everyone involved in the enterprise, and, eventually, for all of humanity itself. I see, scrawled in my notebook, the words \u201cWhat is happening to our world?\u201d Weirdly enough, the final scene with Plaza and De Niro in the latter character\u2019s apartment does contain some rather good one-liners, which I have to assume were concocted by Plaza in an improv situation, as their verbal wit is so manifestly superior to any other spoken joke in the movie that the contrast is, again, embarrassing.\u00a0 The actor Bela Lugosi appeared in some landmark, perhaps even great, films at the beginning of his Hollywood career in the 1930s. They include Browning\u2019s \u201cDracula\u201d and Ulmer\u2019s \u201cThe Black Cat.\u201d Lugosi\u2019s final film was 1959\u2019s \u201cPlan 9 From Outer Space,\u201d frequently cited as the worst film ever made. The cinematic landmarks of De Niro\u2019s career include films such as Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Godfather, Part II\u201d and Scorsese\u2019s \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d He has been featured in a good number of very bad films in the years since. But this? This might just be his own \u201cPlan 9.\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}
