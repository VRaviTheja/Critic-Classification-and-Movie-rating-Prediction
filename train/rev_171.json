{"Title": "10 Cloverfield Lane", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Warning: As you may have guessed by its stealth production\r\n(no one really knew it existed before a trailer dropped), the less you know\r\nabout Dan Trachtenberg\u2019s \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d the better. It is a film that\r\nplays on forced perspective, keeping you in the dark about what exactly is\r\ngoing on. I will tread very lightly in the review to follow, but I won\u2019t be\r\nhurt if you want to click away right about now. Come back after you've seen it. \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d is a tight, tense thriller carried by\r\nexcellent performances from John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. It has\r\nechoes of Alfred Hitchcock and H.G. Wells embedded in a cat-and-mouse game\r\nafter the end of the world. Without directly acknowledging it in traditional\r\nblockbuster ways, it\u2019s a sequel to 2008\u2019s \u201cCloverfield,\u201d a found footage film\r\nabout an alien invasion. It\u2019s almost like a spin-off from that film, imagining\r\na different story taking place in a different part of the world but in the same\r\nuniverse. Whereas that movie jumped on a current trend in its approach (found\r\nfootage), Dan Trachtenberg\u2019s film feels much more old-fashioned in its style,\r\nrecalling genre pictures of the \u201850s and \u201860s. Trachtenberg and his team don\u2019t\r\nexplore some of the film\u2019s potential themes as deeply as I hoped they would and\r\nit\u2019s less visually engaging than it could have been. But this is rock-solid\r\nentertainment, a film meant to keep you guessing and jumping for 100 minutes\r\nbefore it throws you back into the world to argue about its ending. Advertisement Once in development under the name \u201cThe Cellar,\u201d the script\r\nby Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken (with a co-story credit by \u201cWhiplash\u201d\r\nwriter Damien Chazelle) was retrofitted to place it in the world of \u201cCloverfield.\u201d\r\nSo, as Michelle (Winstead) drives away from her life and partner, leaving her\r\nhouse keys and ring on the table, we hear ominous reports of power outages on\r\nthe coast over the radio. These opening scenes are clearly designed to be\r\nreminiscent of another story of a woman who left the city for a dangerous\r\ncountryside, as Michelle packing her bags and Bear McCreary\u2019s overheated,\r\nHermann-esque score will make anyone who\u2019s seen \"Psycho\" think of Marion Crane in the\r\nopening act of Hitchcock's classic. It\u2019s not long before Michelle finds her Norman Bates. After a terrifying car accident, Michelle wakes up in a\r\nbarren room, chained to the wall. She soon meets her captor, an imposing figure\r\nnamed Howard (John Goodman), although he claims to be more of a savior than a\r\nkidnapper. He saw Michelle\u2019s accident just as the sky exploded. There\u2019s been an\r\n\u201cevent\u201d outside, and he grabbed Michelle just in time to get her into the\r\nbunker he built for just such an occasion. It could be the Russians, the North\r\nKoreans or the Martians\u2014but, whatever it is, the air probably won\u2019t be\r\nbreathable for one or two years. And isn\u2019t Michelle lucky that they have enough\r\nfood, filtered air, and other supplies in this doomsday prepper\u2019s bunker to\r\nwait it out? They\u2019re not alone. Just before Howard closed the door, a\r\nneighbor named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) barged his way in as well. Emmett,\r\nwho has seen Howard building this bunker for just such an occasion, confirms\r\nenough of what Howard says that Michelle starts to believe. Well-played by the \"Short Term 12\" star, Emmett becomes a pivot point for the film, alternating between encouraging Michelle's fears and affirming that Howard is, at least in part, who he says he is. And when she sees\r\nsomething horrible after an aborted escape attempt, she resigns herself to the\r\nidea that these two men will be the last human beings she ever sees. But\r\nsomething\u2019s not right with Howard. He\u2019s controlling to an uncomfortable level,\r\nespecially when it comes to the dynamic between Michelle and Emmett. There\u2019s a\r\nfantastic scene of game-playing in which Howard\u2019s misogyny is laid on the\r\ntable, and the film keeps us guessing as to just what his intentions or end\r\ngame will be.  Advertisement That sense of unease is certainly there in the script and\r\nTrachtenberg deserves credit as well, but it\u2019s John Goodman\u2019s performance that makes\r\nyour skin crawl. He captures a man on the edge of sanity for whom control is\r\nkey. He\u2019s not an obvious maniac, as some other actors would have played the\r\nrole, but someone who honestly thinks he\u2019s a savior, and thinking that plays\r\ninto his control-freak God complex. Goodman keeps us guessing, allowing\r\nglimpses of the possibly kind man that Howard used to be before all of this\r\nhappened but even shading those in a sense of conditionality. Howard reminds\r\nMichelle and Emmett that he saved them so much that we start to wonder what he\u2019s\r\ngoing to expect in return. In terms of performance, the underrated Winstead matches\r\nGoodman in every way. So fantastic in \u201cSmashed\u201d and \u201cFaults,\u201d this is an\r\nactress who only gets a small portion of the attention she deserves. She\r\ncarries \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d conveying Michelle\u2019s conflicted feelings about\r\nher predicament and staying so completely in the moment that the tension\r\nremains. We only know what she knows, so she has to be our conduit to the film,\r\nresponding to each new hurdle and conflict as we would.  The final half-hour of \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d is pretty much\r\ngoing to dominate the conversation around the film. Without spoiling anything,\r\nit\u2019s a series of events in which Michelle finds new challenges around every\r\ncorner (that would only be a spoiler if you\u2019ve never seen a thriller). While I\u2019m\r\nnot sure it\u2019s as narratively sound as it could have been\u2014and one can see the\r\nretrofitting of the traditional thriller into the sci-fi universe\u2014Winstead and\r\nthe filmmakers keep it working through sheer confidence. Like the opening\r\nscenes of the film, the final act is largely dialogue-free. There\u2019s none of\r\nthat character-talking-to-herself nonsense you see in lesser films that aren\u2019t\r\nas sure of themselves when it comes to visual storytelling. So many movies hold\r\nyour hand as you go over every hill on the rollercoaster. When it gets to its finale \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d\r\nwants you to throw both hands in the air and scream.", "Critic": "Beta"}
