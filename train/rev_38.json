{"Title": "After the Storm", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Hirokazu Kore-eda has drawn comparisons to Yasujiro Ozu in the way he\u2019s not as interested in major plot twists or set pieces as he is subtle human emotion, typically hinging on family dynamics. In films like \u201cNobody Knows,\u201d \u201cAfter Life\u201d and \u201cStill Walking\u201d (the three best of an incredible career if you\u2019re looking for a place to start), he turns the camera into a window. We look through it and see people a lot like us on the other side, but that empathy never comes through manipulation or clich\u00e9. With his latest, the remarkably moving \u201cAfter the Storm,\u201d he again finds truth and drama in relatable human behavior, and does so by sketching fully-realized, three-dimensional characters. \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d is about a man unable to live in the present. He is always longing for what he\u2019s lost or dreaming about what he has yet to achieve. And it\u2019s destroying him. We\u2019ve all been there. We\u2019ve all waded in regret and felt skeptical about the future. \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d is one of our best filmmaker\u2019s best films. Advertisement Ryota (Hiroshi Abe) has understandable reasons for his depression. He\u2019s a prize-winning author, but he has yet to follow up on the success of his novel, The Empty Table. He has a job working as a private detective, but it doesn\u2019t seem to bring him much joy\u2014and it\u2019s a profession that plays into Kore-eda\u2019s themes as Ryota is always looking at other people\u2019s lives instead of his own. He\u2019s taken to bringing along his P.I. colleague on surveillance of his ex-wife Kyoko (Yoko Maki), who has a new beau. Even though Ryota has never met the new man in Kyoko\u2019s life, he feels challenged by him, especially when it comes to the attention of his son Shingo (Taiyo Yoshizawa). One night, during a typhoon, Ryota finds himself stuck in his mother\u2019s (the amazing Kirin Kiki) apartment with Shingo and Kyoko. There are no grand revelations or emotional breakdowns, just a series of heartfelt conversations, but the sunlight looks a bit different the next day. \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d is as delicately balanced as any film Kore-eda has made, a film that seems to not have much action or momentum but finds cumulative emotional power. Ryota worries about his mother now that his father has passed; he spies on his ex and son; he gambles more than he should\u2014he lives in the past, always talking about his now-broken family, his father, his childhood. And he has a certain victimhood to his tone when he does so, as if life dealt him a bad hand and it\u2019s not his fault. There\u2019s an almost throwaway moment\u2014although Kore-eda\u2019s films are so finely balanced they contain no such thing\u2014in which Ryota and his partner tell a client about a cheating husband, and she doesn\u2019t respond as emotionally as they expect, saying \u201cFor better or worse, it\u2019s all part of my life.\u201d It's that comfort with life's speedbumps and the fact that they shape us as much as anything. Ryota is the kind of guy who gives money to his mother and then asks to borrow some from his sister. He so desperately wants to impress those about whom he cares deeply, and he confuses material goods and cash flow with actual communication and attention. Notice how he doesn\u2019t eat when he takes his son out for a meal\u2014he can\u2019t afford it\u2014and he totally wastes the chance to get to know him by grilling the boy about the new man in his mother\u2019s life. Perfectly directed by Kore-eda, Hiroshi Abe gives one of the best performances in any of his films. He has the perfect hangdog face: unable to make eye contact easily, uncombed hair and unshaven. And yet we can also easily see the good man underneath the weight of life\u2019s problems. Advertisement Or perhaps that should be the \u201cimagined\u201d weight of life\u2019s problems. As corny as it sounds, \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d made me reconsider some of my own insecurities and anxieties. There are so many things in life that have value mostly because of how much we obsess about them, and Kore-eda\u2019s film reminds us that nothing is more important than the moment you are currently in, especially when that moment is spending time with your children. Over the last couple decades, he has been an essential filmmaker when it comes to one of Roger\u2019s most famous quotes\u2014his defining of film as an empathy machine. Few filmmakers know how to work that machine with more finesse and nuance.", "Critic": "Beta"}
