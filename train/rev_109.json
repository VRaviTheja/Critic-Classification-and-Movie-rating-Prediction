{"Title": "Burnt", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Food porn, no matter how expertly and attractively presented, is no substitute for actual food. But if you are susceptible to the blandishments of food porn, \u201cBurnt,\u201d a new Bradley-Cooper-starring drama about a brilliant-but-troubled chef looking for a shot at redemption, might leave you hungry for a meal you\u2019ll possibly be hard-pressed to afford.\u00a0Money-wise, and maybe existentially.\u00a0 \n Heavy on beautifully-lit tight shots of blue burner flames, immaculate china plates, various foams, glazes, char marks, roots, zests, and all other manner of mouth-watering visuals for discriminating gourmands (the consultant on kitchen matters was pioneering chef Mario Batali, a bonafide kitchen genius), \u201cBurnt\u201d concentrates on the fashionable high-end of gastronomy. Cooper\u2019s character, Adam Jones recounts in voice-over that he\u2019s been doing penance for unspecified sins by shucking oysters in New Orleans \u2026 and, once he\u2019s gotten to one million, boom, suddenly he\u2019s in London, making snide comments to hotel restaurant ma\u00eetre d' Daniel Br\u00fchl about the mediocre quality of his fare. Adam isn\u2019t just in-person trolling fancy joints in this big, you\u2019ll excuse the word, foodie town. No, Br\u00fchl\u2019s Tony shares a past with Adam. Although London\u2019s a big town, the fact that Adam can\u2019t turn a corner without running into someone from his past makes the place seem like one of the backstage areas depicted in the recent Steve Jobs movie. Why, here\u2019s Omar Sy\u2019s Michel, who Adam pranked most heinously in Paris back in the day. And here\u2019s Uma Thurman\u2019s Simone, a restaurant critic Adam once dallied with against her better judgment, not just because Adam\u2019s a bad egg, but because Simone herself is a lesbian (that\u2019s JUST how much of a bad egg Adam really is). Adam also meets, and alienates, a few newbies: Sam Keeley\u2019s eager young chef cadet David, upon whose couch Adam imposes, and single-mom sous-chef Helene, who is a single-mom sous-chef played by Sienna Miller, so take a wild guess.\u00a0 Advertisement \n \u201cBurnt\u201d is yet another redemption story of the Destructive Genius, whom the audience is supposed to be compelled to like in spite of himself, and who begins his journey with a list of things he\u2019s not supposed to indulge in (in this case\u2014surprise\u2014it\u2019s booze, drugs, and women). Then, the narrative bends circumstances to allow the Destructive Genius to get at least one of those things (take a guess\u2026could it be a\u2026single mom sous-chef?) and pull off a triumph, also in spite of himself, but with the assistance of a Crucial Teachable Moment.\u00a0 \n \"Ugh,\" one might say, and one might have a point. One doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s better or worse that the whole scenario is polished with the sheen that I once called the Weinstein Tradition of Quality, back around the time of \u201cThe Cider House Rules,\u201d I think. Miramax Films may no longer exist, but under their Weinstein Company rubric, Harvey and Bob Weinstein continue to make, albeit with somewhat less frequency than they used to, Miramax-y product. Miramax-y product did/does have its virtues, however, and since John Wells is a director of some conscience and screenwriter Steven Knight is in fact capable of first-rate work, \u201cBurnt\u201d packs some minor surprises and attractive details along its way\u2014one sequence in which David draws an analogy between Michelin book stars and \u201cStar Wars\u201d heroes is funny and apt\u2014and shows a certain amount of restraint when the inevitable triumphant note is struck.\u00a0There\u2019s also the cast. If you\u2019ve got any use for Cooper at all you\u2019ll be rather taken with him here. He gets to speak French, throw his own version of a Gordon Ramsey-style fit (many times, even), and does some serious twinkling when it\u2019s time to exercise the charm. The movie goes up several notches in quality every time Emma Thompson, as a sagacious therapist, turns up. Miller is tops, Sy is terrific, Br\u00fchl does quite well, particularly after his character is given a little revelation of his own, and Alicia Vikander makes a strong impression, as she does, in a very brief appearance. I have made a sacred vow to myself not to use the phrases \u201chungry for more\u201d or \u201cempty calories\u201d in what they call the \u201ckicker\u201d of my review, so forgive me if I end it on the abrupt side. Like so.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
