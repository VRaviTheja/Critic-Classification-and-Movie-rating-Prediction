{"Title": "Amanda Knox", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Netflix\u2019s \u201cAmanda Knox\u201d opens with a gut check statement\r\nabout this case that I hadn\u2019t really considered. There are many reasons that this\r\nnow-almost-decade-old case entranced the world, but chief among them may be\r\nwhat Knox says herself at the open of the film: \u201cEither I\u2019m a psychopath in\r\nsheep\u2019s clothing or I am YOU.\u201d Either this seemingly sweet, na\u00efve girl is\r\nactually a total sociopath\u2014someone who tortured and killed her roommate for fun\u2014or\r\nthis seemingly sweet, na\u00efve girl was accused of something she didn\u2019t do, which\r\nmeans this could happen to anyone. Either situation is terrifying. \u201cAmanda Knox\u201d\r\ndoes an admirable job of detailing the crucial facts of the case. I don\u2019t\r\nsuspect it will persuade anyone convinced that Knox is akin to the Monster of\r\nFlorence, and it undeniably takes a pro-Knox stance, but it\u2019s a well-made,\r\naccomplished piece of filmmaking that works because of how it focuses such a\r\nlarge case down to its key players, thereby illuminating how something like\r\nthis could happen to anyone. Advertisement In November of 2007, Amanda Knox was living in Perugia,\r\nItaly with her British roommate Meredith Kercher. She claimed that she came\r\nhome after spending the night with her boyfriend Rafael Sollecito to find a\r\nbloodbath. The window was broken and Kercher\u2019s throat had been cut. There was\r\nblood everywhere and there were even feces in the toilet. A year later, Rudy\r\nGuede was convicted of murdering Kercher\u2014the feces belonged to him and his DNA\r\nwas all over the scene. And yet the local cops never gave up their theory that Knox\r\nand maybe Sollecito were also involved. Why? Well, first there\u2019s the way Knox behaved the day the\r\nbody was found. She came home and showered before she found Kercher\u2019s body\u2014which\r\nthe police found odd. And she was caught by cameras kissing Sollecito while the\r\npolice were handling the scene. She didn\u2019t seem to be handling the discovery \u201cnormally,\u201d\r\nas if that\u2019s an easy thing to define for a 20-year-old girl in a foreign\r\ncountry. The next day, when she was brought back to the scene by prosecutor Giuliano\r\nMignini, who is introduced in the film comparing himself to Sherlock Holmes in\r\ncase you need to know about his ego, Knox had something of a breakdown,\r\nsmacking her ears and screaming. Mignini became convinced she was remembering\r\nkilling Kercher. The Italian cops interrogated and allegedly abused Knox until\r\nshe confessed.  Amanda Knox tells horrifying stories of her treatment by the\r\nItalian police, including being slapped in the head by them and told she had\r\nHIV. And if that abusive invasion of privacy wasn\u2019t enough, the media jumped\r\ninto the same pool, personified in the film by Daily Mail journalist Nick Pisa,\r\na morally dubious fellow who admits to being given Knox\u2019s prison diary and\r\npublishing passages from it and then speaks of \u201cjournalistic principles\u201d when\r\nasked how he got it. The media industry turned Knox\u2019s sexuality into a weapon\u2014she\r\nwas scolded for her supposed immorality and that was used as the basis for the prosecution's version of the crime. And the number of half-truths and lies printed by people like Pisa is\r\nstaggering. At one point, he says \u201cIt\u2019s not like I could double check\u201d because\r\nthat means someone else would run the story first. He still sees Knox as a \"story\" instead of a human being. Advertisement There was almost no trace of Knox\u2019s DNA in any\r\nessential part of this case\u2014and the DNA that did convict her at one point was\r\nlater deemed inconsequential or contaminated\u2014and Guede\u2019s DNA was all over the scene.\r\nSo you have to believe that she cleaned up the scene perfectly but not her\r\nco-killer\u2019s feces in the toilet or she committed the crime in a hazmat suit.\r\nAnd yet people like Mignini consistently dismiss these kind of factual questions\r\nwith comments about what they could tell by looking in Knox\u2019s eyes. He even\r\ncalls himself a prophet in his own country after the first conviction. This\r\nwasn\u2019t a story of justice or murder. It was a story of men who saw a way to use\r\na girl to further their own careers, as prosecutors and journalists. Again, if you think Amanda Knox is a masterful criminal,\r\nsomeone who got away with murder, this film is unlikely to convince you\r\notherwise. Most of this information has been available before\u2014although some of\r\nthe first-hand accounts of the interrogations from Knox and Sollecito are new.\r\nIt\u2019s just seeing it all presented in one, impactful film that one can view the\r\nscope of the whole story. Whether you think she did it or not, \u201cAmanda Knox\u201d is\r\na horror story that should be told.", "Critic": "Beta"}
