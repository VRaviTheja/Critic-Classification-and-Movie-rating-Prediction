{"Title": "Bad Hair", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Junior (Samuel Lange Zambrano), a nine-year-old boy living in a housing \r\nproject in Caracas, wants to straighten his wild curls. He pours \r\nmayonnaise and oil on his hair, and struggles to get a comb through. He experiments with his grandmother's blow \r\ndryer. Junior's mother Marta (Samantha Castillo), harassed and exhausted, sees\r\n her son's obsession with his hair as an ominous sign. When she looks at\r\n him, more often than not it is with an expression of disgust. His hair \r\nis from his black father, no longer in the picture.\u00a0 Marta has another \r\nbaby, seemingly from a different father, and the baby has long straight \r\nhair. Marta showers the baby with love and affection, all as Junior \r\nlooks on from the next room. Maybe if his hair was straight, his mother \r\nwould love him. Mariana Rond\u00f3n's \"Bad Hair\" is a stark and often brutal \r\nlook at one boy's pre-sexual awakening of identity and how that impacts \r\nhis life. What is it like to know who you are before you understand what\r\n that will mean? Populated with totally naturalistic performances, and a\r\n stunningly observed relationship between mother and son (their scenes \r\ntogether are phenomenal), \"Bad Hair\" works by keeping its focus on the \r\nsmall details of everyday life and its rhythms. It is not didactic about\r\n sexuality, and it does not sentimentalize childhood or its main child \r\ncharacter. Advertisement \r\nShot by Micaela Cajahuaringa with an intensely realistic style, \"Bad \r\nHair\" presents a world that is overcrowded, loud, and chaotic. People \r\ndon't have time to think in this cacophony. There is no room to breathe. \r\nPoverty and overcrowding grind people down. The highways are clogged \r\nwith cars, and the gigantic dilapidated tenement buildings loom high, \r\nsurrounded by the vast space of basketball courts and parking lots. \r\nEarly on, Junior and his best friend (Maria Emilia Sulbaran) stand on \r\nhis balcony, staring at the wall of windows across the way, the sheer \r\nsea of diverse humanity on display, packed on top of one another, and \r\nthey speculate on the lives everyone leads over there. They are children\r\n and they don't understand everything but they see all. \r\nEarly on, there's a scene where a group of rowdy boys in the housing \r\nproject blast music and break-dance.\u00a0 Junior stands on the sidelines \r\nwatching, enjoying himself, and then slowly starts to sway, closing his \r\neyes and raising his arms. It is in total contrast to the jagged hip-hop\r\n energy of the other boys, but in such a moment Junior is being himself.\r\n It is pure joy. Marta comes across this scene, takes one look at how \r\ndifferent Junior looks from everyone else, and drags him away, asking \r\nhim why he has to dance like that. He doesn't know. \r\nSchool is about to start, and all children need to have an ID photo \r\ntaken. Junior and his little friend fantasize about their photos; it is a\r\n major topic of conversation. Junior is determined to have straight hair\r\n for the photo. His friend sees nothing wrong with that. She loves her \r\nown hair, and puts little clips and barrettes in it, and the two of them\r\n loll about all day watching beauty pageants together on television. He \r\nlocks himself in the bathroom and experiments with different \r\nstraightening products, all as Marta bangs on the door furiously. Advertisement \r\nMarta's hothead grim personality may be why she lost her job. She is \r\nunder investigation for some type of misbehavior, and she is desperate \r\nto get the job back. She drops Junior and the baby off with a neighbor, \r\nor, more reluctantly, with Junior's paternal grandmother Carmen (Nelly \r\nRamos). Carmen encourages the parts of Junior that Marta despises. She \r\nplays him pop songs, and dances around, singing into a hairbrush. She \r\nstraightens his hair for him, too, warning him to put water on it before\r\n Marta arrives to pick him up. There are wary scenes of mutual suspicion\r\n between the two women. Carmen suggests that Junior come live with her \r\nfor good. \"He likes to look nice and dress up,\" Carmen says bluntly. \r\n\"You don't like that.\" \r\nJunior is at the mercy of the adults around him. Marta is unpredictable:\r\n she is rough and mean, indifferent and impatient, but on a dime she can\r\n suddenly turn tender and caring. Dealing with his mother is like \r\ntiptoeing through a landmine, and when she lashes out, Junior recoils, \r\nnot understanding what he has done. Marta's most horrible and \r\nunforgivable choice comes out of thinking it is what Junior needs. Her \r\nformer boss notices the contemptuous way she treats Junior and comments \r\non it. She balks: \"I need to be a role model for my kids.\" She does not \r\nunderstand what she is doing. Samantha Castillo is fearless in what is \r\nan extremely unpleasant and complex role. \r\nMarta and Junior are locked in a battle of the wills. The hair becomes \r\nthe symbol of the much larger issue that Marta senses (and Junior is too\r\n young to realize). It is a macho and rough world and Marta thinks her \r\nson is too effeminate. Junior's innocent crush on the teenage boy who \r\nruns the newsstand in the projects is seen as an incredibly sinister \r\ndevelopment. To Junior, he just wants straight hair and wants to look \r\nfabulous in his school photo. He is struggling to blossom. Little Samuel\r\n Lange Zambrano is a revelation. He stares at his mother for long \r\nperiods of time as she sews on the couch, and you can see his entire \r\nuniverse\u2014betrayal and sadness and longing for her\u2014on his face. He is an \r\namazing young actor. Advertisement \r\nTold in a slow and deliberate manner, with documentary-style realism, \r\n\"Bad Hair\" is not conventional storytelling, but it is all the more \r\neffective because of that. The scenes between Marta and Junior, often \r\nplaying out in one take, are rich with behavior, and sharp glances, \r\nsudden changes in mood (sometimes violent) and spontaneous reactions in \r\nthe moment. Their dynamic feels dangerous, a live wire coiling about the\r\n room. Mariana Rond\u00f3n has created a powerful and very human story about a\r\n young child's growing sense of self, and his innocent and baffled \r\nreactions to adult resistance and cruelty. \"Bad Hair\" is extremely \r\nprovocative in its quiet way, and pulls none of its punches. What will \r\nhappen to Junior, I found myself worrying. Can't everyone just let him be? Rond\u00f3n, a major talent, is not afraid to \r\nfollow her story to its logically bleak conclusion, but the end-credits \r\nsequence suggests hope.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
