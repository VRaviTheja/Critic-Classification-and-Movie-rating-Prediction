{"Title": "Wedding Doll", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The Israeli film \u201cWedding Doll,\u201d written and directed by\r\nNitzan Gilady, has an unusual amount of pictorial beauty, both of the harsh and\r\nsoft varieties. The harshness, or at least starkness, is provided by the Negev\r\nDesert, around which the movie is set. Its golden planes and imposing\r\npromontories are spectacular and a bit intimidating. The soft beauty is provided\r\nby the film\u2019s lead actress, the brightly open-faced Moran Rosenblatt, who plays\r\nHagit, a mentally disabled young woman who has an uncanny talent: she crafts\r\nlovely little dolls using toilet paper and the rolls it comes on as her main\r\nmaterial.  Advertisement Hagit has a job at the small factory that manufactures said\r\nhousehold staple, and the place isn\u2019t doing so well. The owner wants to shut it\r\ndown, but his ambitious son Omri (Roy Assaf) wants to innovate; either way,\r\nshe\u2019ll be out of a job. To forestall this, Hagit has her mom Sara (Assi Levy)\r\ndrive her to a gown shop, where she hopes to work as a seamstress. Her halting\r\nspeech and awkward manner mean she\u2019s going to get the high hat, and she gets a\r\nvariation on that quite a bit, even from a school kid who bounces a soccer ball\r\nat her and calls her \u201cweirdo.\u201d  It\u2019s worse than that: Hagit and her mom are estranged from\r\nother members of the family, including Hagit\u2019s brother, whose infant child was\r\nonce almost accidentally dropped by his sister. Omri is carrying on with Hagit\r\na bit behind everybody\u2019s back, insisting that he keep their relationship secret\r\n(Omri is also less than truthful to his buddies, who make a fine trio of\r\nnarrow-minded small town vitelloni to\r\nbe sure). Hagit is convinced that she\u2019s on the fast track to marriage with Omri\r\nwhether the factory closes or not.  Oy. As much intriguing local detail and sharp\r\ncharacterization writer/director Gilady brings to bear on this concise tale,\r\nthe tale itself depicts the beautiful and often uncomprehending Hagit getting\r\nlet down over and over again. It\u2019s heartbreaking. I understand that the viewer\r\nis meant to be won over, and possibly inspired, by the character\u2019s resilience.\r\nAnd while the movie\u2019s disinclination to give Hagit any kind of break,\r\nfairy-tale or otherwise, speaks well of its commitment to a kind of realism,\r\nthe depiction of provincial bigotry against differently-abled folk is, while\r\nlikely accurate, also just plain depressing. The integrity of the filmmaking\r\nand the luminosity of Rosenblatt\u2019s performance are undeniable. And I suppose\r\nthe fact that I was affected as I was by \u201cWedding Doll\u201d is testimony to its\r\nemotional effectiveness. But while Hagit is able to crack a smile at the\r\nmovie\u2019s end, I feel a pall wrapping around me every time I contemplate her predicament,\r\nor the predicament of her real-life models.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
