{"Title": "Life on the Line", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "At the end of this movie, before the closing credits, a few screens\u2019 worth of text informs the viewer of the casualty rate of the electrical lineman over the past few years, and gives the name of a website whose mission \u201cis to memorialize fallen electrical line workers, and care for the families who have lost or are impacted by a severe injury of a loved one in the line of duty. We strive to consolidate accident and injury information to share openly for a safer work environment.\u201d Its web address is http://fallenlinemen.org and the site is well worth visiting. Advertisement I point this out now because I am obliged to assess the movie that preceded it. That movie does not, I think, do the job it intended, which was, I think, to make the lineman's work accessible to the viewer and to honor the courage and sacrifice of those who labor to keep the nation\u2019s electrical grid safe and operative. This is one of those \u201cbased on true events\u201d movies that give you the distinct feeling that the true events deserved better.  After introducing the framing device of an interview with a lineman played by Devon Sawa, the movie begins again with a prologue set in 1998 Texas, with John Travolta, in unconvincing young-age makeup, as Beau Ginner, a Texas lineman working in the middle of a lightning storm. He fails to rig some wires properly; his coworker, who\u2019s also his brother, chastises him, goes up the pole, and is soon killed after lightning hits a wire. His sister-in-law is killed in an auto accident rushing to the scene. Ginner is left with his memories, his job, and his young niece Bailey, who grows up to be played by Kate Bosworth, who also played the sister-in-law.  Experience has made Beau a safety maven, and sentiment has made Bailey a \u2018round the way girl who has the potential to go to college (one would think so, at age 33, although I guess Bosworth\u2019s playing younger) but prefers to work in a diner and be a townie\u2014which means being part of the lineman extended family. Here is where the narrative complications come in, and boy is director David Hackl not up for them. Here we go: Bailey has a sort-of ex-boyfriend named Duncan (that\u2019s Devon Sawa\u2019s character) who\u2019s a bit of a bad boy, motorcycle and all. (He\u2019s also got an alcoholic mom, a lineman widow, played by Sharon Stone in dampened \u201cCasino\u201d mode.) He\u2019s decided to straighten out, so he gets a job working the line, much to the chagrin of Beau. Then there\u2019s Ron (Matt Bellefleur), a creepy ex of Bailey\u2019s who\u2019s hanging around all sorts of places where he isn\u2019t welcome. Beau and Bailey also have new across-the-street neighbors, Ryan Robbins\u2019 Eugene, a lineman who\u2019s also an Iraq war veteran with PTSD, and his wife Carline (Julie Benz), who\u2019s good-hearted and loyal up to a point, and who picks the wrong way to balk at Eugene\u2019s neglect and borderline abuse. As a major storm approaches their town\u2014you know this because every other scene or so a title comes up saying \u201c[X] Days Before THE STORM,\u201d with graphics like some cable news special or something\u2014the characters abrade each other in various ways, Bailey reveals a secret, and something\u2019s gotta give. In case you missed it, it\u2019s pretty clear that the storm is gonna make everything and more do that giving. These plot lines aren\u2019t simple, but they\u2019re not exactly convoluted either. Frequently while watching \u201cLife on the Line\u201d I thought how much better they\u2019d be handled\u2014straight and clean and without fuss\u2014in a 1930s or 40s working-man\u2019s melodrama from Warner Brothers, maybe one by a director along the lines of Raoul Walsh. He made one of the great men-in-a-dangerous-profession pictures, 1940\u2019s \u201cThey Drive By Night,\u201d about truck drivers. But \u201cLife on the Line\u201d muddles them hopelessly, first by way of its myriad and busy structural devices, and then by inserting flashbacks that have all the logic of hiccups, and then, finally, by overplaying its melodramatic hand.  Advertisement To John Travolta\u2019s credit, he doesn\u2019t phone in what could have been an indifferent role. His accent gets a little broad at times, but he\u2019s sincere and conscientious in his portrayal of a working man who doesn\u2019t want to be a hero, but will if he has to be. Sawa is better than okay too, as is Gil Bellows; only Bellefleur strays into egregious ham territory. The themes and the actors make you want the movie to be better, but the overreach combined with the sloppy sensationalism of the suspense scenes make \u201cLife on the Line\u201d the wrong kind of cinematic ordeal.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
