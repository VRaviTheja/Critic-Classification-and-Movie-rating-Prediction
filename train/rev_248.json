{"Title": "Legend", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "The Kray Brothers, Reggie and Ronnie, were such\r\nostentatiously violent and vulgar gangsters that they practically constituted a\r\nself-parody. They were both newly in jail when the then-also-new comedy troupe\r\nMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus deemed to lampoon them with a sketch about \u201cThe\r\nPiranha Brothers,\u201d Doug and Dinsdale, but the thing about that sketch, as it happened,\r\nwas just how little it needed to\r\nstray from reality in order to hit the comic mark. Nevertheless, the Krays, who\r\nruled criminal London from the late 1950s until their imprisonment in 1968, did\r\nreal and wide-ranging human harm in their careers; this is a fact that Brian\r\nHelgeland, writer and director of a new crime movie about the twins, doesn\u2019t\r\nseem to have any good ideas about what to do with. But that isn\u2019t why \u201cLegend\u201d\r\nis such a muddle right off the bat.  Advertisement Right off the bat it\u2019s a muddle because of Helgeland\u2019s\r\nslavish devotion to Martin Scorsese, a bad thing to display when you don\u2019t have\r\nScorsese\u2019s chops. Early on in the picture, as Reggie Kray, the relatively\r\ncharming, less psychotically violent of the fellows, is courting his future\r\nwife Frances, Helgeland opts to do a little \u201cGoodFellas.\u201d As Reggie escorts\r\nFrances into a pub where he\u2019s the kingpin, the moving camera follows from\r\nbehind and glides alongside the couple as various friends of Reggie pay their\r\nrespects. On a stage at the back, a singer is crooning \u201cThe Look of Love,\u201d a\r\nsong that had not actually been written when the scene takes place, but never\r\nmind that. You know where this is going. Helgeland wants to create his own\r\nversion of the famed Copacabana tracking shot in Scorsese\u2019s legendary 1990\r\ngangster film, but he hasn\u2019t quite worked out all the choreography\u2014hence, the\r\naforementioned singer ends up performing the world\u2019s longest version of \u201cThe\r\nLook of Love,\u201d at least until the point at which the sound editor or someone\r\ndecided to have mercy and faded the guy out and substituted some\r\ngeneric-sounding movie music. This is merely one example, and a pretty\r\noutstanding one. There are plenty more throughout the film. (All of this is\r\ndoubly stupefying when one recalls what a solid job Helgeland did in both\r\nwriting and directing departments in his last picture, the 2013 Jackie Robinson\r\nstory \u201c42.\u201d) The movie\u2019s main advantage and/or talking point is Tom\r\nHardy, who plays both twins. Reggie is slick and confident, while Ronnie, a\r\nparanoid schizophrenic with strong sadistic tendencies, is like Lenny in \u201cOf\r\nMice And Men\u201d if Lenny had been an East London mook, and evil to boot. Both\r\nperformances are commanding, but not as commanding as they might have been. The\r\nweaknesses of Helgeland\u2019s writing and directing are also to blame here.\r\nParticularly the latter: the unimaginative (and, I imagine, practically\r\nexpedient) framing of the two Hardys during scenes in which they\u2019re together\r\nmakes the dual performance play like a tricksy stunt at times. Helgeland could\r\nhave learned a great deal from the blocking of dual Jeremy Irons accomplished\r\nby David Cronenberg in \u201cDead Ringers,\u201d which made the viewer feel as if there\r\nwere really two different people in the frame. Too many times here there\u2019s the\r\nfeel of two different performances. Sometimes Hardy manages to ignite a spark.\r\nThere\u2019s a scene in which Chazz Palmentieri, playing a bluff emissary from the\r\nAmerican Mafia, makes the twins an offer they\u2019re better off not refusing,\r\nRonnie\u2019s belligerence notwithstanding. When Ronnie makes an unabashed\r\nannouncement concerning his sexual preferences to this wise guy, it\u2019s a real\r\nmoment. As is one with Hardy\u2019s Reggie, finally confessing at the end to his\r\nbrother why he\u2019s directing his own violent impulses so destructively into one\r\ntarget.  Moments such as these are too few and far between, while\r\nmoments such as a wedding scene prefaced by the song \u201cChapel of Love\u201d are far\r\ntoo many. The lucky bride is Reggie\u2019s, and her name is Frances, and it\u2019s with\r\nFrances\u2019 story that the movie, for me, broke away from irritating mediocrity\r\nand into genuine badness.  Helgeland\u2019s conception of Frances is doubly banal. First, he\r\nsaddles her with the burden of semi-omniscient narration that\u2019s rife with\r\nplatitudinous nonsense (\u201cIt was time for the Krays to enter the secret history\r\nof the 1960s\u201d and \u201cNot even Scotland Yard could ignore murder on the street,\u201d\r\nthe latter of which has the uncomfortable echo of the bit in the Piranha\r\nBrothers sketch wherein the gangsters detonate a nuclear device over London).\r\nSecond, he gives her onscreen character hardly any more depth than any of the\r\ncomplaining gangster and/or undercover cop wives you\u2019ve seen in dozens of crime\r\npictures over the years, Emily Browning\u2019s committed performance\r\nnotwithstanding. Which makes Helgeland\u2019s final trick with this character all\r\nthe more objectionable when he finally pulls it. I knew a bit about the case of\r\nthe Krays before coming in to the screening of the picture, but that knowledge\r\nwasn\u2019t at the forefront of my consciousness as I watched the movie. And then I\r\nthought \u2026 wait a minute. And sure enough \u2026  Advertisement Spoiler alert: Reginald Kray\u2019s real-life first wife, Frances\r\nShea, committed suicide in 1967, two years after marrying Kray. And this is\r\nindeed depicted in the last fifth of the film, complete with\r\nFrances-as-narrator playing a little bit of \u201cgotcha\u201d with the audience. It\r\nstrikes me as both aesthetically cheap and morally dubious to make an actual\r\nsuicide into your own Joe Gillis for the sake of \u2026 well, that\u2019s the other thing,\r\nwhich is I don\u2019t know what \u201cLegend\u201d was made in the sake of. It\u2019s a squalid\r\nstory told with very little in the way of a dynamic personal perspective, and\r\nhence a waste of its very talented cast.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
