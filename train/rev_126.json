{"Title": "Welcome to Leith", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "How far do you stretch the definition of acceptance of other\u2019s\r\nbeliefs and free speech? We all like to think that we would allow all\r\ndifferences of opinion, personality, and character to stand, proudly quoting\r\nthe First Amendment as we watch Neo-Nazis march down Main Street. Really think\r\nabout it though. What if your neighbor patrolled the perimeter of his property\r\nwith a loaded shotgun? What if he came to city council meetings and verbally\r\nharassed people to such a degree that nothing was out of bounds, including\r\nmocking the murder of a council member\u2019s daughter? What if he preached hate and\r\nintolerance, and threatened to turn your neighborhood into one of the\r\nfrontlines for the battle for White Power? Would you really live and let live?  Advertisement These were the questions faced by the two dozen (literally,\r\nPopulation 24) residents of Leith, North Dakota, and deftly chronicled in\r\nMichael Beach Nichols and Christopher K. Walker\u2019s unsettling and downright\r\ndepressing \u201cWelcome to Leith.\u201d When Craig Cobb became the 25th\u00a0resident of Leith, it became a national story. At first, no one really noticed\r\nthe grizzled old man who started buying up empty lots in an area of the country\r\ndescribed as \u201cB-roll for The Walking Dead.\u201d\r\nThen Cobb made his presence known, announcing to the other members of the White\r\nPower Movement\u2014for which he had been an outspoken leader\u2014that he was basically\r\ntaking over Leith. He invited people who believed as he did to move to\r\nLeith, hoping to turn the city into a compound for his\r\norganization, dominating votes on the city council and building monuments to his movement. When Cobb\u2019s allies started buying the lots from him, and one\r\nnotable skinhead and his wife even moved in, the locals started to panic. Nichols and Walker are careful to allow Cobb\u2019s words and\r\nactions to demonize him more than their filmmaking. It would have been easy to\r\nsensationalize this story\u2014using true crime documentary camera techniques to\r\nreally turn up the heat on Cobb\u2019s rhetoric. Instead, they merely spent as much\r\ntime with the aggravator as possible, watching him torment people at city\r\ncouncil meetings and swear at his neighbors. They carefully avoid making \u201cWelcome\r\nto Leith\u201d about what Cobb believes in, focusing on how those beliefs impact a\r\ncommunity more than the hatred and vitriol within them. To that end, they\r\nsurprisingly avoid much conversation with the only minority in Leith, who\r\nhappens to be the man who sold Cobb the property in the first place. Other\r\nfilmmakers would have made that the\r\nstory of \u201cWelcome to Leith.\u201d It\u2019s easy to make a documentary about hateful\r\npeople. It\u2019s harder to focus on the impact of hateful people on those around them. To that end, the creators of \u201cLeith\u201d spend an\r\nequal amount of time with Cobb and his cohorts as they do the residents of\r\nLeith, resulting in a notable balance in this portrait of a community. Again,\r\nbeing a strong proponent of free speech, I would never deny Cobb his right to\r\nbelieve what he does, and I find outspoken people like him less terrifying most\r\nof the time than those who hide their disgusting beliefs. At least we know\r\nwhere Cobb is and what he thinks. But Nichols and Walker raise fascinating\r\nquestions about just how much disagreement and hatred we\u2019re willing to accept\r\nfrom our neighbors, and they do so without much flair or over-direction. They\r\nprovide what we hope to get from films about small communities\u2014sketch it in\r\nsuch a way that the local story becomes one in which we can see universal\r\nissues. What happened in Leith could happen in hundreds of small towns across\r\nthe country, and, in many ways, is happening in major ones too, as hateful\r\npeople move in next to those they hate. As the world gets more crowded and\r\nintolerance shows no signs of dissipating, what we will do when we see a bit of\r\nthe drama in Leith in our own cities? Or maybe it's too late to even ask that question. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
