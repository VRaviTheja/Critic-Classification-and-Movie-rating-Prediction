{"Title": "Mifune: The Last Samurai", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The word \u201clegend\u201d is one that is arguably thrown around too often in any context, but it\u2019s no stretch at all to call Japanese movie star Toshiro Mifune \u201clegendary.\u201d Or \u201ciconic\u201d for that matter. The star of some of the greatest films ever made\u2014never mind nation or genre, just GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE\u2014the man was an exacting, electrifying performer. In documenting and celebrating his life and his films, you\u2019d have to go very far wrong indeed to come out of the effort with something bad or uninteresting. Advertisement   That said, \u201cMifune: The Last Samurai,\u201d a documentary on the actor directed by Steven Okazaki and narrated by Keanu Reeves (the script is by Okazaki and Stuart Galbraith IV) got off on a somewhat bad foot for me. Explaining Mifune\u2019s place in the firmament of pop culture, the narration says of his collaborations with director Akira Kurosawa, \u201cwithout them there would have been no \u2018Magnificent Seven.\u2019\u201d This is factually true but seems to me to throw out a very crucial baby with the bathwater. What makes Kurosawa and Mifune crucial is that without them there would be no \u201cSeven Samurai.\u201d   But the fact of the matter is that I\u2019m not the \u201ckey demo\u201d for this movie. \u201cMifune: The Last Samurai\u201d wasn\u2019t made for fans like me. Although fans like me will likely be the first in line to see it. After explaining Mifune\u2019s importance, the movie lays out a brief history of Japanese cinema, the \u201cchanbara\u201d (swordplay) movie in particular. Only then does it get to Mifune\u2019s fascinating life: Born in 1920 to parents who set up business in China, he only sets foot in Japan at age 20, to fight in World War II. That experience was traumatic, but not in a conventional way. Harboring no ambitions to act, he tries to follow a bit in his photographer father\u2019s footsteps by apprenticing as a camera assistant at a film studio. His good looks, simultaneously rugged and smooth get him noticed, and so\u2026   What the movie is very good at revealing and expanding upon is how this reluctant actor became such a masterful one. In part it was due to his presence. \u201cHe\u2019s not an actor who blends into the background,\u201d one of his surviving colleagues notes. In part it was due to what his life experience taught him. His experience made him determined, one interviewee notes, to \u201cnever again be the kind of person who bends to authority.\u201d But it was also, eventually, his devotion and his research. His frequent costar and friend Yoshio Tsuchiya notes \u201cThe one word I would use to describe Mifune is \u2018perseverance\u2019!\u201d Advertisement   Mifune put himself through a lot. He was a heavy drinker whose alcohol abuse ended up affecting his family life. His oldest son nevertheless remembers his father\u2019s great \u201ccompassion.\u201d The movie concentrates mostly on Mifune\u2019s collaboration with Kurosawa, which yielded great pictures such as the groundbreaking \u201cRashomon,\u201d \u201cSamurai,\u201d \u201cThe Hidden Fortress,\u201d \u201cYojimbo,\u201d and \u201cRed Beard.\u201d While it does not dig deep on what ended their collaboration (Martin Scorsese, also known as a director with a compelling long-term relationship with a single actor, now dormant, offers some fascinating rumination on the subject), its account of a sort of long-distance reconciliation is very moving.   The movie\u2019s clips are thrilling, and apt. While I commend \u201cMifune: The Last Samurai\u201d for its briskness, and its occasional crowd-pleasing playfulness\u2014as when it introduces viewers to the actor who put on the rubber suit to play Godzilla the same year he was a samurai in Kurosawa\u2019s classic\u2014it\u2019s a movie I myself could have stood to see more of. Fascinating Mifune/Kurosawa collaborations such as \u201cStray Dog\u201d and \u201cThe Idiot\u201d are given short shrift if mentioned at all. When going into Mifune\u2019s international career, his role in \u201cHell In The Pacific,\u201d in which he goes one-on-one with another icon/legend, Lee Marvin, is given the briefest of mentions. Last I looked, that movie\u2019s director John Boorman is both alive and as voluble as ever. And so on. Again, these quibbles arise from the fact that this is a beginner\u2019s guide, not a fest for fans. Is it too much to expect an expanded DVD edition though?", "Critic": "Gamma"}
