{"Title": "xXx: Return of Xander Cage", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "How excited ought one get about a sequel in an action franchise that never got off the ground, featuring the return of the leading man whose refusal to appear in the second installment was part of why the franchise never got off the ground, that finally sees theatrical release almost a decade after the intention to produce it was announced? I suppose it depends. Speaking strictly for myself, Vin Diesel, here coming back to play Xander Cage, the James Bond of skateboarding character he originated in 2002\u2019s \u201cXXX\u201d is the least exciting component of this 3D slam-bang fest.  Advertisement The movie opens with Samuel L. Jackson as the outr\u00e9 spymaster Augustus Gibbons, sitting at a Chinese restaurant trying to convince real-life soccer sensation Neymar to join the XXX team. A disaster ensues, and stern buttoned-up spymaster Marke (Toni Collette, here probably earning more to merely maintain an erect posture than she usually does when she\u2019s actually being an incredible actor) calls a meeting at an appropriately eerily-lit CIA boardroom. Here is introduced the McGuffin, here referred to as a Pandora\u2019s Box, which is immediately snatched up by a crack team of black-clad perhaps villains who can leap tall buildings in a single bound, that kind of stuff. One of their number is played by Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen, who made a strong impression in another blockbuster, \u201cRogue One,\u201d a little while back. Who can retrieve the deadly thingie? Marke has to track down the presumed-dead Xander Cage, who\u2019s now spending his faked-own-death hours providing satellite television to impoverished Latin American children. (Don\u2019t ask.) The plot, with its multiple double-crosses and \u201cthis group must somehow form a you-know-what\u201d plot beats, could have been written on the back of a cocktail napkin. More thought, but not that much more, was put into the cast of characters, the \u201crebels\u201d that embody the triple-X ethos (which is a thing\u2014remember that, absent Vin Diesel, there was a 2005 sequel, starring Ice Cube, subtitled \u201cState of the Union,\u201d in 2005). These include a more than fair number of women, which is commendable in theory. Less commendable in practice is that maybe a quarter of them are obligated to behave as if they\u2019re dying to fall into bed with Diesel. When Cage goes to London to track down the identities of the interlopers of the eerily-lit boardroom, he spends time sauna-side with an intelligence expert, name of Ainsley, who\u2019s played by Hermoine Caulfield, an actress in her mid twenties who looks about fifteen, and whose bikinied torso is practically drooled upon director of photography Russell Carpenter\u2019s camera. Things get a little less distasteful with the introductions of punky sniper Adele (Ruby Rose) on Xander\u2019s team and fast draw Serena (Deepika Padukone) on the opposite (but not for long). These two are almost enough to make up for Nina Dobrev\u2019s Becky, a geek girl who provides Xander with her \u201csafe word\u201d within minutes if not seconds of their meeting.  Anyway, Xander doesn\u2019t sleep with Ainsley; rather, she provides him access to about six of her girlfriends (in porn this is called a \u201creverse gangbang,\u201d and while what\u2019s depicted is hardly explicit, this is what the audience is meant to believe went on), after which Cage makes an observation on the lengths he goes to for his country that wasn\u2019t particularly funny when it first was heard, in, yes, a James Bond movie.  Vin Diesel is going to be fifty this year. His body is still toned, but facially he\u2019s starting to look like a cross between Harpo Marx and that poor fellow who played the Amazing Colossal Man. In medium close-ups, his head takes up two thirds of the screen. And his line readings haven\u2019t gained added suavity over the years. Forcing his character to be what they used to call catnip to the ladies here is just a lot of leading-man aggrandizement that serves no end for the actual viewer.  Advertisement D.J. Caruso\u2019s direction, for the most part, is second-tier Bayhem, with the camera swerving from a low angle as, say, a truck takes flight and pirouettes above it. However. The last forty minutes of the movie do come together in a pretty diverting way. Xander\u2019s motley crew musters a \u201cOhana means family\u201d vibe familiar to fans of the other franchise Diesel abandoned and then returned to, that \u201cFast and Furious\u201d thing. There\u2019s a bit of \u201cA-Team\u201d zaniness thrown in as well, and this makes the intercut parallel action sequences of the climax\u2014with Xander\u2019s crew on the ground while Diesel and Yen fight out the real bad guys on an intimidating government plane\u2014work pretty well. And Yen, despite being cut away from too quickly, too often, really delivers the martial arts goods. (Diesel\u2019s stunt double is frequently detectable.) There\u2019s also a fun cameo I won\u2019t spoil here, although I\u2019ve seen a trailer that spoils it, but that\u2019s life\u2014it\u2019s still kind of fun. And of course the whole thing ends with a setup for a sequel, which I hope gets to screens before Vin Diesel is about to hit sixty, although seeing him on a skateboard at that age might be pretty diverting.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
