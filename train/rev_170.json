{"Title": "Counting", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In his masterful \u201cMuseum Hours,\u201d filmmaker Jem Cohen merged his skills as an urban documentarian with a narrative about two unlikely\r\nfriends. Art, history, companionship, support and everyday life merged into one\r\nvision. His latest, \u201cCounting,\u201d billed as a \u201cA film in 15 Chapters,\u201d is both\r\nmore ambitious and less purposeful in its intent. Clearly designed as a nod to\r\nChris Marker (particularly \u201cSans Soleil\u201d), \u201cCounting\u201d captures life around the\r\nworld in all its simplicity and diversity, as Cohen bounces back and forth from\r\nNew York City to Russia to Turkey, and locales in between. There\u2019s little\r\nnarration, little noise at all outside of the hum of traffic or the whine of a\r\ntrain or the rustle of leaves. Most people in frame are seen from behind, or\r\nvia reflection, or from a distance. And there are cats. Everywhere. Cohen isn\u2019t\r\nas interested in faces as he is urban tableaus. The result is a challenging\r\nwork that can be both exhilarating and grueling in its deliberate pace. Cohen\r\nis an undeniably gifted filmmaker, even if the sum total of this piece isn\u2019t\r\nquite as interesting as its parts. Advertisement \u201cCounting\u201d opens in New York City, featuring footage that\r\nthe filmmaker captured around the city from 2012 to 2014. The first segment of \u201cCounting,\u201d\r\nwhich I believe is also its longest, is arguably its best as it\u2019s a fantastic\r\ndisplay of Cohen\u2019s skills. He can turn the mundane imagery of urban existence\r\ninto art by the way it\u2019s shot, scored, or juxtaposed with another image. What\r\ncaptures his eye and the way he weaves into a piece can often result in great\r\nart. In the first segment, we hear a speech about discovering the secrets of\r\nthe universe while we view a sedentary homeless person. We see a torn page with\r\na headline about \u201cThe World\u2019s Last Mysteries.\u201d Cohen is placing imagery and\r\naudio of the questions of the universe against reflections of travelers on a\r\ntrain or a homeless man crossing the street. This is daily life and the world\u2019s\r\ngreatest mysteries are contained within it. Cohen has a remarkable ability to go from placid, almost\r\nsoothing imagery to kinetic, more frantic footage like when he captures an \u201cI\r\nCan\u2019t Breathe\u201d protest scored to discordant, loud music. Even flags waving in\r\nthe wind at a car dealership look antagonistic. He\u2019s playing with the essence\r\nof filmmaking here, knowing that the images just before and after those flags,\r\nalong with the choice of audio, change the way the viewer responds to them.  Sometimes Cohen can be straightforward and even didactic,\r\nsuch as in chapter 7, in which he presents imagery of reflections of people on\r\ntheir phones accompanied by audio of testimony about the NSA wiretapping.\r\nAlthough even this \u201cshort film within the big film\u201d feels contextually resonant\r\nwithin a piece that feels, at least to me, about interconnectivity and\r\ncommonality. Cohen jumps around the world and finds numerous images that look\r\nlike reflections of each other. People crossing squares in New York City and\r\nSt. Petersburg become often indistinguishable. Some of his compositions are\r\npicture-postcard beautiful while others take a minute to even discern what it\r\nis being displayed. And he\u2019s obsessed with travel and motion. A voice sings in\r\none chapter, \u201cDo you ever wonder where it\r\nis you\u2019re wandering?\u201d We\u2019re all wanderers around this world that\u2019s more\r\nsimilar than we even know. There are times, many times actually, when \u201cCounting\u201d feels\r\na bit too self-indulgent, something that never struck me during \u201cMuseum Hours,\u201d\r\nan undeniably more accessible piece for the average filmgoer. It starts to get\r\na bit exhausting and unfocused. Unpacking \u201cCounting\u201d can be difficult, and it\r\nfeels at times like it\u2019s purposefully so, as if Cohen is challenging\r\ntraditional expectations of film analysis, even ones as often abstract as his.\r\nBut one cannot deny the ambition of \u201cCounting,\u201d a movie that travels the world,\r\nconnecting it through the commonality of both everyday behavior and the\r\nuniversal language of cinema. \u201cCounting\u201d ends almost peacefully, with images of calm and\r\nnight. I was hoping for a bit more cumulative power, something to tie these\r\nchapters together, but I think Cohen purposefully avoids those kind of easy\r\ncinematic answers. Maybe these are just images, people and places around the\r\nworld that he found interesting. Perhaps you will too. And sometimes life is as\r\nsimple as that. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
