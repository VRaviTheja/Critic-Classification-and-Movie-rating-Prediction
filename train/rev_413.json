{"Title": "Sand Castle", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Fernando Coimbra\u2019s \u201cSand Castle\u201d offers too little to the War is Hell genre to be noteworthy. It\u2019s a true story, and so that has some inherent value, and the young cast is relatively strong, especially a few stand-outs, but we\u2019ve seen too many similar stories in the decade-and-a-half since 9/11 for this one to register as anything special. On a production level, it\u2019s surprisingly flat, as if its story was strong enough to overcome a lack of visual language. Sadly, it\u2019s just not. The most interesting thing about \u201cSand Castle\u201d is when it takes place. Its protagonist, Private Matt Ocre (Nicholas Hoult) enlisted in the reserves to help pay for college \u2026 in July 2001. Of course, two months later, the world changed. The film opens with an Ocre so desperate to get out of combat that he slams his hand in a car door. It doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s quickly dispatched to Baghdad, where we meet this film\u2019s cast of military characters, led by the tough but rational Sgt. Harper (Logan Marshall-Green).  Advertisement Three months after an intense firefight that ends with an Apache helicopter producing American-brand devastation, Ocre and his team are sent to a small town called Baqubah. They\u2019re there to fix a water pumping station so the local villagers don\u2019t die of thirst. Of course, the station needs fixing because the U.S. forces bombed it. And, of course, some of the locals don\u2019t want the American soldiers anywhere near them. And so an interesting dynamic develops, one in which \u201cSand Castle\u201d becomes something of an allegory for U.S. foreign policy\u2014cleaning up a mess we made\u2014and one that reflects how those Oorah days after 9/11 (in which it felt, at least to some, that the United States was going to help save the Middle East) soon fell into quicksand. Ocre is increasingly aware of the futility of their very presence in Baqubah. When someone says in the final act, after a brutal loss of life, \u201cWell, a rough night, but it\u2019s not for nothing,\u201d it\u2019s tempting to disagree about the last part. The young cast of \u201cSand Castle\u201d delivers a mixed bag of performances. Hoult is one of those actors who needs a strong director to bring out his best work and Coimbra doesn\u2019t seem able to do that. He\u2019s too flat and uninteresting as a protagonist. His most interesting scene is his first, when he slams his hand in the Humvee door. After that, we don\u2019t really get to know him the way we need to. Far more interesting is Marshall-Green as the more resilient and experienced soldier. He\u2019s a very intriguing young actor who I hope to see more of soon. As for Henry Cavill, first surprising in a buzz cut and beard, he barely makes an impact, which has kind of become his norm. Better in the supporting cast are a slightly unhinged Glen Powell (\"Everybody Wants Some!!\") and a practical Parker Sawyers (\u201cSouthside with You\u201d). Ultimately, the biggest problems with \u201cSand Castle\u201d are familiarity and form (or lack thereof). As for the first, we\u2019ve seen this story before, at least a dozen times. Sure, the particulars are different, but the futility of war, especially in the 21st century, has been well documented. And there\u2019s just not enough new to this variation to justify the lack of character development and visual flair. It\u2019s too routine in nearly every way. Sure, there\u2019s a performance here or there, and a conversation-worthy topic about how wartime was different in 2003 than today, but neither of those are nearly enough to carry a film that\u2019s the last thing a war movie can possibly be: boring.
