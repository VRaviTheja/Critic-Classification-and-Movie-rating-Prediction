{"Title": "V/H/S: Viral", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "\u201cV/H/S: Viral,\u201d the third film after Sundance hits \u201cV/H/S\u201d\r\nand \u201cV/H/S/2,\u201d better represent the bottom of the barrel for this franchise\r\nbecause I don\u2019t think I can take much more. The first film had its issues, for\r\nsure, but at least it conveyed a DIY, nostalgic throwback to \u201880s horror that\r\ncould excuse some of its deeper flaws. And the second film had two segments\r\nthat I would call must-see, at least for horror fans. It was more polished than\r\nthe first movie (which many purists saw as a flaw), and conveyed where this\r\nseries could go with some talent and some effort. There was little reason to\r\nexpect such a horrendous drop in quality as there is to \u201cViral,\u201d a film that\r\ncontains some of the sloppiest, most ineffective filmmaking I\u2019ve seen all year.  Advertisement Even the wraparound segment doesn\u2019t make any sense. The\r\nfirst two films hinged on old VHS tapes discovered\r\nand then \u201cplayed\u201d for the audience: short films connected\r\nby a wraparound segment. The connective tissue this time is an obnoxious piece\r\nthat seems designed to play off the titular concept of virality in today\u2019s\r\nsocial media world but is just loud, poorly edited and remarkably annoying. You\r\nhave to dig to discern that \u201cV/H/S: Viral\u201d consists of short films with enough\r\nviral content to actually be deadly. Imagine someone screaming at you between\r\nshort films and you have some idea what\u2019s going on here.  Now, the idea that these are viral short films does give the\r\nfilmmakers a bit more freedom in terms of the general restrictions of the found\r\nfootage genre. However, that still\r\ndidn\u2019t excuse half of the \u201cwhy would someone be filming that\u201d choices that\r\nfollow. To say that \u201cV/H/S: Viral\u201d pushes the suspension of disbelief in terms\r\nof found footage would be an understatement. The \u201cZombie Go-Pro\u201d segment in \u201cV/H/S/2\u201d\r\nwas delightfully simple\u2014what if someone had a camera on their head during the\r\nundead apocalypse? All of the filmmakers here would have been well-advised to\r\nfollow that simple-is-better structure. The problems start with the first convoluted mess, \u201cDante\r\nthe Great,\u201d a piece about a magician (Justin Wellborn) who finds a magical cape\r\nand goes power mad with it. Everything about this segment fails. The acting is\r\nunconvincing, the structure is never consistent (are they making a documentary\r\nor is this hidden camera footage?), and the storytelling is unengaging. There\u2019s\r\nnot a single clever, interesting or memorable moment in it. The scariest thing\r\nabout it is that someone thought it was competent enough to be included in a\r\nmajor film. It needed rewrites, recasting, and another round of editing. And it\r\nprobably still wouldn\u2019t have worked. Advertisement The bafflingly low bar set by \u201cDante the Great\u201d makes Nacho\r\nVigalondo\u2019s \u201cParallel Monsters\u201d feel like an oasis in a horror desert. In it, a\r\nmad scientist in his basement opens a door to a parallel reality, where he sees\r\nan identical version of himself. The pair agrees to hop universes for 15\r\nminutes, look around, and come back. He QUICKLY learns that the external\r\nappearance of his doppelganger is the only thing that\u2019s the same on the other\r\nside of that door. This bit has a nice energy and the confidence brought to it\r\nby Vigalondo, but even it ends on a note of disappointment. In comparison to\r\nthe rest of the film, it\u2019s a masterpiece, but even it just misses what I think\r\nVigalondo intended by virtue of being largely one-joke. It\u2019s a good joke, but\r\nit\u2019s still just one joke. And then it\u2019s back into the pit with \u201cBonestorm,\u201d an aggressively\r\nloud and annoying piece about skateboarders who stumble on a cult looking for a\r\nsacrifice. There are only so many shots of skateboard kids slicing and dicing\r\ntheir enemies one can take before we\u2019ve crossed the line from film to something\r\nthat looks more like a video game. I take that back. Most video games are more\r\ncompetently made. Like a lot of horror fans, I'm both more forgiving and more critical of the genre. I know, from experience, that those who love horror movies will often overlook flaws simply because they so badly want their genre to become more respectable and critically acclaimed. Horror fans seek out under-the-radar gems, and embrace their genre's most creative voices. However, it also feels like that blind love for the horror genre can be abused by lazy filmmaking. I get angry when it feels like a fan base is being exploited because, well, \"they'll see it anyway because they liked the last one.\" We've seen this in countless bad horror sequels. And it's exactly what we're seeing here with \"V/H/S: Viral.\"", "Critic": "Beta"}
