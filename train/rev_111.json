{"Title": "How to Dance in Ohio", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Alexandra Shiva\u2019s \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio,\u201d premiering Monday\r\nnight on HBO after a successful festival run, is a tender, compassionate look at\r\nthree young women living life on the autism spectrum. In many ways, it\u2019s a\r\nstellar example of what Roger spoke about when he discussed film as an empathy\r\nmachine, offering insight into lives we may not fully understand. It\u2019s a bit shapeless in terms of filmmaking, but this is a \u201ccharacter\r\ndocumentary,\u201d a study of people that you won\u2019t soon forget, and it works on that level. Advertisement \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio\u201d observes different sessions at Amigo Family Counseling, a center for children, teens\r\nand adults with autism. Dr. Emilio Amigo gently motivates his patients with\r\nchallenges designed to show them that their limitations are not as defined as\r\nthey may think they are. Amigo\u2019s approach can be inspirational far beyond that\r\nof his patients, adopting a style that could be best summed up when he says, \u201cThey will believe they can succeed when they\r\nsucceed.\u201d He doesn\u2019t coddle his patients, but instead sets up challenges\r\nthat he knows they can surpass. Shiva\u2019s whole film works off Amigo\u2019s balance of\r\nempowerment and safety. People with autism often fear for their own security, and\r\nAmigo teaches them that they can be happy, highly functioning and not be\r\nafraid. We can all take something away from when he says, \u201cLet\u2019s give it up for butterflies! That means you\u2019re alive!\u201d Shiva's film chronicles\r\nthe three months leading up to an Amigo Family Counseling Formal Dance. Yes,\r\nhis patients will have to get dressed up, interact, slow dance and even line\r\ndance. If you think about it, a formal dance is a series of social\r\ninteractions, whether they\u2019re dancing in a group with others, asking someone\r\nyou like to cut a rug, or even just socializing around the punch bowl. As\r\nexpected, most of Amigo\u2019s patients are fearful, but they work towards the big\r\nday, wondering who to ask as their date and even going dress-shopping. In particular, Shiva focuses on three women\u2014a 16-year-old named Marideth, a\r\n19-year-old named Caroline and a 22-year-old named Jessica. Labels like\r\nautistic often paint with a broad brush for people who hear them; one\r\nlesson to be learned by \u201cOhio\u201d is the notable differences between these three\r\nyoung ladies. Marideth seems to just be coming out of her shell. Her parents\r\nnote that they only get two minutes of conversation, but that\u2019s two minutes\r\nmore than they used to get. She\u2019s unpredictable in her degree of confidence,\r\ntelling Shiva that she likes to research and then shutting down when asked what she likes to research. Caroline has a boyfriend she met in Amigo\u2019s class, and\r\nshe\u2019s going to other classes, but is nervous about taking the bus to get there.\r\nJessica gets the most screen time, and she\u2019s close to being completely\r\nindependent, even working a bakery, although she sometimes struggles with\r\nco-workers.  Advertisement How will I know what to say to someone when they talk to me?\r\nHow will I know if someone is joking? What do I say when I\u2019m nervous? Most people\r\nwith autism can\u2019t inherently and instinctually respond to social cues like you\r\nor me. And \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio\u201d deftly captures that aspect of the condition.\r\nWe see Marideth, Caroline and Jessica taking small steps forward, although the\r\nfilm is careful not to present their condition as something that needs a cure.\r\nIt\u2019s just a fact of their lives, something they use Dr. Amigo\u2019s class to\r\nmanage. The best elements of \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio\u201d don\u2019t feel like a\r\ndisease-of-the-week documentary\u2014on the contrary, they illuminate the\r\ncommonality we\u2019ve all faced at a difficult job or nerve-inducing formal dance.\r\nWe\u2019ve all felt those butterflies. And that means we\u2019re alive.", "Critic": "Beta"}
