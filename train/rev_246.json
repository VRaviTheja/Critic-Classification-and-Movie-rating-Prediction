{"Title": "Lost River", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The reviews for Ryan Gosling\u2019s directorial debut in \u201cLost\r\nRiver\u201d (which he also wrote) out of Cannes last year were so vitriolic and\r\ndownright hateful that I expected some sort of narcissistic variation on \u201cThe Room\u201d.\r\nThe good news is that \u201cLost River\u201d is far from horrible; there are too many\r\ninteresting ideas and strong visual compositions to write it off completely,\r\nand it\u2019s actually kind of bizarre that so many people did so on the Riviera.\r\nThe bad news is that it still doesn\u2019t quite work, largely because Gosling has\r\nbitten off more than he can chew, assembling ideas and images without the\r\ndirectorial vision to connect them. His film was clearly influenced by Nicolas\r\nWinding Refn, David Lynch and Terrence Malick, and one gets the distinct impression\r\nthat mimicking filmmakers with such confident visual sensibilities may not have\r\nbeen the best way for a rookie director to get his feet wet. The result is a\r\npiece with images that connect only superficially, never finding the thematic\r\nresonance of a Lynch or Malick vision. Gosling\u2019s eye is too confident to\r\nignore, but one hopes he points it at a more-engaging product next time. Advertisement \u201cLost River\u201d takes place in a totally desolate and\r\nnearly-destroyed Detroit, in which Billy (Christina Hendricks) and her son\r\nBones (Iain De Caestecker) struggle to make ends meet. She\u2019s three months\r\nbehind on the mortgage payments; he spends his days scrounging burned-out\r\nbuildings for copper. In the world of \u201cLost River\u201d, there are predators\r\neverywhere for people already on the edge of society; people who exist to pull\r\nthem into the abyss. Billy\u2019s comes in the form of the new employee she meets at\r\nthe bank named Dave (Ben Mendolsohn), who has a proposition for her to make\r\nmore money. Bones\u2019 comes in the form of Bully (Matt Smith), a freakish villain\r\nwho drives around town with a megaphone warning those considering stealing his\r\ncopper that they better \u201clook at his muscles\u201d first.  Exhausting all of her options, Billy takes up Dave\u2019s offer\r\nto work at an exclusive, hidden nightclub, at which female performers pretend\r\nto mutilate and disfigure themselves. Run by the charismatic Cat (Eva Mendes),\r\nevery night\u2019s show includes paying customers who just want to be washed in the\r\nfake blood of beautiful women. And, of course, there\u2019s something even more\r\nnefarious, but more profitable, for Billy in the basement of this disturbing\r\nestablishment. Dave tells Billy that he goes town to town, setting up these\r\nexhibitions of violence, even in poor areas, and makes a fortune. The\r\ncommentary on mass-produced re-creations of horror is a bit underlined and\r\nhighlighted, but it leads to some striking imagery, including Hendricks\r\ncasually taking off her face. Meanwhile, Bones\u2019 only friend Rat (Saoirse Ronan) tells him\r\nabout an underwater city, at the bottom of the reservoir. The story goes that\r\nthe modern Atlantis was flooded, and the submerging of it led to a curse on the\r\npeople above. Bones becomes convinced he needs to retrieve an item from there\r\nto lift the curse and bring happiness to Billy and Rat.  From early on, it\u2019s clear that Gosling is not concerned with\r\ntraditional narrative, as much as he is fever dream filmmaking, enhanced by a\r\nRefn-esque techno score and imagery that conveys directorial intention more\r\nthan dialogue. After searching for copper, Bones sees a bicycle on fire roll\r\nby. It is an image that only exists in film but it makes clear the\r\ndangerous world that Gosling is trying to capture. In this environment, Bones\u2019 little brother thinks there are monsters in his room. Gosling is visually conveying that there are\r\nmonsters everywhere, waiting to grab people who have run out of options.  Advertisement The problems with Golsing's film exist in that tried-and-true line between being\r\nmysterious & symbolic and just being self-indulgent. The best elements of \u201cLost\r\nRiver\u201d approach near fairy tale tones. There\u2019s a spell that needs to be broken,\r\na man who is missing part of his face, a grandmother who remains mute\u2014these feel\r\nlike beats from Grimm more than anything else. But Gosling doesn\u2019t have a grip\r\non them, and the film reverts back to Malick-esque scenes of lyricism and then into\r\nrelatively straightforward scenes of dialogue. In fact, those scenes, such as\r\nthe first between Hendricks and Mendelsohn, are the best in the film. Gosling\r\ndefinitely has a nice touch with actors, he just buries in them in so much\r\ncluttered, cinematic noise that they get lost themselves. And he really muddles\r\nthe ending, as we need more definition as to what is actually happening in a\r\nfew key climactic moments if we\u2019re expected to care, which I believe we are. I believe. It's hard to say what exactly Gosling wants us to take away from his debut. I am very curious to see what he does next, now that he's made an \"everything and the kitchen sink\" film of his most beloved influences. For now, \u201cLost River\u201d is one of those weird films that I think\r\nsome people will absolutely adore, grabbing on to its performances, imagery,\r\nand ideas, without really caring that they haven\u2019t been stitched together in an\r\ninteresting enough way.", "Critic": "Beta"}
