{"Title": "Unbroken", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Films like \u201cUnbroken,\u201d and the Laura Hillenbrand book on\r\nwhich it\u2019s based, capture something we all hope is true about ourselves\u2014that we too are unbreakable. That when faced with horrendous, life-threatening\r\nsituations, we would respond in similar fashion to Louis Zamperini, finding a\r\nnew well of courage within ourselves and surviving the unimaginable. It is the\r\nresilience of the human spirit that has drawn us to films based on true stories\r\nagain and again to experience pain and triumph in the relative comfort of a\r\nmovie theater seat.  Advertisement \u201cUnbroken\u201d opens with a powerfully staged and shot sequence of\r\naerial combat that surprisingly defines the film's strengths and weaknesses over\r\nthe next two-plus hours. The attention to detail as Zamperini (Jack O\u2019Connell),\r\nRussell \u2018Phil\u2019 Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson) and Hugh \u2018Cup\u2019 Cuppernell (Jai\r\nCourtney) spin their plane around and take aim at the enemy feels accurate.\r\nThere\u2019s a weight to the gunfire and a fragility to the aircraft itself that\r\nconveys that these people were always a more-accurate gunsight away from\r\ntragedy. And yet there\u2019s something wrong here too. The sunset on the horizon looks\r\nlike a painting. The clouds are perfectly placed for visual impact. The little drop of blood on Zamperini\u2019s forehead can\u2019t hide\r\nhis movie star looks or movie star make-up. Everything feels accurate in its\r\nstaging, and yet also not quite genuine. It's Hollywood, old-fashioned movie accurate. And despite O\u2019Connell\u2019s instant charisma (the\r\nguy is going to be a MASSIVE star), this feeling never leaves \u201cUnbroken\u201d\u2014the sense\r\nthat we\u2019re watching human suffering that looks too pretty and too refined to\r\nconvey its intended impact. Louis Zamperini should have become a household name for his\r\nathletic ability. The \u201cTorrance Tornado\u201d was a US Olympic athlete whose career\r\nwas cut short when he joined World War II as a bombardier. Even in country,\r\nZamperini is seen training, pushing himself right at the moment that most\r\npeople would give up. He is the kind of runner who hangs back, and only makes\r\nhis move when everyone has reached the point of exhaustion. Of course, this is\r\na character trait that will serve him well during the nightmare he\u2019s about to\r\nendure. Zamperini and two other men, including Phil, survive a plane crash in the\r\nmiddle of the Pacific Ocean. They barely make it long enough to board a raft,\r\nwhere the conditions of hunger, dehydration and heat exhaustion take their\r\ntoll. These scenes are remarkably well-staged and executed by director Angelina Jolie\r\nand her team. They\u2019re the best in the film, the moments in which we can feel\r\nZamperini\u2019s increasing desperation and likely death. They have a focus, fragility and purpose that the second half of the film lacks. Advertisement That begins when Zamperini is captured after 47 days adrift,\r\nand forced into horrific conditions and hard labor in Japanese Prisoner of War\r\ncamps. Here, Jolie simply fails to convey the danger and what\u2019s truly at stake. \u201cUnbroken\u201d\r\nstarts to go through the motions of history recreation instead of real character drama, and while I have loved Roger Deakins\u2019 work in\r\nthe past, it\u2019s too \u201cpretty\u201d here, covering every shot in that vague beige of\r\nWWII memory, which never allows us to put ourselves in Zamperini\u2019s speedy shoes. If we\r\ncan\u2019t feel the urgency of his plight, we won\u2019t have the same emotional response\r\nto it as we would with more blood, more dirt, and just more danger. It becomes\r\nsomething we watch instead of something we experience. There's a difference. The relative disappointment of \u201cUnbroken\u201d has nothing to do with\r\nJack O\u2019Connell, a truly gifted actor who has emerged as a fully-formed movie\r\nstar with this, his even better work in \u201cStarred Up,\u201d and next year\u2019s great \u201c\u201971.\u201d\r\nHe may not be a household name yet. He will be. In fact, he\u2019s so good that one\r\nwishes Jolie asked more of him. Gleeson also deserves praise for taking a\r\nsmaller role and making it memorable. He too is an actor really worth watching.\r\n\u201cUnbroken\u201d could be a film that we look back on as an early entry in the\r\ncareers of major stars. Because the disappointing thing is we won\u2019t really look back\r\nat the film itself on its own merits. It\u2019s one of those inspirational Hollywood\r\ndramas about which there isn\u2019t anything \"overtly wrong\" with it. It\u2019s well-cast,\r\nit looks great, it has that intense centerpiece in the raft, and it certainly\r\nconveys a true story worth telling. And yet I keep coming back to that\r\nbeautiful sunrise that opens the film. It\u2019s just too damn pretty.", "Critic": "Beta"}
