{"Title": "The Ticket", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "There\u2019s a story told several times in Ido Fluk\u2019s \u201cThe Ticket.\u201d It opens the film and is repeated by its protagonist, James (Dan Stevens, riding a hot streak with FX\u2019s \u201cLegion\u201d and the smash hit remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d). It goes roughly like this: A man prays every day to win the lottery. He does this for years. Eventually, an angel goes to God and says, \u201cCan\u2019t we just let him win finally?\u201d And God says, \u201cI\u2019d love to. But he\u2019s never bought a ticket.\u201d At one point, James\u2019 friend Bob (Oliver Platt) tells James that he doesn\u2019t get the story he\u2019s been telling over and over again. I\u2019m not quite sure the movie gets the story it\u2019s trying to tell either. It\u2019s just one of those films that one is constantly wishing would coalesce into something tangible and concrete, but it keeps slipping through your fingers. Like the parable that James arguably doesn\u2019t understand, one wants \u201cThe Ticket\u201d to strike harder, take more chances, and simply be more memorable. Advertisement James was blind yesterday. He is not today. He wakes up in the opening scenes of the films to a bright, vibrant world that he can see. His doctors have little explanation as to why his pituitary gland has shrunk, allowing him to see again. His supportive wife Sam (Malin Akerman) is understandably floored by the revelation\u2014although Fluk and co-writer Sharon Mashihi don\u2019t do nearly enough to ground or define the relationship. I understand the desire to open the film on the day that James can see\u2014it allows for the camera to replicate his blurry vision coming into focus\u2014but the movie relies a lot on telling us about James & Sam\u2019s relationship instead of showing us their foundation before James\u2019 new gift creates cracks in it. The first crack comes when James notices that his son Jonah (Skylar Gaertner) has a black eye. It\u2019s the kind of thing he notes that Sam wouldn\u2019t have told him about and he never would have known about a bully situation at his school. The implication, more than once, is that Sam has been controlling James, and now she can\u2019t be in charge as much as she used to be. The second crack comes when James notices that co-worker Jessica (Kerry Bish\u00e9) is stunningly beautiful. And Jessica starts to grow attracted to James as well when the newly confident young man becomes a shark at the office. James works for a company that buys real estate at cheap prices from people in a position where they need to sell. And he develops a rather insidious way to bilk people of their property that\u2019s basically a con job in which James gives speeches about financial advice that attempt to push them toward selling. So, in relatively short order, James becomes superficial. Or does he? Was James always kind of an asshole and sight only makes that part of his personality easier to feed? Again, this is an interesting angle into the story of \u201cThe Ticket\u201d that\u2019s left relatively unexplored, partially because of the structure of the piece, but more because it feels like Fluk & Mashihi are just too hesitant to really make James a villain. If you\u2019re going to tell the story of a man who tears his seemingly-good life apart when he\u2019s given a gift from God, we need to feel the joy of the gift and the pain of the fall. This is essentially an Icarus tale without the feeling of flight or the sensation of burning. Advertisement So why bother at all? Well, Dan Stevens is gonna be something big. It was kind of clear on \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d and \u201cThe Guest,\u201d but his work in \u201cLegion\u201d and this mark another step up the career ladder. He imbues James with layers of back-story and subtext that keep the film working in spite of its narrative thinness. Like his character\u2019s ability to sell a bad deal, Stevens is one of those actors who is so charismatic that they can sell a bad movie. One only wishes the rest of the film knew what to do with him.", "Critic": "Beta"}
