{"Title": "Bessie", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "HBO\u2019s \u201cBessie,\u201d premiering Saturday on the network, is a\r\nflawed drama that nonetheless warrants a look simply because of the bright\r\nspotlight it gives the underrated talents of star Queen Latifah, who does quite\r\neasily the best work of her career here. This sexually-charged, intense look at\r\nBlues icon Bessie Smith often feels defiantly episodic, as if\r\nco-writer/director Dee Rees is purposefully trying to sketch a portrait of a\r\nlife in incomplete brush strokes, but Latifah, who is in nearly every scene,\r\nnever falters in her portrayal of a woman who was too edgy, too real, and too\r\ntough to be famous before the world came crashing down around her.  Advertisement In the first full scene of \u201cBessie,\u201d the title character\r\n(Queen Latifah) is getting hot and heavy in an alley when her paramour goes a grope\r\ntoo far and starts to get violent when she refuses. She does not give in, grabbing\r\na glass shard off the pavement and stabbing her attacker, before going on stage\r\nto sing a number. Bessie takes no shit from anyone. Even those who would offer\r\nher good advice or further her career are often pushed aside by pride and ego\r\nas much as artistic integrity. Across most of \u201cBessie,\u201d we see the title\r\ncharacter confronting authority, patriarchy, the white male establishment, etc.\r\nShe is presented with an opportunity to find a broader audience but compromise\u2014she\r\nrefuses. She encounters a violent KKK sect trying to shut down a performance\u2014she\r\nmeets violence with violence. In one great moment, Langston Hughes warns her to\r\n\u201cplay\u201d to her white, snooty crowd before she heads into a party to perform. She\r\nshoots him down with a glance. Bessie Smith was a vaudeville smash in the 1920s, successful\r\nenough to have her own train on which she toured the country, and to inspire\r\nNina Simone and Billie Holliday. She rose to fame purely through talent and\r\nsheer will, but demons like addiction and the ceiling she eventually hit by\r\nrefusing to bend to the will of white producers kept her out of the spotlight,\r\nand even sunk her so low that her family was threatened. \u201cBessie\u201d hides none of\r\nSmith\u2019s demons or resilience. Reportedly in the making for 22 years from a\r\nscript by Horton Foote, it\u2019s easy to see why \u201cBessie\u201d was a film inevitability.\r\nThis is a great story of a relatively unheralded talent.  And everyone involved should be grateful that Queen Latifah\r\nagreed to take on this challenging role, one that she had reportedly been\r\ncircling for over a decade. She is powerful, fearless, and, when needed,\r\nvulnerable in a role that could easily win her an Emmy and a Golden Globe.\r\nCriticisms of \u201cBessie\u201d fall away when this performance is considered,\r\nespecially when one balances the emotional intensity of the final act with the\r\nbravado of the first two. Bessie never feels like a dramatic creation; she\r\nresonates with truth, whether it be in the longing that led her to multiple\r\naffairs (including ones with characters played by Mike Epps and Tika Sumpter),\r\nor in her downright allergic reactions to what she saw as fakeness in her profession.\r\nBlues legend Ma Rainey (Mo\u2019Nique) tells Smith early on, \u201cYou got to put something else in it. The blues is not about people\r\nknowing you, it\u2019s about you knowing people.\u201d Queen Latifah really got to\r\nknow Bessie Smith in ways that other actresses couldn\u2019t have.  Advertisement Sometimes scripts that have been around as long as \u201cBessie\u201d\r\nget over-worked, over-edited, over-analyzed to the point that they lose some of\r\nthat screenwriting \u201cmagic.\u201d The first half of \u201cBessie\u201d feels a bit too\r\ncalculated, too episodic in a way designed to give Latifah and her co-stars\r\n(including the great Michael K. Williams) the right number of big moments\r\nwithout linking them together in the arc of a life. And regular TV cinematographer Jeffrey Jur shoots too much of the film like a TV movie. It doesn't have the cinematic scope or visual language I wish it did outside of the musical numbers. As for storytelling, I found myself too often asking, especially in the first half, \"What are we supposed\r\nto take away from this story?\" Maybe nothing. Maybe we're just supposed to know more about an underrated musical icon. For that reason, \u201cBessie\u201d is best appreciated as a character/performance\r\npiece. Like you would if you went to an actual Blues concert, just enjoy the\r\nstar in the spotlight, sharing some of herself and some of the visions of her\r\nsongwriters in every note.", "Critic": "Beta"}
