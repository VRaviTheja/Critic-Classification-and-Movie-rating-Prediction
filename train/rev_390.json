{"Title": "Whiplash", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Whiplash\" is cinematic adrenalin. In an era when\r\nso many films feel more refined by focus groups or marketing managers, it is a deeply personal and vibrantly alive drama. Damien Chazelle has taken a relatively staid subject like the\r\nrelationship between a music student and his teacher and turned it into a\r\nthriller built on a brilliant undercurrent of social commentary about what it\r\ntakes to make it in an increasingly competitive and cutthroat world. How far\r\nare you willing to push yourself to succeed? How far are you willing to push\r\nsomeone else to force them on the path to success? Carried by two electric\r\nperformances, the tightest editing in a film this year and a daring screenplay\r\nthat writes itself into a corner and then somehow finds an unexpected way out, \"Whiplash\" is as\r\nbreathless as a drum solo, rising and falling just as the\r\nhopes and dreams of its protagonist climb and crash.  Advertisement A young man named Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) is practicing\r\nlate at night at his New York music school, one of the best in the country,\r\nwhen his drumming catches the ear of the infamous Mr. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons),\r\nthe most important teacher at the school and the conductor for its most\r\nimportant jazz band. Fletcher pauses, listens, barks a few orders at the young\r\nman, and moves on, seemingly dissatisfied with what he heard. Andrew had his\r\nchance, that one brief moment many of us have to impress the people who can\r\nchange our lives, and he didn't cut it. He goes back to his routine class band,\r\ntelling his dad (a wonderfully genuine Paul Reiser) that his opportunity to\r\nmove up probably passed him by. Of course, Fletcher's dismissal of Andrew in that first scene\r\nis just the first of many examples of what could politely be called his\r\n\"teaching style.\" Fletcher likes to tell the apocryphal story of how\r\nJo Jones threw a cymbal at Charlie Parker's head one night when he messed up,\r\nthereby pushing him to the breaking point at which he became Bird. Without that\r\ncymbal, would music history be the same? Would Charlie Parker have gone home,\r\nrefined, practiced and driven himself without the threat of not just failure\r\nbut physical violence? Fletcher uses that kind of barbarous technique\r\non his students: throwing furniture, calling Andrew names, playing mind games\r\nand physically torturing him with repetitive drum solos until he bleeds on the\r\nkit. But that blood feeds his musical passion. And Andrew blossoms, asking out\r\nthe cute girl he's been afraid to talk to before, and taking first chair in the\r\nmost important band at the most important music school in the country. Miles Teller, so great in breakthrough roles in \u201cRabbit Hole\u201d\r\nand \u201cThe Spectacular Now,\u201d does the best work of his young career here as Andrew, finding\r\nthe perfect blend of insecurity and confidence that comes entangled in the core\r\nof a young talent. Andrew is naturally apprehensive, but he also knows he has a\r\ndrive, a passion, a skill that is unique. Teller walks that line, never\r\nfaltering by making Andrew too confident while also carefully letting viewers\r\nsee the spark within that Fletcher fuels. Advertisement As for Simmons, Fletcher could have been such\r\na caricature in the wrong actor\u2019s hands. An over-the-top, abusive teacher is a part riddled with pitfalls. Simmons falls into none of them. He walks\r\nsuch a line that, even after the kind of inhumane mind games and physical abuse\r\nthat should produce legal charges has unfolded on screen, we find ourselves\r\ndrawn to Fletcher. He\u2019s not 100% wrong when he says that the most dangerous two\r\nwords in the English language are \u201cgood job.\u201d Whether you think it's the right approach or not, we\u2019re in an era of praise,\r\nwhere encouragement is the teaching tool and every kid gets a medal for participation. Have true talents been left to wither because they were over-watered?\r\nSimmons perfectly captures the drive of a man who believes his abusive degree\r\nof pressure is the only way to produce a diamond. While \u201cWhiplash\u201d would be a notable film purely for Teller\r\nand Simmons\u2019 performances, it reaches a different level when one considers the\r\nexecution of its tempo. Editor Tom Cross and cinematographer Sharone Meir often\r\nput us right on stage with Andrew and Fletcher, cutting and panning in rhythm with\r\nthe beat of the drum. It is captivating, to say the least, particularly in a\r\nclimax that produces more tension than any action film or thriller this year.\r\nThe title refers to a song played multiple times throughout Chazelle\u2019s film. It\r\ncould also refer to that sense of wowed exhaustion you\u2019ll feel when it\u2019s over.", "Critic": "Beta"}
