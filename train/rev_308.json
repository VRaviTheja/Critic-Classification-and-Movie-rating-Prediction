{"Title": "Annabelle", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "A word of advice for horror movie producers: If you\u2019re going\r\nto riff on \u201870s horror classics like \u201cThe Omen\u201d and \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby,\u201d make\r\nsure to look more deeply at why those films connected with viewers rather than just stealing their imagery. Merely mimicking\r\nthem aesthetically is a hollow exercise, and proof that you don\u2019t understand\r\nthat horror is more than a series of jump cuts and frightening images. Horror,\r\nat its best, taps into something deeper.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing deep about \u201cAnnabelle,\u201d\r\nthe spin-off of \u201cThe Conjuring.\u201d It offers\u00a0surface level scares without the undercurrent\r\nof humanity needed to make them register. Director John R. Leonetti and writer Gary Dauberman\u00a0work proficiently enough on a technical level to craft a few scenes that get the\r\nheart racing, but the climax of \u201cAnnabelle\u201d is so misguided, silly and even offensive that any excuse genre fans may be\r\ninclined to make for the mediocre hour-and-a half that precedes it will likely turn to rage. \u00a0 Advertisement For the record\u2014and it\u2019s worth noting because of how angry\r\nour original review of \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d still makes fans of that film\u2014I was a fan of James Wan\u2019s 2013 ghost story. The director took a giant leap forward in that\r\nwork, proving he understands numerous elements that modern horror directors\r\nignore, such as the use of sound\r\ndesign and setting to create tension. These elements are discarded in \u201cAnnabelle.\" If you saw the 2013 hit, you remember the creepy doll that wouldn\u2019t go away. Ghostbusters Lorraine and Ed Warren kept Annabelle in a\r\nlocked case, recognizing the true evil held within. How did Annabelle go from a\r\nrelatively harmless but totally creepy doll to a tool of the devil? \u201cAnnabelle\u201d\r\ntries to tell that story, using the Manson Murders and \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d as a\r\nbackdrop. Some may be tempted to write off \u201cAnnabelle\u201d on concept alone, in\r\nthat it\u2019s something of a cash grab, like a straight-to-video sequel\r\ndesigned to strike while a hit predecessor's iron is still hot. Still, I would argue\r\nthat \u201cAnnabelle\u201d has the core of a good film within it. It's about how changing times in the \u201870s, when otherwise safe neighborhood dwellers\r\nstarted locking their doors and apartment denizens began to suspect their\r\nneighbors; the iconography of youth became sinister.\r\nYou can sense shreds of this idea in \u201cAnnabelle,\u201d but the film doesn't develop them. We learn that Annabelle was owned by a lovely young couple\r\nnamed Mia (Annabelle Wallis) and John (Ward Horton). In the run-up to the birth of their first child,\u00a0John gave his wife the\r\ndoll as a part of her extensive collection. As Mia nears her due date, the couple faces unimaginable\r\nhorror in the form of a pair of Satanic cultists who break in, stab Mia in the\r\nbelly, and end up dead in their home. The female cultist happens to be named\r\nAnnabelle Higgins, and some of her blood lands on the doll Annabelle. Before\r\nyou know it, Mia is seeing shadowy figures on the stairs, hearing noises in the\r\nnight and realizing that something evil wants her baby.  Thematically, nothing in \u201cAnnabelle\u201d is developed beyond a level that might make it suitable for horror movie manipulations. When we meet religious characters like Father Perez (Tony Amendola), \u201cAnnabelle\u201d threatens to take on some \"The Exorcist\" or \"The Omen\"-like undertones, chronicling a time when some felt that Americans lost touch with their religious institutions. But the movie doesn\u2019t really go\r\nthere. When no one believes Mia\u2019s haunting stories, \u201cAnnabelle\u201d threatens to\r\nbecome a piece about how new mothers can be ignored, their concerns portrayed as the byproduct of hormones. But this notion isn't developed, either. \u00a0 Advertisement There are other problems. Wallis and Horton are remarkably\r\nunengaging leads. She mumbles, he over-emotes, and the doll is allowed to steal\r\nscenes. And the film is visually flat. Pan reveals (panning across a door or\r\nroom to reveal something in the background) are over-used, and the sound is\r\nmixed to grating levels. It\u2019s a movie that screams \"Boo!\" instead of trying to get under your skin. There is one great set piece involving a storage unit in the\r\nbasement and an elevator that just won\u2019t leave it, but that\u2019s something you can\r\nwatch on cable later, while ignoring the weak film that surrounds it.", "Critic": "Beta"}
