{"Title": "24 Days", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Playing cat and mouse with kidnappers can be a grisly and\r\nawful business even if\u00ad\u2014or maybe the phrase should be \u201cparticularly if\u201d\u2014the\r\nkidnappers are dumb as dirt. That\u2019s one of the takeaways of \u201c24 Days,\u201d a\r\nwell-engineered suspense drama from France directed by Alexandre Arcady. The\r\nmovie, starring Zabou Breitman, Jacque Gamblin, Pascal Elb\u00e9, Sylvie Testud, and\r\nTony Harrisson, has a more upsetting dimension than most suspense dramas as\r\nit\u2019s based on a true story, a story that touches on issues still roiling France\r\ntoday.  Advertisement The movie begins with Breitman, in the role of Ruth Halimi,\r\ndirectly addressing the camera, and asking, \u201cHow could this happen in France in\r\n2006?\u201d The kidnapping of Halimi\u2019s son, Ilan, is what happened to begin with.\r\nArcady shows Ilan\u2019s family preparing for a group meal and going into loud shock\r\non learning of Ilan\u2019s abduction; particularly searing is the photo of Ilan with\r\nhis eyes and mouth duct-taped, with a gun to his head. Ruth and her ex-husband\r\nDidier (Elb\u00e9) go to the police. The head of the investigation, Delcour\r\n(Gamblin), is competent and highly invested, as is his crew, as is the\r\npsychologist/negotiation expert Brigitte Farrell (Testud) who works with Didier\r\non the phone calls from the ransom-demander whose name they don\u2019t know yet. His\r\nminions, underclass kids of all ethnicities, know him as \u201cDjango,\u201d and they\r\ndon\u2019t dare cross him.\u00a0 But Django, whose real name is Fofana, and who shuttles\r\nbetween Paris and his ancestral home of the Ivory Coast of Africa, isn\u2019t quite\r\nas much of a mastermind as he conceives himself. His original scheme was to\r\nkidnap a Jew, a strategy borne not so much out of race hate per se (although\r\nit\u2019s there) as a conviction that, good grief, \u201cJews have all the money.\u201d Not\r\nonly do they have all the money, but also they stick together and bail out\r\ntheir own. As it happens none of the Halimis are rich, or even particularly\r\naffluent. But Fofana\u2019s accomplices are pretty dim, and pretty sadistic. And as\r\nthe captivity drags on, Ruth is reminded of the case of Daniel Pearl. When\r\nFofana taunts the victim\u2019s parents with a reading from the Koran, it\u2019s a\r\nparticularly sick-making moment.  Arcady\u2019s direction is tight and efficient throughout (the\r\nsecond unit was handled by Alexandre Aja, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Arcady\u2014his son,\r\nto be precise\u2014who\u2019s made an, um, interesting career in American horror\r\npictures) and overstated at times, although by Hollywood standard his modes of\r\noverstatement (slow motion shots of characters turning around as they make\r\nsudden terrifying realizations, and so on) are almost subtle! But his handling\r\nof the story\u2019s very ugly twists and turns, particularly as the appalling Fofana\r\ngrows more truculent in his demands, is unimpeachable. As for its social\r\nanalysis, it\u2019s tough for non-residents of France to judge it. It\u2019s pretty clear\r\nthat the film falls squarely on the side of Ruth, who campaigned for the\r\nauthorities to acknowledge that anti-Semitism was at least an aggravating\r\nfactor in the case. And of course anti-Semitism is a French cultural issue\r\ngoing back to even before the Dreyfus case. These days the country has\r\nimmigration, so-called radical Islam, and other factors in this mix.\u00a0 Advertisement The finale\r\nof the movie could arguably be said to offload the anti-Semitism concern onto a\r\nnon-French-born person of color, which may strike some social-justice-sensitive\r\ntypes as\u2026what\u2019s the word?...\u201dproblematic.\u201d Sometimes the problem with finding\r\nthings \u201cproblematic\u201d is the fact staring you in the face: Fofana the individual\r\ndid, as it happened, do all the awful things of which he was accused. His last\r\nwords in the film are \u201cF**k France, bitches,\u201d which, yes, in the context of\r\nthis presentation are pretty \u201con the nose.\u201d On the other hand, it sounds like\r\nsomething the real-life Fofana would actually say.
