{"Title": "Draft Day", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The first round of the 2013 NFL Draft on ESPN was watched by\r\nmore than 6 million people. It\u2019s an amazing number when one considers\r\nthe history of a process in which winners and losers won't be defined for years to come. These are viewers, most of them diehard fans, engaged\r\nin a prospect, a dream, a chance for a better future for their team. Will their\r\nfirst-round pick be Andrew Luck or Ryan Leaf? Every decision is analyzed to the\r\npoint of exhaustion as the popularity of the NFL is rarely more pronounced than\r\nin the fact that people are more interested in players who might hit the field\r\nin four months than those actually playing hockey, basketball, and baseball that\r\nvery day. And it creates a pressure cooker atmosphere for those actually tasked\r\nwith trying to separate the Leafs from the Lucks. Rabid fans make for tense\r\nexecutives. When Donovan McNabb was drafted over Texas phenom Ricky Williams in\r\nthe 1999 draft, Philadelphia almost collectively lost its mind. Make a mistake\r\nat the draft and you might not be around as long as the player you just picked.\r\n Advertisement The \u201cWar Room\u201d environment of decision-making on the day of\r\nthe NFL draft was too enticing for Hollywood to avoid for long, and so the\r\nstar-studded and cameo-heavy \u201cDraft Day\u201d arrives to offer viewers a behind-the-scenes\r\nlook at how an NFL team can be broken or salvaged with just a series of\r\nnegotiations and player assessments. Both too \u201cinside baseball\u201d for non-NFL\r\nfans to care and not nearly character-driven enough at the same time, Ivan\r\nReitman\u2019s film is cluttered, noisy, and often nonsensical. Reitman lacks\r\nconfidence in the script by Rajiv Joseph & Scott Rothman (and probably\r\nshould) and so he uses more split-screen than an episode of \u201c24\u201d in an attempt\r\nto make a flat story pop.  Sonny Weaver, Jr. (Kevin Costner) is having the kind of\r\nstressful month that only happens in the movies. He\u2019s the general manager of\r\nthe long-suffering Cleveland Browns, and has to choose between a hothead linebacker\r\nnamed Vontae Mack (Chadwick Boseman) and a troubled running back named Ray\r\nJennings (Houston Texans star Arian Foster) with the team\u2019s #7 pick. Sonny\u2019s\r\nnamesake was the beloved coach of the Browns for years and just passed away in\r\nthe last week. Because grief over his father\u2019s passing, job tension, and the\r\ndraft pick weren\u2019t enough for the screenwriters, the film opens with the\r\nrevelation that Sonny\u2019s girlfriend Ali (Jennifer Garner) happens to be\r\npregnant. Of course, Ali works with Sonny and their romance has been\r\n(relatively) secret. Not enough movie for you? Sonny\u2019s day becomes significantly more\r\nintense when the Seattle Seahawks call and offer to trade down their #1 pick to\r\nthe Browns. Weaver knows he needs to make a splash (and is literally told as\r\nmuch in a horrendously-scripted scene with his boss, Frank Langella\u2019s Anthony\r\nMolina) and so he chooses to trade his future for his present, giving the next\r\nthree first-round picks to Seattle for the chance to draft Wisconsin superstar\r\nBo Callahan (Josh Pence). His coach (Denis Leary) loses his mind and Sonny\r\nspends the rest of the day trying to figure out how to turn his draft around\u2026and\r\nhis life, of course. Advertisement \u201cDraft Day\u201d is well-cast. Costner has the world-weariness of a man losing sleep over college kids and job security. Langella and Leary\r\nknow how to push the right buttons when it comes to turning up the heat on our\r\nprotagonist. Supporting roles feel well-considered, including scene-stealers\r\nlike W. Earl Brown, Terry Crews, Sam Elliott, and Ellen Burstyn. And yet all of these interesting performers can't save a dull script. To work, \u201cDraft Day\u201d needs the kind of witty dialogue and\r\nsnappy energy that Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin brought to \u201cMoneyball\u201d but the screenwriters mistake constant activity for actual screenwriting.\r\nEveryone serves a plot purpose in this cluttered tale instead of playing an\r\nactual person: \"the girlfriend,\" \"the coach,\" \"the mom,\" \"the agent,\" \"the owner,\" and so on.\r\nThey are archetypes and often fail to feel realistic even in that regard. Langella\u2019s Art Modell\r\nriff (it\u2019s no coincidence he has the same initials as the legendary Browns\r\nowner who moved the team to Baltimore in the \u201890s) is a caricature, Burstyn\r\npops up just to manipulatively tug at heartstrings, and the romance between\r\nCostner & Garner contains zero chemistry. As if he could tell that he had a shallow script, Reitman does\r\nhis best to make it all seem more interesting than it is with visual tricks.\r\nCharacters cross split screens, creating a truly odd aesthetic in which it looks\r\nlike people in separate cities are sharing the same space while talking on the\r\nphone. The on-screen ticking clock counting down to the\r\ndraft, the pomp and circumstance of NFL logos every time a new team comes into\r\nthe narrative; these are the kind of filmmaking tricks that might have enhanced\r\na quality script but feel like a lot of window-dressing with this one. In\r\nessence, it\u2019s not dissimilar to what ESPN does with the actual draft, pumping\r\nit up with fanfare, high-tech graphics, and on-screen stats to give the viewer\r\nthe impression they\u2019re watching something truly important.  What \u201cDraft Day\u201d\r\nmisses is that the reason 6 million people watch the actual draft is because it\u2019s\r\nmerely the prelude to the story of their team and possibly their new favorite\r\nplayer, and not the whole story in itself. We buy into the dream because of what it could mean for our sports\r\nfandom. The movie about this phenomenon clutters that hope with too many characters\r\ninvolved in uninteresting (and often unbelievable) subplots, dragging the high\r\nthat true sports fans feel on draft day to the ground.
