{"Title": "Run All Night", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Ditching the twisting high concepts of works like \u201cUnknown\u201d\r\n(amnesia!) and \u201cNon-Stop\u201d (one flight!), action star Liam Neeson and director Jaume\r\nCollet-Serra have crafted their most satisfying work to date by sticking to a\r\ntried-and-true crime movie template, and allowing a talented cast and tight\r\nproduction values to be the only high concept they need. \u201cRun All Night\u201d isn\u2019t\r\nperfect, but it\u2019s surprisingly satisfying on its own terms, elevated by a\r\nbetter-than-average ensemble and some razor-sharp editing to cut through any\r\nnagging questions about the plot. More than he\u2019s been allowed to do in either\r\nCollet-Serra vehicle before this one, Neeson gets to portray a real character\r\nhere, a man who may have once had a particular set of skills but has seen then\r\ndulled by age, regret and whiskey. \u201cRun All Night\u201d is proof that quality action\r\nfilms don\u2019t really need to reinvent the wheel each time out as long as they\r\nmake it spin this smoothly. Advertisement Jimmy Conlon (Neeson) used to be a notorious mob enforcer.\r\nIf he knocked on your door, you knew you were in trouble. Rumored to be behind\r\nover a dozen murders at the behest of the infamous Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris),\r\nConlon doesn\u2019t have much left to live for. He\u2019s the guy who wakes up in the bar\r\nthe next morning and just starts drinking again, forced to beg Shawn\u2019s son\r\nDanny (Boyd Holbrook) for money and drunkenly play Santa Claus at the Maguire\r\nChristmas party. The man who once was feared is now openly mocked by a younger,\r\ntougher generation of bad guys. Jimmy also lost all touch with his son Mike\r\n(Joel Kinnaman), who is trying to live a straight life as a limo driver with\r\nhis wife (Genesis Rodriguez) and two kids (with a third on the way).  The first act of \u201cRun All Night\u201d is really the arc of two\r\nsons\u2014one trying to get away from the criminal underworld and one diving as\r\ndeeply as possible into it. As Danny, the very talented Boyd Holbrook is all twitchy, nervous energy, the kind of dangerous sociopath who seems\r\ncapable of doing whatever it takes to gain the respect of his father through\r\ncriminal notoriety. To that end, he brings heroin into their world. Dad says\r\nno, but Albanian heroin dealers don\u2019t like to be pushed out of a possible\r\ncriminal enterprise. It just so happens that the dealers hire Mike to drive\r\nthem to a meeting with Danny that goes horribly awry. Before you know it, Danny\r\nis dead, and Mike is a target of everybody in the criminal underworld, including\r\na high-priced assassin played with effective cool by Common, and only his estranged\r\ndad can keep him safe till morning. Neeson does arguably the best work of his action career here\r\nin that he captures a man who doesn\u2019t just pop to life as a killing machine\r\nagain but has the muscle memory to get the job done one last time. Jimmy may\r\nstumble through subway tunnels but he can still choke a man out and fire a\r\nperfect shot when he needs to. And the actor rises above the potential clich\u00e9 of\r\nthe criminal redemption arc in the way he doesn\u2019t allow the potential melodrama\r\nto sink into his portrayal. His take on Jimmy is a man doing what needs to be\r\ndone, not necessarily to right the wrongs of the past but because there\u2019s\r\nnothing else he can do at this point. And watching Neeson and Harris in scenes\r\ntogether, especially a great, tense meeting in the middle of the piece, is a\r\nsurprising joy. They\u2019re both great here in that neither overplays the hero or\r\nvillain archetype. Jimmy, the good guy, is a murderer, while Shawn, the bad guy, is emotionally mourning the loss of his child. They are far more complex than they would have been in the hands of other\r\nactors. Advertisement \u201cRun All Night\u201d is also subtly elevated by a top-notch team\r\nbehind the camera, especially editor Craig McKay, a two-time Oscar nominee for \u201cReds\u201d\r\nand \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201d For at least an hour, \u201cRun All Night\u201d hums\u2014to be fair, there\u2019s\r\na bit of a sag in the middle and the entire piece runs too long at nearly two\r\nhours. But take note of the way McKay and Collet-Serra orchestrate a great sequence\r\nin a subway station, creating a rhythm between the cops trying to find Mike and\r\nthe bad guys coming after Jimmy. Or look at the great car chase scene, which is\r\nshot in a bit too much close-up (as are a few of the fights), but has a\r\nvisceral pace to it that makes it impossible to look away. Or watch one of the final sequences in a train yard and the way it perfectly fits together to build tension. There\u2019s a tempo to \u201cRun\r\nAll Night\u201d that really serves as the entertaining foundation of the whole film,\r\nand it\u2019s what so many boring action films lack. Some of \u201cRun All Night\u201d doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and I\r\nwished for a little more grit and a little less polish in some of its darker\r\nbeats (although viewers should be warned that this piece doesn\u2019t shy away from\r\nextreme violence at times). There\u2019s also a fine line between entertainment and\r\nbeing a bit too on-the-nose when you choose to set a shoot-out in an Irish bar\r\nto The Pogues, but the film had won me over by that point. And that\u2019s when you\r\nreally know an action film has worked overall\u2014when its flaws are beaten down\r\nlike the guys who choose to cross Jimmy Conlon by what works.", "Critic": "Beta"}
