{"Title": "The Riot Club", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Spoiled rich people have been awful for centuries and our\r\ntheatre, literature, and film has been reminding us of this fact with\r\nregularity. To this pile of moralizing fiction about the soulless elite, we can\r\nnow add Lone Scherfig\u2019s \u201cThe Riot Club,\u201d adapted from the play \u201cPosh\u201d by Laura\r\nWade by the author herself. The play caused something of a stir when it\r\npremiered in 2010, in no small part because it was deemed to be a commentary on\r\nthe actual Bullingdon Club, an all-male \u201cBriternity\u201d if you will, of men\r\nbehaving badly. The immediacy of real-time, horrendously escalating behavior on\r\na stage does not make the transition smoothly to film, partially because we\u2019ve\r\nseen stories like this so often before but also because of tonal and pacing\r\nmistakes made by Scherfig and a cast of overly similar young men who start to\r\nblur together. It\u2019s also a film with a muddled message in that it places these raucous,\r\nintellectual, smart people on a pedestal and then wags a finger at the audience\r\nfor ever liking 90% of them. It\u2019s a film that seems to have no further point\r\nthan to remind us that some powerful jerks were once powerful jerk kids. Point\r\ntaken, but it\u2019s not cinematically satisfying. Advertisement Max Irons (son of Jeremy) gets the most memorable role as\r\nMilo Richards, a first-year student at Oxford University who is quickly drawn\r\nto two people: Lauren (Holliday Grainger), a beautiful fellow first-year who\r\nforms a relationship with Milo despite her lower social status economically and\r\nformer Westminster schoolmate Hugo (Sam Reid), who proposes that Milo join an\r\nelite group to which he belongs: The Riot Club. The rules of The Riot Club are\r\nsimple. It must always have ten members. The ten members must come from\r\ncertain, elite schools like Westminster. And the ten members must drink\r\nheartily from the cup of life. In the prologue, in which we see the formation\r\nof The Riot Club, a toast is made that we shall \u201cEat till we are sick at the full table of life and never fade from\r\nglory.\u201d For a long first act, Scherfig and Wade depict this motto in\r\nvivid color. The initiation of Milo and fellow new member Alistair (Sam\r\nClaflin) plays like a hundred fraternity pledge weeks we\u2019ve seen in American\r\ncinema down to the vandalism of their rooms and the forcing them to ingest\r\nbodily fluids. They run around Oxford saying annoying things like \u201ctotally f**king legend\u201d and we wait for\r\nthe inevitable turn. Will these bad boys get their comeuppance and realize the\r\nerror of their ways? Milo is clearly set up as the only one with a conscience\r\nwhile Alistair is his opposite, a young man whose brother was a legendary Riot\r\nClub member and he has big, gross shoes to fill.  It all builds to the actual adaptation of the play, which\r\ncomes about 45 minutes in and takes place in a dinner club that the boys have\r\nrented for the night as a party to celebrate Milo and Alistair\u2019s induction.\r\nThey take over a back room, and one can tell that the seeds of resentment,\r\njealousy, and classism that Wade has planted are about to be watered. The\r\nintroductory act and this centerpiece of the film feel like different projects.\r\nThe characters, the class issues, the narrative purpose is more distinct.\r\nStill, the message of the film remains muddled even as vile words give way to\r\ndespicable actions. We are meant to like Milo basically because he has a\r\ngirlfriend and hesitates, only slightly, in the face of committing heinous\r\nactivity. It\u2019s a thinness of character that feels about as superficial as any\r\nof the Riot Club member\u2019s choices. And too much of the behavior, especially in\r\nthe first hour, is portrayed as glamourous. These are beautiful people doing\r\noutrageous things and the turn toward real darkness in the final act feels\r\nmanipulative more than organic. Advertisement To be fair, there are some strong performance here by the\r\ntwo gentlemen given real characters (Irons & Claflin\u2026the rest truly blur\r\ntogether, making one of their victims' assertions that he couldn\u2019t tell them\r\napart a bit of self-criticism on the film) and Grainger. And Scherfig gives a\r\nfew sequences the right degree of righteous indignation at the behavior of boys\r\nwho know they can pay their way out of any immorality. It\u2019s just not enough to\r\njustify the journey into the immorality that resides in the educational history\r\nof many of the world\u2019s power players. Yes, powerful young jerks become powerful adult jerks and there\u2019s little justice\r\nto it all. It's a tale as old as time, and the telling here isn't engaging enough to hear it again.", "Critic": "Beta"}
