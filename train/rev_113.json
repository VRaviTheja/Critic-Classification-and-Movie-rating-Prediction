{"Title": "The Hunting Ground", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Director Kirby Dick & Producer Amy Ziering follow up their award-winning \u201cThe\r\nInvisible War\u201d with another incendiary, shocking, infuriating masterpiece, \u201cThe\r\nHunting Ground.\u201d Again, they tackle an institution that has engendered a\r\nclimate in which sexual assault has nearly become normalized, an expectation on\r\ncertain college campuses. Over the next year, over 100,000 women will be\r\nsexually assaulted on college campuses. As disturbing as the actual crimes are,\r\nDick & Ziering point a righteous finger at the administrations that know\r\ntheir campuses live up to the title of this film for young women and yet they\r\ndo nothing in the pursuit of the almighty dollar. Our institutions of higher\r\nlearning are often sacrificing the safety of the children who go there in order\r\nto quash statistics that might hurt enrollment. It is an infuriating reality\r\nthat \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d exposes. I was rattled watching it, finding it hard\r\nto catch my breath and harder still to imagine how many people are in positions\r\nof power who have heard these stories so many times and turned their backs on\r\nvictims.  Advertisement It is a bit of a cruel joke that Dick & Ziering open\r\ntheir film with home videos of high school students reading their acceptance\r\nletters to the tune of \u201cPomp & Circumstance.\u201d And yet it\u2019s appropriate\r\nbecause it sets up a very vital theme in \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d\u2014that of the\r\nwide-eyed, optimistic teenager who really just wants to get an education but\r\nhas been sold a false bill of goods about their own safety. Lest you think any\r\nof this might be exaggerated for cinematic impact, the filmmakers pepper their\r\nentire film with jaw-dropping facts. 16-20% of undergraduates will be sexually\r\nassaulted. Even more won\u2019t report it for fear of falling into the category of a\r\nvictim or having to deal with an administration and society quick to blame the\r\nvictim. When one rape victim reports that the administrator to whom she\r\nreported the crime compared rape to a football game\u2014\u201cwhat would have done\r\ndifferently in the game?\u201d\u2014I literally wanted to start screaming. And that\u2019s\r\nwhat Dick & Ziering want. We should be screaming. The stats continue. In 2012, 40% of all colleges reported no\r\nsexual assaults. If there\u2019s anyone out there who actually believes that 2 out\r\nof 5 college campuses in this country actually had no sexual assaults that year, I\u2019m impressed you know how to use\r\nthe internet. What is actually happening is a very careful protection of the\r\nbrand name that is a college reputation. And it\u2019s happening everywhere. Even at\r\na place like Harvard, people are asking questions like \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you fight\r\nhim?\u201d At the University of Virginia, they had ZERO expulsions for sexual\r\nassault in the same time period that they had 183 for cheating and other\r\nacademic violations. Expelling cheaters looks better to check-cutting parents\r\nthan telling them that their child may not be safe. And this environment of denial\r\nallows for repeat offenders, who commit an average of SIX assaults. In some\r\ncases, they are literally given sanctuary in athletic facilities. Campus security\r\nat Notre Dame cannot contact athletes for any reason, even if a rape has been\r\nreported.  As a director, Dick knows how to build a case, intercutting\r\ninterviews with statistics that portray an epidemic, a crisis, a serious\r\nproblem for all Americans of all ages. Most importantly, they empower the\r\nvictims, giving them a platform from which to speak that the institutions that\r\nthey supported through attendance and tuition did not. And they focus most of\r\ntheir energy on two young women from North Carolina\u2014Andrea Pino and Annie E.\r\nClark\u2014who were raped on their campus and turned their stories into rallying\r\ncries for change across the country. Just as they did with Kori Cioca in \u201cThe\r\nInvisible War,\u201d the directors present true heroism in Pino and Clark, two\r\npeople who stood up for victim\u2019s rights and ended up revealing the depth of a problem\r\nthat I don\u2019t think even they knew was so widespread. \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d could\r\nhave been a series of disturbing statistics and personal stories, but the\r\ndirectors know that it is the survivors who are trying to enact change who will\r\ninspire viewers to support the action needed to make it so.  Advertisement The structure of \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d gets repetitive but\r\nthat\u2019s by design and Dick does an admirable job of subtly moving\r\nthrough different aspects of the issue from the lack of institutional response\r\nto the frat system to the athletic program, even spending a notable amount of\r\ntime on the Jameis Winston story and Florida State\u2019s disturbing response or\r\nlack thereof to the accusations against the soon-to-be NFL player. Whether or\r\nnot you believe Winston\u2019s accuser is not the issue\u2014although his fans and those\r\nof the program he led to glory will see it that way. No, the issue is that\r\nvictims are presumed to either be a contributing factor in the crime or\r\ndismissed altogether, especially when the accused is a superstar athlete. Until\r\nthat changes, until we value a victim\u2019s story of sexual assault above all else\u2014institutional\r\npride, tuition cost, legal complications, athletic prowess\u2014our children will\r\nnever be truly safe. And if our children aren\u2019t safe, how can you not be angry?", "Critic": "Beta"}
