{"Title": "The Founder", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cThe Founder\u201d is mesmerized by its hero, McDonald\u2019s chain founder Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), but horrified by how he built his empire. That kind of ambivalence is great; in fact it\u2019s a hallmark of good drama. But there are too many moments when \u201cThe Founder\u201d becomes a business-drama variant of that war film problem identified by Francois Truffaut: it\u2019s hard to make a truly anti-war film because war is inherently cinematic, and when you show it, people get swept up in the action anyway. The bloodshed in the business drama is (usually) figurative, but the conflict is still thrilling, and so a lot of films about business end up grappling with Truffaut's war movie problem. \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross,\u201d \u201cWall Street,\u201d \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d \u201cBoiler Room\u201d and the like are filled with the kinds of people you'd cross a room to avoid, yet you hear their lines quoted by businesspeople and b-school students as inspirational texts, probably because it's more fun to identify with the bastard who gets things done than the people who suffer from his actions. Ray Kroc is a local Chamber of Commerce version of Gordon Gekko. Keaton plays him with such laser-beam focus that even when the movie is appalled by Ray's shady maneuvers, it still leans on his every word.  Advertisement As written by Robert Siegel (\u201cThe Wrestler\u201d), directed by John Lee Hancock (\u201cThe Rookie\u201d) and acted by Keaton, Kroc at first seems a riff on \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d hero Willy Loman, or one of the real estate strivers in \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d who say they can't close deals because the leads are weak. We see him cold-calling restaurant owners and trying to sell them mixers out of the trunk of his car, then returning home to get pep talks from his wife Ethel (Laura Dern). By the end of the tale, he\u2019s become the Charles Foster Kane of hamburgers\u2014a bland megalomaniac surrounded by enablers and worshipers, ruling a corporation that he built by exploiting the optimism and trust of McDonald\u2019s originators Richard and Maurice McDonald (Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch), who were bought out at a too-low price and robbed of future royalties after accepting a handshake agreement that Kroc never honored.\u00a0 The film\u2019s depiction of the McDonald brothers is devastating, far and away the strongest thing in \u201cThe Founder.\u201d Every stop on their road to ruin is flagged and catalogued, from their decision to let Kroc expand into other states to their capitulation to production and profit-making ideas that they fear will turn the restaurant from a profitable but self-contained labor of love into a purveyor of unfrozen beef patties and powdered shakes. The movie does such a good job of showing the brothers\u2019 bond as a relationship founded on can-do spirit that when Kroc enters the picture, lavishing praise on their idea for a \u201cfast food\u201d restaurant with an assembly line service model, you can see why they\u2019d quit resisting his vision of a centralized franchise.\u00a0 Up until to the point where documents get signed and large sums start changing hands, the film treats Kroc as a sad sack chasing one last shot at redemption, so we\u2019re not surprised that the McDonald brothers would see that in him as well, and be moved to make his fairy tale (and theirs\u2014they failed to build their own chain) come true. (Offerman and Lynch, two of the best character actors alive, top themselves here; each has several close-ups so filled with betrayal and regret that even the film seems awed by their power.) Advertisement Siegel\u2019s script treats Kroc as the embodiment of a certain way of looking at American business values: smiley-faced positive, forever treating capitalism as a pure virtue that does so much good for society that its casualties are unimportant. On the road, Kroc repeats inspirational phrases he memorized from a self-help record. He believes in them as a cleric believes in a sacred text. His conversations with other characters are filled with formulations that you might hear from the mouth of a cult leader. They\u2019re bold and startling but also self-serving and cynical, as when he tells the brothers that he wants the McDonald\u2019s logo to be as ubiquitous as the American flag and the cross: \u201cThe new American church \u2026 Feeding bodies, feeding souls.\u201d\u00a0 And yet despite his blatant opportunism, Kroc sees himself as an idealist and myth-maker, not a huckster. He\u2019s not a knowingly evil person. But there\u2019s a void at his center\u2014which, \u201cThe Founder\u201d suggests, might be as much a requirement for legendary business success as the persistence that Kroc's self-help record keeps praising. (An especially deft screenwriting touch: Kroc, who claims the McDonalds\u2019 brothers\u2019 food service concepts as his own and ultimately steals their name, is shown repeating the \u201cpersistence\u201d speech in a business award speech without attribution.) Unfortunately, \u201cThe Founder\u201d often articulates its ideas in a tedious way, by having its characters deliver reams of exposition (some of it aided by documentary footage and old photos) in place of real conversations. The first third of the film is so thick with slide-show storytelling that it plays like a celebratory video that could be screened at a convention of McDonald\u2019s franchisees. The film also has such trouble integrating the business story with Kroc\u2019s tumultuous personal life\u2014he divorced Ethel for a younger woman named Joan (Linda Cardellini)\u2014that its women end up being defined by their level of support for Kroc\u2019s vision. The McDonald brothers are secondary characters, too, but they\u2019re fleshed out as individuals. You can picture their lives apart from (and before) Kroc. That\u2019s not the case with Ethel (a wet blanket, despite Dern's best efforts) or Joan (who likens Kroc to Alexander the Great not as a warning but as a compliment).   Advertisement Had \"The Founder\" focused solely on Kroc\u2019s relationship with the McDonald brothers, it might have been one of the great intimate, sour character studies of recent times. All the stuff with Kroc on the road acting like a beleaguered Jack Lemmon character and the scenes with his first wife nagging him and second-guessing him feel like attempts to will a three-dimensional, somewhat sympathetic biography into existence, even though the material resists it. The nagging suspicion that the filmmakers could not help but succumb to the charisma of Ray Kroc (or Michael Keaton?) lingers through the final stretch of \u201cThe Founder,\u201d which tries to visualize a hypnotic emotional void in the spirit of \u201cRaging Bull\u201d or \u201cThere Will Be Blood\" without laying the proper groundwork for it. (This film could have been titled \u201cThere Will Be Beef.\u201d) Still, I\u2019d be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t thought about \"The Founder\" constantly since seeing it. It's possible that a sharper, bleaker, more articulate film might not have resonated as strongly as this messy, self-canceling one. It's an ad that becomes a warning before circling around and becoming another, darker kind of advertisement, and one of the most intriguing and surprising things about \"The Founder\" is that, in the end, it seems vaguely ashamed of itself for letting this happen. Kroc steals the movie from Hancock and Siegel just like he stole McDonald's from the McDonald brothers. I guess you could say it stole my objections, too. I left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth. Then I went to McDonald\u2019s for the first time in over a year and ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese and a vanilla shake.", "Critic": "Delta"}
