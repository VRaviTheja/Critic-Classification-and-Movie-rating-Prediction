{"Title": "Hank and Asha", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Hank (Andrew Pastides) is handsome, outgoing, and romantic.\r\nAsha (Mahira Kakkar) is beautiful, sweet, and vulnerable. Who wouldn't want to watch them get together? James E. Duff\u2019s film\r\nabout these two immensely likable people starts with a found-footage conceit\r\nthat holds the potential to deconstruct what we know all too well about the\r\nromantic dramedy genre, giving viewers a unique take on a timeless tale. And\r\nyet as easy as it is to like Hank and Asha, it\u2019s impossible to look past the\r\nmany screenwriting and filmmaking flaws of the film about them. Advertisement \u201cHank and Asha\u201d consists of nothing but \u201cvideo letters\u201d from\r\nHank to Asha and Asha to Hank. Asha lives in Prague, where she sees a film by\r\nHank that she admires. She waits for the post-screening Q&A to meet the man behind the\r\nwork but he unexpectedly is forced to miss the meet & greet. And so Asha\r\ndoes something that might be slightly outside of her comfort zone: she sends\r\nsomeone she doesn\u2019t know a video introduction. Hank responds from his apartment\r\nin New York City. The two rather quickly (almost too much so to be realistic)\r\nopen up about their lives. Asha criticizes the lack of interior design in Hank\u2019s day-to-day, while Hank is often playful and silly, playing guitar or lip-syncing a dance\r\nroutine. The two form at least a supportive friendship, and possibly much more if they\r\nweren\u2019t separated by thousands of miles. Hank and Asha\u2019s relationship, which\r\nnever progresses to the Skype stage, goes through many of the ups and downs of\r\na physical one but would have been impossible just a technological generation\r\nago. The creative potential in the way that the physical\r\ndevelopment of technology has forever altered love,\r\npassion, and romance that Spike Jonze brilliantly mined in \"Her\" seems like the\r\nfoundation for a film built on video letters. Which is why the formulaic nature\r\nof Duff and Julia Morrison\u2019s script can be so frustrating. The structure of \u201cHank\r\nand Asha\u201d puts us right in the middle of what should be an intimate, personal,\r\norganic connection. Hank and Asha are speaking to each other but due to the\r\nnature of cinema, they are really speaking directly to the movie audience,\r\nconveying fears, concerns, and something at least approaching love. And yet\r\nDuff & Morrison waste the opportunity for true emotional connection on contrivance.  The first cinematic element that pushes \u201cHank and Asha\u201d closer\r\nto clich\u00e9 than reality is a matter of technical polish. Nothing here looks nearly\r\nDIY enough. Why is Asha opening a door\r\nto the already-on camera? Everything past the first few exchanges has the look\r\nof a VH1 music video. It\u2019s too well-framed, well-lit; yes, Hank is a filmmaker\r\nand Asha has an artist\u2019s eye, so I can give you that their videos may look\r\nbetter than average but why does she have a better editor than most Slamdance\r\nfilms? And when Duff and Morrison get to the \u201cpop stage\u201d, where they twice give\r\neach character a \u201cCoffee House\u201d track to adorn their montages, we\u2019ve reached\r\nthe point where it feels more like watching a Plain White T\u2019s music video than\r\nanything else.  Advertisement The script starts to reflect (or perhaps influence) the film\u2019s\r\noverly polished manner. Why do they so often respond via video message as if\r\nthey\u2019re talking to each other in conversation when we know they\u2019re not? She\r\nreveals something and Hank \u201cresponds\u201d with \u201cWhoa. Wow. That\u2019s huge.\u201d as if he\r\nhasn\u2019t had hours to think about it before preparing his response. Why not\r\nembrace the idea that modern technology would alter the romantic conversation\r\ninstead of pretending that we\u2019re in the middle of a dinner date? Use the form to put the viewer in a position that doesn't so often feel like a standard third wheel. \u201cHank and Asha\u201d\r\ntries to replicate the dating process through modern technology but fails to\r\ncomment on how said technology really changes their behavior (or even just to make the\r\ncase that it doesn\u2019t). Found footage has been a subgenre often reserved for horror\r\nfilms and yet the worst of them often fall into the same genre traps as their\r\non-film counterparts. The same fate befalls \u201cHank and Asha,\u201d a film with two\r\ngenuinely likable characters and performers that can\u2019t avoid the clich\u00e9s of the\r\ngenre it could have so easily deconstructed.", "Critic": "Beta"}
