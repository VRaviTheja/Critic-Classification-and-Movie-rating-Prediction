{"Title": "Compadres", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "If you\u2019re a fan of Mexican film and television star Omar\r\nChaparro, I\u2019ve got some good news and some bad news. The good is that Chaparro is\r\nstarring in his first crossover-to-Hollywood picture. The bad is that I bet it\r\nisn\u2019t the crossover-to-Hollywood picture he was hoping for. The compact Chaparro\u2014he could be a blockier cousin to Antonio\r\nBanderas by way of George Clooney\u2014is here saddled to an unlikely-buddy-cop\r\nmovie. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of those. His foil is a fat teenage computer hacker\r\nin L.A. who\u2019s gotten himself in inadvertent trouble with some very nasty drug\r\ntraffickers. He's played by Joey Morgan, which is maybe good news for fans of\r\n\u201cScouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse,\u201d in which Morgan played \u2026 yes, the fat\r\none.  Advertisement This movie, which is what you\u2019d call a god-awful mess,\r\ndoesn\u2019t even introduce Morgan\u2019s character until about a half an hour in. That\u2019s\r\nhow conscientiously structured it is. Instead, it begins with Chaparro\u2019s\r\ncharacter, Garza, in a kitchen playing with an adorable toddler and making\r\nsmall talk with the toddler\u2019s mother, his partner\u2019s wife. She tells him he\r\nreally ought to settle down, family is everything, etc. Whereupon Garza takes\r\nsaid partner out on a drug bust and, well take a wild guess. With the partner\r\ndead, the wife and daughter are never seen again. Garza\u2019s taken out for a drink\r\nby his commanding officer, who chides him very mildly for not waiting for\r\nbackup. Garza eyes the fetching barmaid, and starts seeing her in slow motion.\r\nNot since David \u201cAl\u201d Hedison cheerfully invited Timothy Dalton to go fishing\r\nmere days after his character, Felix Leiter, watched his own wife get eaten by\r\na shark (which also chomped off his own leg) in \u201cLicense To Kill\u201d has a movie\r\ncharacter shucked off tragedy so casually. But wait. There\u2019s a \u2026 well I wouldn\u2019t\r\nsay method to the plot beats\r\nconcocted by director/co-writer Enrique Begne and co-writers Ted Perkins and\r\nGabriel Ripstein (staggeringly, the son of Mexican cinema giant Arturo\r\nRipstein).  The barmaid and Garza end up together, in a family way,\r\nand then she\u2019s kidnapped by the same drug dealers who got his partner, and the\r\nU.S. feds get involved (Eric Roberts plays the head honcho). It's a big mess. It\u2019s an even bigger mess because the movie is so haphazardly edited. One\r\nunderstands the effect that Begne\u2019s aiming for\u2014flashing forward and backward in\r\nshort order during certain scenes to highlight bits of information that are\r\nmeant to pay off in \u201caha!\u201ds for the\r\nviewer\u2014but the execution is staggeringly shoddy and stumbling. The ostensible\r\nhumor\u2014diarrhea jokes, amputated-finger-of-a-corpse jokes, burning-people-alive\r\njokes\u2014competes with plot complications thrown about willy-nilly. To make\r\nmatters worse, the movie looks like it was color-corrected with the \u201cHot\r\nPink\u201d dial turned all the way up for the whole time. I know. There isn\u2019t really\r\na \u201cHot Pink\u201d dial on a color-correcting console. But you know what I\u2019m saying.  Eventually, the movie works up a weird fascination. At one\r\npoint the viewer may be moved to ask, silently, of Chaparro\u2019s Garza, \u201cYes, sure,\r\nyou left the pistol with which Kevin Pollak was trying to kill himself in the\r\ntrash can of the men\u2019s room of this diner. But now that the eccentric bad guys\r\nhave shown up, don\u2019t you still have that huge Magnum you stole off of the Irish\r\nconvenience store clerk with whom you had a fist fight 25 minutes ago?\u201d And so\r\non. (The answer was, \u201cYes, but he must have forgotten, as he pulls it out in a\r\nlater scene.\u201d) As the movie resolves in a truly, um, unusual plot twist, I\r\nguess I\u2019m glad I stayed to the end. Well, actually, no. I only stayed to the end\r\nout of professional obligation. In another set of circumstances I could have\r\nnot learned of the plot twist and had a perfectly fine remainder of my life.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
