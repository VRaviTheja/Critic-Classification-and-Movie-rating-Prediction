{"Title": "Big Stone Gap", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cWhen I was a girl and we drove past the coal mines it seemed like a storybook to me,\u201d the lead character of \u201cBig Stone Gap,\u201d rather amusingly named Ave Maria Mulligan, says at the beginning of this movie, written and directed by Adriana Trigiani and based on her popular novel of the same name. The movie\u2019s title is also the name of the small town in Virginia it depicts and was apparently shot in. \u201cLife was simple\u201d there, Ave Maria tells us, and we can believe it.\u00a0 \n Ave Maria, played by Ashley Judd, relates to the viewer that in 1978, the year she turned 40, she was the official town spinster of Big Stone Gap. Although for the first twenty minutes or so, one gets the impression she doesn\u2019t seem to mind much. She\u2019s the director of the town\u2019s annual theatrical production of \u201cThe Trail Of The Lonesome Pine\u201d and rehearsals are going well and the show is close to selling out. She is capable of flirting productively with the town\u2019s best looking eligible bachelor Jack (Patrick Wilson) and has solid friendships with other fellows in the town, including theater cohort Theodore (John Benjamin Hickey). She has nifty female pals played by Whoopi Goldberg and Jenna Elfman. She\u2019s friend to the local outcast young woman Pearl. She lives in a big old house with her wonderful, Italian-accented mom.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Who, alas, dies in the aforementioned first twenty minutes. \u201cNo one worries about you like your mother,\u201d Ave Maria says in voiceover. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn to her anymore and it changes your life forever.\u201d Ain\u2019t it the truth. Also changing Ave Maria\u2019s life: the revelation of a family secret, the threats of a nasty quasi-in-law, and the prospect of Jack\u2019s marriage to a local hotsy-totsy who\u2019s such a hotsy-totsy that she actually goes by the name \u201cSweet Sue\u201d (Jane Krakowski). And turning the whole town\u2019s head is the prospect of a visit from a senatorial candidate named John Warner and his movie star wife Elizabeth Taylor. (And yes, this event is a historical fact, and a somewhat notorious one, as the movie shows, or as you can find out via a computer search engine).\u00a0 \n The movie ambles along amiably enough for a while; it\u2019s better if you are a fan of one or more members of the cast. Judd brings her \u201cWhere The Heart Is\u201d/\u201dA Time To Kill\u201d A-game to the proceedings, Goldberg doesn\u2019t overdo her friendly comedy relief, Elfman is bubbly, Krakowski dry, Wilson handsome. Jasmine Guy turns up, looking rather remarkably like Ruby Dee. The movie puts its foot in a big pile of goofy when the character of \u201cElizabeth Taylor\u201d makes herself known as a bouffy wig on actress Dagmara Dominczyk, always shot from behind. This coincides with a ramping up of the movie\u2019s romantic comedy content, and if you are not on board by this time, you might find yourself nodding in vigorous, non-ironic agreement with Goldberg\u2019s character at the point when she observes, \u201cThis is the dumbest wedding I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}
