{"Title": "From the Land of the Moon", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "It may have been earlier for you\u2014I can be skeptical to a very definite fault\u2014but for me, 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Immigrant\u201d was the moment I finally accepted Marion Cotillard as an acting force of nature. Not that I had disliked the French performer prior to that. I always enjoyed seeing her turn up, even in otherwise ghastly films (remember her in Ridley Scott\u2019s mortifying attempt at light comedy, \u201cA Good Year\u201d?). But it was with \u201cThe Immigrant\u201d that I had that moment of transition from \u201cShe\u2019s very good\u201d to \u201cshe\u2019s incredible,\u201d and that impression held, of course, through 2014\u2019s \u201cTwo Days, One Night,\u201d her collaboration with the Belgian filmmaking brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne. For \u201cAnchorman 2,\u201d maybe not so much. But you get the idea.  Advertisement Cotillard is the anchor of \u201cFrom The Land of the Moon,\u201d directed by Nicole Garcia from a script that Garcia, Jacques Fieschi, and Natalie Carter adapted from a novel by Milena Agus. She plays Gabrielle, a woman of post-WWII rural France who\u2019s a fool for love. The picture begins by framing a flashback. Gabrielle and her husband Jose are driving to Lyon, taking their young son to participate in a piano competition. She sees a street sign, demands the car stop, and runs out. Her husband placidly drives on, which is odd. Gabrielle finds a house, and an apartment belonging to one Monsieur Sauvage, which sounds like a pretty potentially on-the-nose name. She contemplates ringing the bell \u2026 and the flashback begins. Gabrielle is in late schooldays, mooning over a teacher who gives her a copy of Wuthering Heights\u00a0and practically propositioning him days later. Willful Gabrielle seems, later, to be shaping her life according to the parameters limned by a Bronte sister, or perhaps by Flaubert. She is bedeviled by physical pain, and her mother tells a doctor she\u2019s not sure whether her daughter isn\u2019t faking them. Frustrated by Gabrielle\u2019s behavior, the mother offers to marry her off to a local Spanish laborer. Jose\u2019s pride is affronted, but not too terribly. The feisty Gabrielle immediately informs him that she\u2019ll never love him.  So, it\u2019s not an immediately blessed marriage, but Jose manages to keep his frustrations tamped down, at least for much of the time. This is because he\u2019s a decent sort, but also because Gabrielle\u2019s not faking her physical pain. Diagnosed with what we now call plain old kidney stones (the movie\u2019s French title, \u201cMal de pierres\u201d translates to \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d \u201cstones\u201d), she seeks a \u201ccure\u201d at a mountain spa that specializes in water treatments.  Away from domestic life, she luxuriates in the crisp air. Soon she spies Lieutenant Sauvage, played by Louis Garrel, a young French male star with what Bullwinkle Moose used to call \u201cthe ultry-sultry look.\u201d Pale and quiet, missing a leg from his stint in the war in Indochina, Garrel\u2019s character seems too delicate to live. And so Gabrielle and he are drawn into a very fraught affair. It is this Lieutenant whom the now more steadily domesticated Gabrielle seeks out years later. But not before a reluctant return home, the birth of a child (which she believes to be not Jose\u2019s), and a meaningful chat with her younger sister, who mentions she\u2019d like a divorce. \u201cWe don\u2019t divorce in this family,\u201d Gabrielle tells her sister. The sister responds, \u201cYou\u2019ve not been unhappy with Jose?\u201d Gabrielle allows that she has not. This seems rather improbable. \u201cFrom the Land of the Moon\u201d is a melodrama with an interesting trick in its tail, but I don\u2019t think that director Garcia pulls the trick off as well as she might have. The movie is sumptuously shot by Christophe Beaucarne; every frame is robustly picturesque. But the story could have used a little less \u201cUnder the Tuscan Sun\u201d and a little more \u201cAll That Heaven Allows.\u201d Not that I mean to be cryptic about it, but I don\u2019t want to give the whole thing away either. In any event, even if the execution lacks in other areas, Cotillard has a field day with the role of Gabrielle, committing to her needy passion without batting an eye, even when it\u2019s manifesting itself in the most mortifying ways. It\u2019s a protean performance.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
