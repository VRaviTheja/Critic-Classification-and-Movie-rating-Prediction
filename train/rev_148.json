{"Title": "On Any Sunday, The Next Chapter", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "You might have heard of the 1971 doc \u201cOn Any Sunday,\u201d\r\nproduced by avid motorcycle guy Steve McQueen and directed by Bruce Brown,\r\nwho\u2019d made his name prior to it with groundbreaking movies about surfing,\r\nparticularly 1964\u2019s \u201cThe Endless Summer.\u201d But did you know that \u201cSunday\u201d was\r\nkind of the start of a franchise? \u201cOn Any Sunday 2\u201d followed in 1981. In 2000,\r\nBruce Brown\u2019s son Dana, who has also made his own surfing movie, 2003\u2019s \u201cStep\r\nInto Liquid\u201d (Dana\u2019s also behind some \u201cSummer\u201d sequels, but let\u2019s not get too\r\nconfusing), made \u201cOn Any Sunday Revisited,\u201d followed by a making-of on the\r\nfirst picture, \u201cOn Any Sunday: Motocross, Malcolm and More,\u201d and now Dana\r\npresents \u201cThe Next Chapter.\u201d  Advertisement My recollection of the first \u201cOn Any Sunday\u201d movie is less\r\nof the movie itself than of an impression of the audience that embraced it:\r\nworkaday American men who looked at biking as a form of unalienated leisure, an\r\nexhilarating escape. A measure of how the world has changed is given the viewer\r\nin this movie\u2019s opening presentation logos: a welder works on a bike in a\r\nsparkling garage, while a little girl cavorts about; the logo \u201cRed Bull Media\r\nHouse\u201d manifests itself in 3D, followed by the logo of Freeride Entertainment;\r\nwe\u2019re then informed, in this garage, that what follows is \u201cSupported By\r\nSkullcandy.\u201d (Later in the movie, a motorcyclist executes a stunt from a Park\r\nCity, Utah, ski jump, and vaults over another Skullcandy logo.) The machines of\r\nescape are now lifestyle appurtenances.  What follows is all handsomely shot and not without some\r\ngeneral interest\u2014but the movie\u2019s only really going to play for you if motorcycles\r\nand those who ride them are subjects to which you\u2019re somewhat sympathetic. Dana\r\nBrown himself supplies the narration, and it\u2019s a welter of sub-MTV style\r\nadvertisements for itself; this is a story, Brown announces, \u201cthat defies\r\nstereotypes,\u201d which usually means that it rearranges a particular set of\r\nstereotypes to make it seem as if it\u2019s defying stereotypes. I mean, don\u2019t get\r\nme wrong, the stuff about the deaf female motorcyclist Ashley Fiolek is\r\ninteresting and somewhat touching, but to this viewer it would have been even\r\nmore so had I not been assured about how surprised I was going to be right at\r\nthe outset. The classic rock soundtrack choices don\u2019t exactly \u201cdefy\u201d anything\r\nthemselves, either.  Forgive me: what I really wanted this film to explain are\r\nthe (excuse my French) a-holes you find in some urban areas who think it\u2019s\r\nacceptable to rev their machines at ear-splitting volume at stop lights for no\r\ngood reason. What\u2019s their story? Do they have any kind of rationale that makes\r\nany kind of sense aside from the conclusion I\u2019ve already made about such\r\ncharacters? Brown declines to venture into this area. In other respects,\r\nhowever, he delivers a clean and concise report on The Wide World Of\r\nMotorcycling in the 21st Century, and also delivers some memorable\r\nimagery, particularly at the Bonneville Salt Flats and in Southeast Asia.
