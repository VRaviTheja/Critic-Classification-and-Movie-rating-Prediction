{"Title": "The Mind of Mark DeFriest", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cMark reacts.\u201d\r\nThose two words may be the best way to describe Mark Defriest, one of the most\r\ninfamous prisoners in the Florida penal system. He\u2019s a man who doesn\u2019t sit\r\nstill, even if his reactions lead to more harm than good. His story, chronicled\r\nin \u201cThe Mind of Mark Defriest\u201d is an infuriating one in that you want to shake\r\neveryone involved and ask them what the purpose of incarceration really is in\r\ntoday\u2019s society. Mark Defriest is not a dangerous man to society. He\u2019s clearly mentally\r\nill. And yet, after being sentenced to a ridiculously high four years for\r\nstealing tools that he obviously thought belonged to him after the death of his\r\nfather and before the will could be processed, Defriest has now spent 34 years\r\nbehind bars, and, at the time of the initial documentary filming, was scheduled\r\nfor parole in 2085. A series of prison escapes and serious DRs (Disciplinary\r\nReports) kept pushing his release date well past the norm, and his behavior behind\r\nbars has put him in solitary confinement for 27 of the last 34 years. Mark\r\nreacts, and the prison system reacts back. Advertisement Directed by Gabriel London, most of \u201cThe Mind of Mark\r\nDefriest\u201d consists, naturally, of Mark telling his ridiculous story, sometimes\r\nin his own words and sometimes through animated reenactments with the voices of\r\nScoot McNairy as Mark and Shea Wigham as other characters. Defriest was first\r\njailed in 1979 after the death of his father. He went to pick up some tools\r\nthat he thought belonged to him, and his mother accused him of stealing them.\r\nThe 19-year-old was given four years for the theft, but with good behavior\r\nwould likely have been out much sooner. Mark couldn\u2019t be contained behind bars.\r\nHe would craft prison items into weapons, including guns, and escaped more than\r\nonce, being re-captured every time and adding more years to his sentence.  The first act of \u201cThe Mind of Mark Defriest,\u201d in which many\r\nof Mark\u2019s more remarkable behind-bars behaviors are chronicled, is a little too\r\nhaphazard for its own good. As fun as McNairy\u2019s line readings can be, I wanted\r\nless animated memories. Defriest is a fascinating subject in his own right,\r\nand, from the very beginning, the film works best in the moments when it lets\r\nhim talk instead of its flashy, sensationalistic ones. Director Gabriel London\r\ndidn\u2019t need to skew every angle and quick cut every interview. There\u2019s so much\r\nstory here, let it tell itself instead of weighing it down in movie effects. Surprisingly and refreshingly, that\u2019s kind of what London\r\ndoes about halfway through as the animated memories let up and we spend way\r\nmore time with Defriest and the people trying to get him out of jail, including\r\nthe medical professional who once declared him \u201cmalingering\u201d (faking mental\r\nillness to get out of sentencing) but now firmly believes that Mark has serious\r\ncompetency issues. Is Mark mentally ill or is it one of his tactics? He does\r\nthings that are clearly harmful to\r\nhim and his legal situation. Isn\u2019t that a kind of mental illness in itself? As\r\nthe doctor says, \u201cPeople can be planful\r\nin the service of strange ideas.\u201d Just because Mark has the wherewithal to\r\nplan and scheme doesn\u2019t make him mentally competent. Advertisement It\u2019s also remarkably smart of London to get the warden of\r\nthe Florida State Prison involved to corroborate Mark\u2019s reports of the terrifying\r\nconditions behind bars. At different times in his incarceration, Mark was\r\ngang-raped, kept as a \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d and forced into a solitary condition in\r\nwhich he had no lights, running water, utensils, or clothes. It\u2019s hard to believe\r\nthat this is happening in the United States, and one hopes \u201cThe Mind of Mark\r\nDefriest\u201d forces further investigation into sanctioned torture happening in our\r\npenal system. \u201cThe Mind of Mark Defriest\u201d is the rare documentary that\r\ngets more and more interesting as it goes along, even ending with an update on\r\nthis still-unfolding story that just took place. As Mark\u2019s story gets less headline-grabbing\r\n(prison escapes! makeshift guns!), London allows the movie to really focus on\r\nits subject in all its fascinating complexities. How can a man known as the\r\nPrison Houdini do so many things that sabotage his own life? And is the only\r\nresponse our system can muster up for someone like Mark Defriest further\r\npunishment? Just because \u201cMark reacts,\u201d doesn\u2019t mean our legal or mental health\r\nsystems need to do the same.", "Critic": "Beta"}
