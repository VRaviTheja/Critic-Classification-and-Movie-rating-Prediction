{"Title": "It's So Easy and Other Lies", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\u201cIt\u2019s So Easy and Other Lies\u201d is a TV special (or DVD extra) about Duff McKagan\u2019s live reading of his book of the same name, as accompanied by a band. It\u2019s not revealing or dense enough to really qualify as a feature doc, as evidenced by its remarkably brief running time and superficial retelling of complex chapters from McKagan\u2019s life. To call it a greatest hits version of the book wouldn\u2019t even really be accurate as the film can\u2019t stay focused on any chapter or anecdote long enough for them to resonate. And the movie has an undeniable black hole at its center in the fact that it barely mentions Axl Rose, and includes no original Guns N' Roses recordings (although the band does play instrumental versions of songs like \"Paradise City\" and \"Nighttrain\"). McKagan reads passages from his book and performs songs in front of an audience, and that serves as the foundation of \u201cIt\u2019s So Easy and Other Lies.\u201d I would have much rather just watched a concert film of that event than the documentary that Christopher Duddy tries to shape from it. Advertisement Of course, \u201cIt\u2019s So Easy and Other Lies\u201d opens with the word \u201cfuck\u201d and some guitar riffs. It kind of legally has to, right? As the personable and incredibly talented McKagan reads chapters from his book, Duddy intercuts them with old photos, footage of Duff riding around L.A., interviews and even animation. It\u2019s a cluttered approach that feels desperate to please and almost manic. For the next seventy minutes or so, this style rarely changes, as the film flits from subject to subject. We learn about when Duff met Slash. We hear about McKagan\u2019s early bands (some with names like Thankless Dogs, Cleavage and The Fartz). We get a bit about how Seattle drug culture was killing some of the biggest names in music. Although any music fan who sees \u201cAndrew Wood RIP\u201d followed by \u201cLayne Staley RIP\u201d and then hears the line from McKagan\u2019s book \u201cand the grunge thing didn\u2019t happen until like ten years later\u201d will know how haphazardly the film has been edited together (Wood died in \u201990, Staley in \u201902, grunge \u201chappened\u201d in between). It may sound like nitpicking but it\u2019s an example of how unfocused the movie can feel. There are also elements of McKagan\u2019s writing that are easily forgivable as we speed through the book but less so when read aloud. Lines like \u201cThe whole world is vibrating with anger from within \u2026 and, more ominously, from without\u201d don\u2019t do the production any favors. Most frustratingly, Duddy and McKagan SPEED through the Guns N' Roses years, probably because they knew its degree of difficulty without the actual music. About Axl Rose, we hear McKagan say \u201cI liked him right away,\u201d and then praise his voice, and that\u2019s about it. McKagan talks about hearing Axl scream for the first time, and we don\u2019t hear it. It made me want to pause the movie and go listen to Appetite for Destruction again (and I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t do that). The long history of the drama of GNR is well-recorded, but you can\u2019t really tell McKagan\u2019s story and treat it like a footnote. When someone says late in the film, \u201cWe could talk about McKagan a lot and not talk about Guns N' Roses,\u201d he\u2019s not quite right. And when the film focuses more on Velvet Revolver than GNR, it\u2019s impossible not to feel like the balance is off. 41 minutes into the film, McKagan starts actually singing\u2014\u201cKnockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door,\u201d one of two songs GNR recorded that they were allowed to use, and the other is also a cover, proving that original lyrics were clearly a no-no\u2014during a particularly rough flashback about when his pancreas exploded during a time when he was so deep in his addiction that he barely noticed at first. I would have watched a lot more of that. I imagine the live show, interspersing the readings and live music, is more powerful by having both. By reducing it to just a few lines from the book and editing in everything else, all of it is diminished: the music, the book, the true story. And when the movie essentially ends 30 minutes later (it\u2019s filled out to a more reasonable film running time with an actual musical performance\u2014\u201cYou Can\u2019t Put Your Arms Around a Memory,\u201d a New York Dolls cover that GNR did on \u201cThe Spaghetti Incident\u201d), we\u2019re left wondering what we\u2019ve learned. Duff McKagan is talented, smart and nice. He went through some deep shit with his addictions and came out stronger and happier, with a beautiful family. And he was in one of the best bands of all time. His story deserves a better movie. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
