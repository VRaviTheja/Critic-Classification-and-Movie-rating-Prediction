{"Title": "Every Thing Will Be Fine", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The opening and closing sequences of \"Every Thing Will Be Fine,\" the first\r\nfiction feature from German director Wim Wenders in almost a decade, are among\r\nthe most masterful he\u2019s created, and over the course of his long career he\u2019s\r\ncreated quite a few such scenes \u2026 and, more to the point, quite a few such whole\r\nfilms. But bear with me.  The opening sequence sees young writer Tomas (James Franco)\r\nseeking space to create in a fisherman\u2019s hut on a frozen lake. Dispirited,\r\nunproductive, he tools around on land a bit, having intermittent tetchy phone\r\nconversations with his girlfriend Sara (Rachel McAdams). Driving in a snowstorm,\r\nhe\u2019s distracted, and has an automobile mishap. He\u2019s relieved to find a\r\ncompletely intact, but very shaken up child propped right next to his front\r\nbumper, and walks the boy to the remote farm house up the hill, from which he\r\nwas no doubt darting out with his plastic sled. Once they get to the house, the\r\nother shoe drops when they meet the boy\u2019s mother, Kate (Charlotte Gainsbourg).\r\nThere\u2019s almost no dialogue, only a calm command of cinema language, conjuring\r\nsuspense, dread and poignancy, enhanced by Wenders\u2019 expressive use of 3D, a format he also used for his spectacular 2011 dance documentary \u201cPina.\u201d  Advertisement So far so good, at least as far as the movie is concerned.\r\nNot so much for Tomas, who\u2019s traumatized by the accident to the extent that he\r\nchecks out on life big time, ending in a hospital bed after what Sara\r\nrecognizes as a half-hearted suicide attempt. So, yes: this is a movie in which\r\nJames Franco plays a white, male, mostly-self-tortured artist, coping with a\r\nmajor spiritual crisis. What could be worse?  In theory, I agree with you. And in practice, \u201cEvery Thing\r\nWill Be Fine\u201d wears a certain preciosity on its sleeve, starting with the\r\ntitle, with its deliberately broken \u201cEverything,\u201d oy. One might suspect The New\r\nSincerity in action, except that Wenders has always been a one-hundred percent\r\nsincere filmmaker, whether creating such acute stories of existential anxiety\r\nas \u201cThe American Friend,\u201d luminous, mysticism-laden parables of love like\r\n\u201cWings of Desire,\u201d or atrociously soft-headed meditations on being a man out of\r\ntime, as in his dire 2008 \u201cPalermo Shooting,\u201d his most recent fiction feature\r\nand not a particularly good omen for this one. \u201cEvery Thing Will Be Fine\u201d is in a very real sense\r\nthematically quaint, and too often the screenplay, by Bj\u00f8rn Olaf Johannessen, is\r\nspectacularly verbally maladroit, not to mention vague. \u201cNeither of us is fine \u2026 we want different\r\nthings in life \u2026 I just want to write \u2026\u00a0\u201d is the sort of thing the performers have\r\nto work with for the first half of the movie. As irritating as the commonplaces\r\nare, and as distractingly bad as the dialogue gets, glints and glimmers of\r\nperception and feeling find their way out from the 3D frame. Gainsbourg\u2019s\r\nsingle mom character, an illustrator, has a quiet, enigmatic dignity, and the\r\nscenes at the center of the film between her and Franco seem to want to take\r\nthe narrative in a more expansive direction, away from the commonplace\r\nsolipsism of Tomas\u2019 character, who by this point has moved on from Sara and\r\ninto a relationship with Maria Jos\u00e9e Croze\u2019s Ann, herself the mother of a young\r\ngirl. The narrative, as it happens, moves across a span of twelve years, and\r\ndoes go to some disturbing and unexpected places. Tomas\u2019 encounter with Sara\r\nmany years after the fact is satisfying in a way the filmmakers perhaps did not\r\nintend, but I can\u2019t be too confident about that.  And Franco actually does mostly alright by his possibly\r\nimpossible character. His inspired work in \u201cSpring Breakers\u201d notwithstanding,\r\nhe\u2019s been frittering away his credibility as a dramatic actor for some time, but given the lack of detail he\u2019s got to work with here, he\u2019s not a presence\r\nyou want to eye-roll off the screen. Although the point in the film at which\r\nhis performance needs to gather strength\u2014a tense kitchen-table confrontation\r\nwith another male near the end\u2014is exactly the point where he trots out his\r\nstoner squint-and-smirk; not really the right choice. Elsewhere he\u2019s\r\nfine, and particularly fine when his character is called upon to examine his\r\nown lack of affect.  Advertisement \u201cEvery Thing Will Be Fine\u201d is far from a perfect film. But\r\nWenders is trying to do new things within the confines of a pretty standard\r\nEuropean art-film scenario, and the viewer can see he\u2019s not approaching the\r\nmaterial as though it\u2019s rote; he\u2019s really trying to use the camera to get\r\nthrough the feelings of loss the characters suffer. Wenders is also the author\r\nof a book of essays called \u201cEmotion Pictures,\u201d and he once again brings some\r\nhonor to that concept with this flawed but intriguing work.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
