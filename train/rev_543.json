{"Title": "Day of the Dead: Bloodline", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "I was at Montreal\u2019s wonderful genre festival, Fantasia, last year when I heard that George A. Romero had passed away and I honestly felt my knees a buckle a little bit. Very few filmmakers have influenced me as greatly as the king of the zombies, the man who redefined horror in a way that\u2019s still resonating today. I\u2019m kind of a zombie movie nut, willing to watch even the most negligible title (although, somewhat tellingly, I mostly gave up on the tedium of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d a few years ago). And so when \u201cDay of the Dead: Bloodline,\u201d a promised retelling of one of Romero\u2019s classic \u201cDead\u201d films came across my radar, I thought, \u201cThat might be a fun way to start the new year.\u201d It\u2019s not. Advertisement \u201cDay of the Dead: Bloodline\u201d feels like one of those zombie flicks that was slightly tweaked here and there to resemble the 1985 Romero film but could have started life as any sort of flick featuring brain-eaters. The shared DNA with Romero\u2019s flick is in two key aspects of this new work\u2014the setting of a remote military-run complex after the world has been overrun by the undead and a 'Bub' character who seems a little different than your run-of-the-mill zombie. However, the social commentary that coursed underneath \u201cDay of the Dead\u201d is largely lacking here. While Romero\u2019s film felt like it had something to say about control and the government (even if Roger notoriously didn\u2019t think it succeeded in saying it), \u201cBloodline\u201d can\u2019t figure out its message, and the characters are nowhere near interesting enough to overcome the muddled themes of the film.    \u201cBloodline\u201d sets its tone with a hyperactive opening scene that attempts to capture the end of the world. A woman, who we will learn is a medical professional named Zoe (Sophie Skelton), shuffles her way down a street as the zombie apocalypse unfolds around her. Instantly, it\u2019s clear that these are more \u201cBoyle Zombies,\u201d the runners from the \u201c28 Days Later\u201d films than the plodders from Romero\u2019s works. They even have the hand-eye coordination to snatch people off moving bicycles and crash car windows. The world has gone mad.    Cut to \u201cFour Hours Earlier,\u201d where we learn more about Zoe, who is working at a hospital when hell breaks loose. The flashback is mostly designed to introduce us to Max (Jonathan Schaech), a creepy patient of Zoe\u2019s who not only has something unique about his blood but is obsessed with our heroine. How obsessed? Carved-her-name-in-his-arm obsessed. During a party at the facility, Max tries to rape Zoe, only to have a corpse the doctors were examining spring to life and attack him. Suddenly, the office party is going very badly. At least one can say that \u201cDay of the Dead: Bloodline\u201d wastes no time getting to spurting jugulars, consumed intestines, and puking blood.    Advertisement Cut to five years later, as Zoe is a doctor at a refugee camp, where she works on \u2018rotters\u2019 and takes care of the humans who live there, including a high military presence. Of course, she has to go out to find meds for a sick kid, which leads her convoy back to the hospital from the opening scenes. Guess who\u2019s still there? Before you know it, zombie Max has returned to the camp with Zoe and the midsection of \u201cBloodline\u201d plays out like a weird riff on slasher pics. It\u2019s like \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d with Jason replaced by a zombie and Camp Crystal Lake a refugee camp. There are even slasher pic set-ups like \u201cHey, go check on the maintenance guy who didn\u2019t show up to do his job,\u201d and Max acts like a serial killer in the way he stalks his prey. It\u2019s not long before Zoe realizes that Max is valuable\u2014her sociopath rapist could be their savior. Ewww.\u00a0 There are a few well-choreographed action scenes and the makeup work here is actually pretty strong, especially on Max, who seems like a character whose design was influenced by Tom Savini\u2019s breakthrough accomplishments in the first \u201cDay,\u201d and not just in the way he kind of becomes this movie\u2019s \u2018Bub.\u2019 The biggest problem with \u201cBloodline\u201d is that Zoe is just a dull character, both on the page and as performed. So it\u2019s a film that\u2019s ostensibly about objectifying and possessing women that features a personality-less object as the protagonist, thereby creating a black hole at the center of the film. By the time the movie reaches its noisy climax, I think I felt like Roger did about the original movie\u2014that I was just watching people I didn\u2019t care about yell at each other and make really stupid decisions. If you agree with his review, this is actually a pretty loyal remake.", "Critic": "Beta"}
