{"Title": "Cannibal", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The opening scenes of Manual Mart\u00edn Cuenca\u2019s \u201cCannibal\u201d are\r\nstrikingly effective. The credits roll slowly over a long shot of a gas station\r\nat night; florescent lights surrounded by pitch-black darkness. With memories\r\nof George Sluizer\u2019s \"The Vanishing,\" and that eerie isolation we all feel in\r\nsuch places, Cuenca creates a sense of unease with just\u00a0one establishing shot,\r\nand he amplifies the intensity when the credits end, the camera pans down to a\r\nwheel & dashboard, and Cuenca reveals that it\u2019s been a POV shot: a madman chasing the\r\nweary travelers at the station. What follows is equally effective as Carlos\r\n(Antonio de la Torre) chases his targets, causing an accident, and carting a\r\nvictim home for, well, dinner. Carlos is the \u201ctitle character,\u201d a man who eats\r\nthe flesh of other men and has been so isolated emotionally that the intrusion\r\nof two women into his life shatters his precise worldview.  Advertisement \r\n\r\nCarlos is a well-respected tailor in Granada. He also eats\r\npeople. Cuenca avoids gore but gets the point across in moments that don't involve actual ingestion, such as when Carlos\r\nplaces his first victim on a table and smells her body like a chef smells a\r\npiece of fish for freshness. This is not \u201cHannibal\u201d-level grotesquery but more\r\nglimpses of a terrifying life lived behind closed doors. In one of the film\u2019s\r\nbest moments, Carlos\u2019 new neighbor Alexandra (Olimpia Melinte) opens his\r\nrefrigerator to see that it\u2019s filled only with bloody packages, to which she\r\nsays, \u201cYou only have meat. Why do you only have meat?\u201d  Shortly after that inquiry with no good answer, Alexandra goes missing. Her\r\nsister Nina (also played by Melinte) comes to investigate the disappearance and\r\nfinds herself drawn to the quiet tailor who lives downstairs. She may find\r\nsomething intriguing about the supportive Carlos but we know not only is he a\r\nserial killer but probably ate her sister. You can imagine how well that love\r\naffair unfolds. The entire first act has that visual sparseness of the\r\nopening scene: Carlos watching his new neighbor through a window, doing his\r\njob, preparing his meals, etc. There\u2019s an almost complete lack of dialogue that\r\nfuels the unease. It makes sense that Carlos wouldn\u2019t talk to himself. However,\r\nas \u201cCannibal\u201d progresses it becomes both more traditional in its narrative and\r\nfrustrating in its lack of depth. Cannibalism is really an unexplored part of\r\nCarlos\u2019 personality in the film. A single episode of NBC\u2019s \u201cHannibal\u201d gets\r\ndeeper into the disturbed mind of a man who eats other men than the entirety of\r\n\u201cCannibal.\u201d While it\u2019s somewhat respectable that Cuenca turns something as\r\ninherently wrong as cannibalism into\u00a0little more than a\u00a0protagonist\u2019s fatal flaw, ignoring its\r\ngreater implications and even how Carlos developed such a nasty habit makes for\r\na film that can feel hollow.  There are moments in \u201cCannibal\u201d that hint at a better film:\r\nThat opening scene. A terrifying sequence in the middle of pitch-black night in\r\nwhich a naked woman knows the rolling waters away from shore that likely hold\r\ndeath are preferable to the mysterious man on the beach waiting for her in the\r\nother direction. A few revelatory beats in the final act. And the performers\r\nare all strong, especially Melinte.  Despite those moments, knowing as little about Carlos as we do makes for a film\r\nthat frustrates. Why does he push out\r\nAlexandra but invite Nina in? As hard as it is to imagine consistency in the\r\nmind of a cannibal, there are actions that Carlos takes in regard to Nina that\r\nfeel like screenwriting devices. Is he trapping her? Is he falling in love at\r\nfirst sight? Why has a killer of women found someone to be kind to? There\r\nseems to be deep sexual dysfunction, of course, but, like too many elements of\r\nthe film, it\u2019s never really explored. Ultimately, Cuenca keeps us in that\r\nopening shot\u2014far from the action\u2014and never makes the narrative switch to really\r\ngive us the POV of a \u201cCannibal.\u201d Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
