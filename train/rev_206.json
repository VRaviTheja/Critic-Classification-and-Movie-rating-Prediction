{"Title": "Leap!", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "The emotional and visual power of dance is so great that even a mediocre film can stoke our affection merely by showing it. The mediocre film in question is \u201cLeap!,\u201d the title of which will henceforth be typed without the exclamation point, because exclamation points are not only typographically irritating but emblematic of a shallow hucksterism that undercuts the entire project. This story of a plucky orphan from Brittany who tries to make it as a ballet star in Paris is set almost 150 years ago, and lacks magic, talking animals, pop culture references that will be dated\u00a0six months from now, and other tics common to so American-made cartoon features done in the Pixar-DreamWorks-BlueSky mold. It also bears the pedigree of a French entertainment conglomerate, Gaumont, and its technical credits are filled with Gallic names. So there\u2019s every reason to hope for something more than the same-old, same-old; something culturally specific and visually exciting; something with an active brain and a beating heart\u2014if not an eccentric gem like \u201cThe Triplets of Belleville\u201d or \u201cA Cat in Paris,\u201d then maybe a crowdpleaser that\u2019s as simultaneously accessible and endearing as a second-tier Pixar release like \u201cFinding Dory\u201d or \u201cThe Good Dinosaur.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement No such luck. Co-directors \u00c9ric Summer and \u00c9ric Warin and their collaborators seem determined to crush the life out of an original premise and many promising characters by stealing every available page out of a substandard American studio animated feature\u2019s playbook, from nonstop CGI-powered, 3-D animation clich\u00e9s (montages set to contemporary power-pop ballads; gratuitous \"slow motion\" to highlight big moments; \u201chelicopter shots\u201d pointlessly flying around buildings and characters) to lead characters that are written, designed and animated in such an obvious, overly emphatic way that \"Leap\" stands as a rare cartoon feature that can be legitimately criticized for bad acting.\u00a0 Wannabe-dancer Felicie (Elle Fanning), who steals another girl\u2019s identity to study at the Paris Opera Ballet; her fellow orphan Victor (Nat Wolff), an aspiring inventor; Felicie\u2019s mentor and soon-to-be-mother figure, Odette (Carlie Rae Jepsen); Odette\u2019s villainous employer R\u00e9gine Le Haut (Julie Khaner); R\u00e9gine\u2019s hateful ballerina daughter Camille (Maddie Ziegler)\u2014these and other major figures are defined entirely by their function in the film\u2019s plot: the heroine, the best friend, the villain, and so on. But in contrast to, well, good animated films aimed at family audiences, \"Leap\" seems stymied as to how to move beyond those basics. It tries to pump them up with characterization substitutes, mainly piling on physical infirmities: crossed or lazy eyes; a speech impediment and gluttonous tendencies; gap teeth and a grating laugh. There\u2019s even a one-scene cameo by a mail courier with '80s-movie, swishy-gay mannerisms. When that gambit fails, the film will latch onto bits of allegedly comic business that aren't all that funny in the first place, and become less funny the more often \"Leap\" repeats them. Victor\u2019s social and physical ineptitude, for instance, is illustrated by having him bang his head on the same church bell three times in the film\u2019s opening section, then stumble, tumble and crash through every scene in which he subsequently appears, when he\u2019s not stammering and stumbling over his words and then vocally chastising himself for messing them up. Odette fares slightly better, mainly because of Jepsen\u2019s sensitive line readings and the long face and sad, dark eyes that the animators have given her. But we deduce her tragic secret the instant we meet her, and the movie, which seems averse to giving either parents or children credit for movie-going intelligence, treats her inevitable backstory-revelation as deep and powerful, when it's actually far less compelling than the relationship she develops organically with F\u00e9licie through their shared love of dance. Mel Brooks\u2019 vocal performance as M. Luteau, the outwardly hard-nosed orphanage supervisor with a secretly soft heart, invests him with a bit of life beyond his\u00a0exopthalmia\u00a0and hunched-over posture; but like so many minor characters in \u201cLeap,\u201d he\u2019s undercut by throwaway dialogue that sounds as if it was dropped into the soundtrack during post-production to explain things that don't need explaining. (When Luteau helps the heroine in the last act\u2014a moment anyone who\u2019s seen a movie before, any movie, will eagerly anticipate\u2014F\u00e9licie exclaims \u201cI knew you weren\u2019t as bad as people say!\u201d) Advertisement F\u00e9licie\u2019s story becomes compelling anyway because it couples an expression of pure willpower with that foolproof sports-and-arts movie standby, the training montage in which new skills are practiced and mastered. The best thing about \u201cLeap\u201d is its portrayal of the dance world, then and now, as both exhilarating and cruel: practically an altar that fanatical young people sacrifice their bodies upon. Anybody who\u2019s danced or been close to a dancer will testify to the emotional truth of the sequences where Odette puts F\u00e9licie through her paces, as well as to the knife-twisting comments that the Paris Opera Ballet\u2019s choreographer M\u00e9rante (Terrence Scammell) makes as he cuts girls from a lineup of potential \u201cSwan Lake\" leads. But \u201cLeap\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to grasp how special these elements are. Rather than do its brave, tough, purehearted heroine the courtesy of concentrating on her artistic and emotional evolution and the indignities and injuries she suffers for her art, it keeps wasting her time (and ours) with theoretically comic or suspenseful subplots that we\u2019ve seen done many times before, with considerably more wit and feeling. The love triangle between the bumbling best friend-nice guy (Victor) and the tall, blond, full-of-himself rival (Tamer Kapelian\u2019s Rudolph), who claims to be a Russian prince, soon becomes tedious because neither young man seems charismatic enough to steal the spotlight away from F\u00e9licie\u2019s true, great love, dance. More exasperating is the sneering, shallow hatefulness of the rival\u2019s mother, R\u00e9gine. She's been given Cinderella\u2019s stepmother\u2019s hell-pit eyes and fitted with a jet-black version of her tumorous hairdo, as if her constant physical humiliation of F\u00e9licie and Odette, literally her chambermaids, didn\u2019t cement that connection for us straightaway. The film\u2019s misallocation of dramatic resources reaches a bizarre zenith in the finale, which delays the heroine\u2019s understudy-who-gets-a-big-break debut (another ancient clich\u00e9 that we spot from a thousand yards off, and can\u2019t wait to see and revel in) for a long action sequence set beneath and near just-finished Eiffel Tower and the unfinished Statue of Liberty. It seems mainly interested in proving that Victor was the right guy for F\u00e9licie all along. Given how invested we\u2019ve become in her quest at that point, despite all the prefabricated storytelling hurdles placed between her and her debut, Victor's vindication is the last thing on our minds. F\u00e9licie deserves better. So does dance.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
