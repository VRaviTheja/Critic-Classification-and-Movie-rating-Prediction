{"Title": "Marauders", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "How do movies like \u201cMarauders\u201d get made? One assumes that\r\nevery film has a creative impetus at some point in its production, but it\u2019s\r\nincredibly hard to find one buried underneath this morally vile, incompetently\r\nmade thriller. And so one has to wonder if it wasn\u2019t a \u201cpaycheck gig\u201d for\r\neveryone involved. Was it merely the \u201cbusiness\u201d aspect of show business? Or did director\r\nSteven C. Miller set out to make an intense thriller about on-the-edge cops and\r\ndeadly criminals that would rivet viewers to their seats and justify their\r\nticket or On Demand costs? Even for how negatively I responded to the\r\nbafflingly inept \u201cMarauders,\u201d I choose to believe that Miller and his overly\r\ntalented cast didn\u2019t just do it for a paycheck. Even with that in mind, it\u2019s\r\nhard to forgive. Advertisement \u201cMarauders\u201d opens with a scene straight out of this year\u2019s \u201cTriple\r\n9,\u201d as a series of masked men pull off a complex bank heist. They\u2019re dressed\r\nlike the protagonists from the video game \u201cArmy of Two\u201d (impersonal/terrifying skull\r\nmasks and bulletproof gear), and they\u2019re highly-coordinated and technologically\r\nsavvy. They even throw down speakers, so a Siri-esque voice can issue orders\r\ninstead of the actual attackers\u2014ex., \u201cDo not hit the alarm or we will kill your\r\nmanager.\u201d They complete the assault, and on the way out they shoot said bank\r\nmanager point blank with a shotgun. From the beginning, \u201cMarauders\u201d displays\r\nsigns of hyperactive, inept filmmaking, the kind that uses shaky cams and quick\r\ncuts instead of actual visual compositions. It\u2019s angry, loud and annoying. We soon learn that the bank was owned by a high-powered\r\nfigure named Hubert (Bruce Willis, doing the bare minimum he can to get paid),\r\nwho hides secrets of political and business leaders in his safety deposit\r\nboxes. Of course, the criminals of \u201cMarauders\u201d have more complex goals than\r\nmere accumulation of wealth, which is something that FBI Agent Jonathan\r\nMontgomery (Christopher Meloni) quickly uncovers, with the help of fellow\r\nagents Stockwell (Dave Bautista) and Wells (Adrian Grenier), and local cop Mims\r\n(Johnathon Schaech). Mims happens to have a wife dying of cancer, which should\r\nadd to depth to his character but just feels manipulative. \u201cMarauders\u201d is such a by-the-numbers VOD-cop movie that it becomes depressing. A few scenes of plot furtherance as Montgomery\r\ntries to uncover the identity and purpose of the robber-murderers unfold, and\r\nthen we get another crime, and then a bit more procedural, and then another\r\ncrime, and then a conclusion. Roll credits. In between this predictable\r\nstructure, we\u2019re given next to nothing to care about. Meloni is an interesting\r\nchoice for the role that essentially becomes the lead (he\u2019s an underrated actor\r\nwho more often gets supporting roles) but the writers bestow him almost nothing\r\ninteresting to play, forcing anger to become his defining trait. Hence, he\r\nopens doors like he\u2019s mad at them. Grenier looks bored and Bautista gives a\r\nsupporting part more than it deserves. Advertisement And then there\u2019s the final act, full of revelations and twists\r\ndesigned to shock but just rips gigantic plot holes in the rest of\r\nthe film, while also forcing it into a morally dubious conclusion. What is the\r\npoint of \u201cMarauders\u201d? One can\u2019t take it seriously as social commentary at all,\r\nbut it tries so hard to include that kind of material that it feels like it\r\nwants to be more than \u201cdumb fun.\u201d I\u2019m all for a well-made action film, even of\r\nthe VOD variety, that delivers the thrills. But \u201cMarauders\u201d forgot the \u201cfun\u201d\r\npart. It\u2019s just \u201cdumb.\u201d", "Critic": "Beta"}
