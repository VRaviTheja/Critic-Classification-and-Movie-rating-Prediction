{"Title": "Queen of Earth", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Alex Ross Perry\u2019s \u201cQueen of Earth\u201d is as unsettling as any\r\nhorror film that you\u2019ll see this year but it so by virtue of its filmmaking and\r\nits performances instead of a twisting and turning narrative. Echoing dramas of\r\ninternal conflict turned into threats of physical danger like \u201cPersona\u201d and \u201cRepulsion,\u201d\r\nPerry explores the concept that it is the human mind and its emotional undercurrents\r\nthat is the most terrifying thing in the world. Anchored by incredible\r\nperformances from Elisabeth Moss and Katherine Waterston, this is one of the\r\nmost mesmerizing pictures of the year.  Advertisement \u201cQueen of Earth\u201d opens with a tone-defining close-up of\r\nCatherine (Moss). Her makeup has run into bags around her eyes, her hair is\r\ndisheveled, and she is emotionally drained. It is brutal, unsparing and direct.\r\nPerry doesn\u2019t pull back and offer much coverage, just a couple close-ups of\r\nCatherine\u2019s now-ex-boyfriend James (Kentucker Audley). He is breaking up with\r\nher, and she is not taking it well, noting that this is the kind of emotional\r\nblow, coming shortly after the death of her father, that will devastate her. As\r\nwe will quickly learn, Catherine was one of those people who was deeply\r\nco-dependent on two men in her life\u2014her father and her boyfriend. When the\r\nformer dies and the latter leaves her, she will be totally adrift and border on\r\nunstable. To try to bring her back to Earth, friend Virginia\r\n(Waterston), Ginny to her friends but only\r\nher friends, invites Catherine to spend the weekend at her family\u2019s cabin in\r\nthe woods. Editor Robert Greene deftly intercuts back to a similar weekend a\r\nyear ago in which the roles were reversed\u2014Catherine was there with James and\r\nVirginia was the lonely third wheel, resentful that a girls\u2019 weekend turned\r\ninto a triangle. Almost subconsciously (but maybe not so sub-) creating the same dynamic a year later, Virginia\r\ninvites her neighbor Rich (Patrick Fugit) to spend time with her and Catherine\r\non this sun-kissed weekend. Catherine hates Rich. It could be just because he represents\r\na gender she doesn\u2019t feel like seeing right now, or that, like Virginia last\r\nyear, she resents her emotional healing being invaded. If this all sounds like the set-up for a mumblecore drama,\r\nyou\u2019re not wrong. And yet \u201cQueen of Earth\u201d has a very different tone than the\r\nwork of Joe Swanberg. First, there\u2019s the unusual friendship between Virginia\r\nand Catherine, two people who can be devastatingly, dangerously honest with\r\neach other. They take stabs at each other to see how much the other one will emotionally\r\nbleed. They are kind of awful to one another in the way friends know the buttons\r\nto push that enemies do not. Ginny accuses Catherine of living in her father\u2019s\r\nshadow and tied to her ex-boyfriend, almost as if she\u2019s pushing her friend\r\ndeeper into depression, knowing she has to face some realities before she can\r\nreturn to normalcy. And Perry very carefully focuses more often on the\r\nlistener, more interested in the impact of what\u2019s being said on the person who\r\nhears it than the act of saying it. Advertisement That impact pushes Catherine closer to the edge of sanity.\r\nShe tells a visitor one night, \u201cYou know,\r\nI could kill you and no one would know,\u201d and Moss delivers the line with\r\njust the right mix of humor and truth, as if she\u2019s only half-kidding. Perry\r\nalso uses ominous music throughout \u201cQueen of Earth,\u201d much like the\r\npsychological thrillers from the \u201870s that the film sometimes cribs from,\r\nraising tension through score as much as action. We feel something bad is going to happen. Will Catherine kill herself?\r\nKill someone else? Her world has shattered and every way in which she defines\r\nherself (she even worked for her father) is gone. As she says, \u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I exist anymore.\u201d\r\nAnd Ginny says she cares about Catherine\u2019s recovery, but does she? \u201cQueen of\r\nEarth\u201d is terrifying because it is so emotionally unmoored\u2014Catherine is a\r\ncharacter with little reason to care about anything or anyone, and Perry and\r\nMoss convey the danger of that brilliantly. Moss has been a TV awards regular for her great work on \u201cMad\r\nMen,\u201d and killed it last year in \u201cThe One I Love\u201d and Perry\u2019s \u201cListen Up\r\nPhilip,\u201d but this is the best work of her career. She is both shattered and\r\nterrifying, the kind of person you want to help but who you\u2019re a little scared\r\nto talk to. She plays Catherine as totally psychologically untethered and\r\ndrifting further away from normalcy, but she doesn\u2019t chew the scenery in doing\r\nso, grounding Catherine\u2019s breakdown in realism. Waterston is just as good,\r\nproving that breakthrough in \u201cInherent Vice\u201d last year was no fluke. Her third\r\nact work here is particularly terrific, as Ginny starts to realize that\r\nCatherine may not be exactly where Ginny was last year\u2014she\u2019s further down the road\r\nof depression. Like the emotional turmoil of real heartbreak, \u201cQueen of\r\nEarth\u201d refuses easy answers. It will frustrate some viewers in its lack of\r\nconclusions, but Perry is more interested in tension than pay-off. Those hazy,\r\nuncertain days of our lives when our definitions of ourselves have to change\r\nand we\u2019re not even really sure who our friends are or how we feel about them makes\r\nfor remarkably ambitious territory for a filmmaker to explore. Alex Ross Perry\r\nis a remarkable filmmaker.", "Critic": "Beta"}
