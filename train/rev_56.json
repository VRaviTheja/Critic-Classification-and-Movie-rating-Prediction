{"Title": "Blockers", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cBlockers\u201d is about six movies in one, and only about four of them work. It\u2019s the kind of comedy one could stumble upon late at night on HBO and thoroughly enjoy, but it strains under the weight of its tonal inconsistencies in a movie theater. It veers wildly from the style of a coming-of-age comedy like \u201cSuperbad\u201d to something more family-oriented and heartfelt to the gross-out/raunch flicks we saw in the wake of the success of \u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary.\u201d There\u2019s something almost admirable about a comedy that gives you whiplash as it jumps from heartfelt conversations about the emotional trauma a parent faces when their child grows up to a scene in which John Cena chugs beer with his asshole, but it gets exhausting watching \u201cBlockers\u201d jump so many hurdles.\u00a0 Advertisement Parents Lisa (Leslie Mann), Mitchell (John Cena) and Hunter (Ike Barinholtz) watch their little girls meet outside of elementary school on their first day, an emotional experience for any parent. As the trio realizes that their kids have become fast-friends, Hunter jokes that this means now these strangers must be friends too\u2014as we all know you\u2019ll spend more time with the parents of your kid\u2019s friends than your actual ones. Hunter then asks if they want to go get a beer, and Mitchell starts to cry (\u201cBlockers\u201d gets a lot of mileage out of the visual of a guy Cena's size\u00a0getting emotional).    Cut to a bookend milestone of educational life, Prom Night. We learn that Lisa, a single mother, has formed a loving relationship with her daughter Julie (a charismatic Kathryn Newton), but that she may be a little clingy as the young lady is about to leave her on her own. Julie speaks of wanting to go all the way to UCLA (the film takes place in Chicago) and Lisa is clearly rattled at the idea of losing her baby girl at all, much less going that far away. Mann plays the desperation and fear of being along on Lisa\u2019s part just subtly enough for it to work. It\u2019s a part that plays to her strengths as an actress, particularly a very funny speech in which she breaks down at the thought of dying alone. Director Kay Cannon is constantly allowing her three leads to play to their strengths\u2014Mann\u2019s borderline smothering, Cena\u2019s softie-in-a-tough-shell, and Barinholtz\u2019s wise-cracking smart-ass.    But what are they blocking, you say? Well,\u00a0Julie\u2019s two best friends\u2014the adventurous Kayla (Geradline Viswanathan) and shyer Sam (Gideon Adlon)\u2014are sitting in school just before Prom Night and discussing how Julie is planning to finally have sex that night with her boyfriend Austin (Graham Phillips). Kayla wants in on the shared experience, and decides she\u2019ll do the deed with Connor (Miles Robbins), and Sam, even though she\u2019s way more interested in a lesbian at her school named Marcie (Sarayu Blue), decides she\u2019ll join in as well with her date. As the trio of couples head out on a night of debauchery, Julie accidentally leaves a group chat open on her laptop and the girls\u2019 parents, in a very funny scene, decipher the emojis and discern the plan. Even though Hunter initially balks, they head out to save the girls from doing something they\u2019ll regret.    Advertisement Despite what you may have thought from the trailers, Cannon is careful not to deliver a comedy that relies on the double standard that has long-defined teenage boys and girls regarding sex. In fact, Julie and Mitchell are constantly being called out on their bullshit. Lisa had Julie at a young age, and doesn\u2019t want the same for her daughter, but it\u2019s also crystal-clear that Julie is in love with Austin and this is no mere hook-up. In \"Blockers,\"\u00a0sex, and experimentation in general,\u00a0is treated as a natural part of the evolution into adulthood and it\u2019s the parents trying to hold it back who are the relics. Some of the best parts of\u00a0\u201cBlockers\u201d make it clear how much being overprotective leaves you stuck in time, and presents the teens as progressive/woke/etc. in a clever, modern way. Clearly, there are some decent ideas for a comedy in \u201cBlockers,\u201d and some very funny scenes from a cast with rock-solid comic timing, but the movie was either rewritten one too many times or one too few. Whatever the case, it\u2019s an understatement to say that it\u2019s all over the map tonally. The first half-hour or so really worked for me, as it became clear how much Cannon could get from a talented cast (not just the adults, but the kids work too, especially scene-stealer Viswanathan), but then \u201cBlockers\u201d falls into that trap where every subsequent scene has to up the ante in terms of insanity. It loses the emotional grounding that feels genuine in the opening scenes as the drugs, booze, and lunacy gets turned up to 11 in an effort to \u201ctop\u201d something like \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d or \u201cSuperbad.\u201d \u201cBlockers\u201d has five credited writers (Ed.-It did at SXSW but has since been reduced to two), and you would be able to guess that if I hadn't told you. It\u2019s just\u00a0incredibly difficult to balance the wildly divergent tones in a movie that features more sex jokes than any I\u2019ve seen in years with characters that feel real talking about going away to school and leaving their parents and friends.\u00a0 With that in mind, it\u2019s notable how close \u201cBlockers\u201d gets to working. The crowd I saw it with at SXSW\u2014a festival that\u2019s become notable for mainstream comedy debuts, launching \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d and more in recent years\u2014ate it up and used words like hysterical on their way out. The film is\u00a0undeniably funny, and I\u2019d like a world in which Cena/Mann/Barinholtz get more work\u2014AND, even more importantly, where more female directors are hired to direct R-rated studio\u00a0comedies. I just hope the next one is a little better than \u201cBlockers.\u201d This review was filed from the 2018 SXSW Film Festival on March 11, 2018. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
