{"Title": "American Violence", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "Is the death penalty justified punishment or merely a perpetuation of a cycle of violence that has become so ingrained in American society that it can\u2019t be stopped? It\u2019s a theme commonly returned to in fiction and film, including the remarkably incompetent \u201cAmerican Violence,\u201d which pretends to be interested in exploring complex issues about how violence begets violence but is so poorly made that one has to push their way past so much amateurish filmmaking just to find an issue or two worth discussing. This is a bizarrely inept film, one that includes dialogue that most teenagers would have edited and a plot that strains credulity at every turn. There are plenty of true stories that one could use to shine a light on the arguable hypocrisy of a system that takes an eye for an eye, but \u201cAmerican Violence\u201d seems defiantly unconcerned with addressing the actual issues at play, delivering a generic crime thriller instead. And a bad one at that. Advertisement If you struggled with Denise Richards playing a nuclear scientist in \u201cThe World is Not Enough,\u201d you may equally have trouble buying her as Dr. Amanda Tyler, a renowned psychologist asked to speak to a man on death row named Jackson Shea (Kaiwi Lyman-Mersereau). The request to Dr. Tyler from Ben Woods (Columbus Short) is mere PR\u2014they want to say they spoke to him before considering a stay, but aren\u2019t that serious about the issue\u2014but Tyler takes it seriously. She sets up with Shea much like Clarice set up with Dr. Lecter in \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d right down to the standalone cell in the middle of the room. However, that\u2019s where the comparisons to Demme\u2019s masterpiece stop for director Timothy Woodward Jr., who isn\u2019t nearly interested enough in the doctor-psycho relationship. In fact, the structure of the film, in which we see Shea\u2019s life story in flashback, basically sidelines Richards for most of the film. Believe it or not, that\u2019s a complaint. Shea\u2019s story is as generic and predictable as you\u2019d expect it to be. It opens with him being abused by an uncle as a child; moves on to a criminal enterprise in which he and a buddy robbed doctors who were taking cash payments and then billing insurance companies; features him crossing paths with an even-tougher bad guy; gets a woman involved, of course; and even gets a sequence of prison rape and an evil warden (played with why-am-I-here nonchalance by Bruce Dern). It\u2019s one of those films in which even the flashbacks can\u2019t stay consistent. There\u2019s a scene between a tough guy that Shea robbed and some cops that can\u2019t really exist in Shea\u2019s flashback story to Tyler because he\u2019s not there.  The performances are uniformly bad from top to bottom in \u201cAmerican Violence,\u201d although one starts to feel sorry for the cast given the dialogue they\u2019ve been asked to deliver. Two favorites are \u201cWe\u2019re all just caged animals \u2026 with animal instincts\u201d and \u201cThe only reason you\u2019re still alive \u2026 is I haven\u2019t killed you yet.\u201d Shea\u2019s story just isn\u2019t interesting thematically or narratively, and the film\u2019s only bright spot comes when New England Patriots all-star Rob Gronkowski shows up as a tough guy. It\u2019s not that Gronk is particularly good (although he cuts a striking enough figure to buy him as a bodyguard) but at least it\u2019s something to stop the boredom. Then he\u2019s gone again and we\u2019re back to the clich\u00e9s and the pretension. \u201cAmerican Violence\u201d is one of those truly awful films that not only has nothing to say, but can\u2019t even be entertaining as B-movie pulp.
