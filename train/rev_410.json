{"Title": "The Wave", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Norwegian hit \u201cThe Wave\u201d strikes all the expected beats of\r\nan American blockbuster disaster movie like \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow\u201d or \u201cSan Andreas.\u201d\r\nThere\u2019s the long set-up in which only one man knows the truth about the\r\nimpending destruction. There\u2019s the event itself, designed to amaze audiences with its \u201ccould that really happen\u201d intensity. And there\u2019s the\r\nrecovery final act, in which the world has changed for the characters and they\r\nhave to struggle to get back together. It\u2019s a structure that can be underappreciated\r\nin that if any of these three acts are too long or poorly done, the suspension\r\nof disbelief is punctured and a disaster movie becomes, well, a disaster\r\nitself. What\u2019s interesting about \u201cThe Wave\u201d is stepping back and considering\r\njust how well-constructed the whole thing is. The slow-burn build-up is just\r\nlong enough, the disaster itself is just harrowing enough and the final act is\r\njust intense enough to keep us engaged. It\u2019s what one would call a \u201csturdy\u201d genre pic\u2014it doesn\u2019t break any ground (pun kinda intended), but it gets the job done. Advertisement Geiranger is one of the most coveted tourist spots in all of\r\nNorway. It\u2019s easy to see why. The gorgeous views of the mountains and its crystal\r\nclear lakes bring new travelers every year. Of course, as the opening news\r\nfootage warns us, any village at the base of a mountain, especially one as big\r\nas \u00c5kerneset, is a ticking time bomb. Over ominous footage of landslides\r\nhurtling towards small towns, we hear \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the\r\nnext big disaster.\u201d If we\u2019ve learned anything from cinema, it\u2019s that Mother\r\nNature hates you and is going to kill you. It\u2019s a wonder we don\u2019t all live in\r\nshelters. The canary in this coalmine is Kristian (Kristoffer Joner),\r\nthe most vigilant employee at a Geiranger warning center. What\u2019s a warning\r\ncenter, you ask? Well, the likelihood of a rockslide, and the accompanying wave\r\nthat would come careening through the valley should enough water be displaced,\r\ndemands a staff of people who monitor the land and water. Kristian is leaving\r\nhis post, moving to the city with his wife and kids. Of course, he leaves a day\r\ntoo late. First, there are just some odd readings about groundwater on the\r\nmountain disappearing. Then there\u2019s Kristian\u2019s realization that the substratum are shifting so drastically that an avalanche is inevitable. Of course, the\r\nrest of his staff just think he\u2019s crying wolf. There isn\u2019t a movie if they\u2019re\r\nnot apprehensive, when, in reality, they\u2019d probably be dying to push the big\r\nred button that launches the siren that warns Geiranger that they have ten\r\nminutes before they\u2019re underwater. \u201cThe Wave\u201d hits all of the right beats for its genre. There\u2019s\r\nthe foreboding score as the camera slowly zooms in on Kristian\u2019s face behind\r\nthe wheel, stopped in traffic and just realizing what the latest readings\r\nmeant. There are shots of birds flying in the other direction of the mountain.\r\nThere\u2019s even a great scene in which one of the analysts is watching a slasher\r\nmovie on his laptop as lights start to blink red behind him. The Jason Voorhees\r\nof \u201cThe Wave\u201d is Mother Nature. If there's a criticism of the structure here, it's that the build-up act of \u201cThe Wave\u201d is a little too long. After\r\nKristian knows something is afoot, and we clearly know that he\u2019s right, there\u2019s\r\na bit too much wheel-spinning before we get to the titular event. However, said\r\nevent does not disappoint. Kristian and his daughter are headed for higher\r\nground while his wife and son are at the hotel at which she works, trying to\r\nget residents to safety before getting trapped in an underground bunker. When\r\nthe wave hits, it does so with biblical force, and director Roar Uthaug does an\r\nexcellent job of keeping the danger tactile. Water rushing into a room or\r\nsmashing into a car doesn\u2019t feel like typical Hollywood CGI, which allows the\r\nstakes to resonate. He\u2019s been tapped to reboot \u201cTomb Raider,\u201d and I hope he\r\nbrings the same energy to that franchise that he did here. Lara Croft ain't got nothing on Mother Nature.
