{"Title": "Dave Made a Maze", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "One thing needs to be cleared up right away. This movie is a quirky fantasy-adventure-comedy co-written and directed by Bill Watterson, in his behind-the-camera debut. Before you get all excited, it must be clarified: Not THAT Bill Watterson. The semi-reclusive \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d creator has not made his way to Los Angeles to pursue a new vision that only the cinema can contain. No, this Bill Watterson is a film and television actor in his early 40s, two conditions that do inform this movie\u2019s vision.  Advertisement The movie begins with video footage of the title character, who asks of the folks behind the camera interviewing him that they not make him look \u201cangry and spineless.\u201d Apparently this is the aftermath of Dave\u2019s project, an in-apartment maze (\u201clabyrinth\u201d is the more accurate term, Dave insists, and he has proof) that he made simply because, as he puts it, \u201cI wanted to make something.\u201d And apparently the thing he made has gotten a couple of people killed.  A title sequence shows Dave (Nick Thune) to be a creative type\u2014a to-do board on one wall of his place instructs him to \u201cFinish Concept Album.\u201d But what he does instead one afternoon is construct a cardboard castle in his living room. His girlfriend Annie (Meera Rohit Kumbhani) comes home and Dave instructs her not to enter the thing. It\u2019s bigger and deeper than she knows and he\u2019s stuck in it, trying to find a way out. He asks her to call his best friend Gordon (Adam Busch) for assistance.  When Gordon arrives, he and echoey Dave launch into a bit of struggling-Hollywood-bro banter, or at least that\u2019s what I assume it is. \u201cWhere\u2019s that beard at?\u201d Dave shouts. \u201cThe beard is on the face,\u201d Gordon responds. Gordon has a beard, you see. Anyway, running counter to Dave\u2019s directions, Annie has also invited all of Dave\u2019s friends over. They all look like they\u2019re headed for a Dan Zanes concert but forgot to bring the actual children for whom the concert is in fact intended. Among these folk is a camera crew\u2014these are the characters who interview Dave, not after the adventure but in the middle of it.  The all-live action section of this movie is lit and shot almost exactly like an episode of \u201cThe Adventures of Pete and Pete.\u201d That\u2019s not a bad thing in and of itself, but as relatively swinging as it was, \u201cThe Adventures of Pete and Pete\u201d was a children\u2019s show. Once the party turns into a rescue party, and Dave\u2019s pals all enter the labyrinth against his strident objections (the videographer yells \u201cDon\u2019t look at the camera,\u201d just like in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d ar ar ar), things get a little more visually interesting. Since the maze (labyrinth, sorry) is made of cardboard, the attendant visual effects, most of them in-camera, are deliberately low-tech and funky. There are gear-heavy booby traps. Characters are beheaded, or \u201cbeheaded,\u201d but when they are, streams of red wool thread shoot from their necks. There\u2019s a part of the labyrinth in which the characters transform into cardboard hand puppets. There\u2019s a section in which the characters turn to black and white. At this juncture, Annie forgets how mad she is at Dave long enough to join him and Gordon in doing bad impressions of Robert De Niro in \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d There\u2019s even a zoetrope. It\u2019s all very Hipster Etsy. Keeping things tense is a Minotaur, some guy the filmmakers probably picked up around Gold\u2019s Gym and put a cardboard horned head on. Advertisement I was wondering who exactly this movie was made for, and how I could avoid them, when in the middle of the picture Dave expels a cri de coeur, tied into the \u201cI wanted to make something\u201d riff. He says he hates the fact \u201cthat I still get money from my parents and I bore them,\u201d which is so on the money I almost felt bad for the guy. This feeling dissipated as this movie, a \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d for artisanal yogurt connoisseurs, ended, with a song called \u201cPinball,\u201d by the band Tandemoro. \u201cSippin\u2019 my beer/playin\u2019 pinball/yeah\u201d goes the chorus. Listening, I had never felt happier to be approaching senior citizenship. Come back Mumblecore, all is forgiven.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
