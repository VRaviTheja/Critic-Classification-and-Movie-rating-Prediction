{"Title": "The Scribbler", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "With narrative echoes of \u201cSucker Punch\u201d and stylistic\r\ncommonalities with \u201cSin City,\u201d one would expect John Suits\u2019 \u201cThe Scribbler,\u201d\r\nadapted by graphic novelist Dan Schaffer, to at least be a bit of escapist fun.\r\nA female empowerment, mental illness-defeating, noir-esque comic book movie\r\nwith B-movie Goddesses like Gina Gershon, Sasha Grey and Eliza Dushku? Where do\r\nI buy tickets? And yet \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d never clicks into the escapist mind f**k\r\nit really needed to be to work. It can't maintain its style and never finds its substance. It\u2019s a ridiculous narrative with scenery-chewing\r\nperformances, but it doesn\u2019t have the form to match. It\u2019s dull when one wants\r\nit to be ludicrous, and serves as a reminder of how hard it is to bring comic books to celluloid life on a limited budget. Advertisement Suki (Katie Cassidy) has multiple personalities, one of\r\nwhich is the title character. Her Doctor (Billy Campbell) has developed a\r\ntechnique known as \u201cThe Siamese Burn,\u201d which is essentially a massive shock to\r\nthe system designed to destroy the extraneous personalities one at a time. But\r\nwhich ones are extraneous? And what will she do when she\u2019s down to two?\r\nQuestions like these linger in the background of what is also a poorly-written\r\nmystery. The \u201cBurn\u201d subplot is actually part of a flashback conveyed through an\r\ninvestigation by two police officers (Eliza Dushku, Michael Imperioli) into why\r\nall of Suki\u2019s fellow inhabitants of Juniper Tower happen to be showing up dead.\r\nThe Tower is a halfway house for the \u201cmentally and socially inept,\u201d which\r\nallows for a cavalcade of odd characters, including a bunny ear-wearing Sasha\r\nGrey, milk bath-taking Gina Gershon, disturbing Michelle Trachtenberg,\r\nscene-stealing Garret Dillahunt and a girl who just walks around naked (Ashlynn\r\nYennie). One by one, most of these characters jump from Juniper Tower, leading\r\none to wonder if \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d doesn\u2019t have echoes of \u201cIdentity\u201d as well and\r\nthese people are all just dying personalities of the film\u2019s protagonist. The best moments of \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d embrace the film\u2019s\r\nridiculous concept with overheated dialogue pulled from the noir/action comic\r\nbook manual. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what happened, from the beginning?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s\r\nnot always the best way to tell a story.\u201d Those lines early in Schaffer\u2019s film\r\nsets it up as a work that will navigate the traditional storytelling structure\r\nin a unique manner, but \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d ends up depressingly linear. And most of\r\nthe subtext\u2014the burning out of personalities could clearly be read a commentary\r\non control of female individuality and sexuality\u2014is underdeveloped to the\r\nextreme. \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d feels like an outline of a better film.  There are times when one can see what \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d could\r\nhave become. Garret Dillahunt, so great on \u201cDeadwood\u201d and \u201cRaising Hope,\u201d is\r\nhaving a blast as the one guy in Juniper Tower, who \u201cchecked the wrong box.\u201d He\r\neven gets a slo-mo sex scene with Cassidy that kind of needs to be seen to be\r\nbelieved. I wanted more of that kind of insanity instead of the drab, episodic\r\npacing of a film that feels way longer than its 88 minutes. It\u2019s ugly when it should\r\nbe crazy. Someone burned all the personality out of it. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
