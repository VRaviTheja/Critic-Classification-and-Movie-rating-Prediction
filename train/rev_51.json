{"Title": "Escobar: Paradise Lost", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Few actors feel as present as Benicio Del Toro, a performer\r\nthat doesn\u2019t play-act, he embodies the characters he portrays. In \u201cEscobar:\r\nParadise Lost,\u201d Del Toro could be playing with children in a pool or ordering a\r\nyoung man to commit murder, and he performs both scenes with the same genuine\r\nintensity. He has such a keen awareness of his surroundings, whether it be his\r\nco-stars, shooting location, or even the few pounds he put on to play someone\r\nas larger than life as Pablo Escobar. He\u2019s really very good here, as he almost\r\nalways is, no matter the quality of the film around him. The rest of the movie?\r\nNot so much. Advertisement \u201cEscobar: Paradise Lost\u201d suffers from the same problem as \u201cMy\r\nWeek with Marilyn,\u201d \u201cMe and Orson Welles\u201d and \u201cThe Last King of Scotland,\u201d\r\nthree films that also chose to capture legendary figures through the eyes of a\r\nrelatable innocent. So, instead of a biopic of Pablo Escobar starring Benicio\r\nDel Toro, we get a fictionalized tale of a Canadian transplant who stumbles\r\ninto Escobar\u2019s circle of influence when he marries Escobar\u2019s beloved niece starring Josh Hutcherson.\r\nBasically, the protagonist is nowhere near as interesting as the title\r\ncharacter, and so whenever Del Toro is off-camera, which is more than half the\r\nfilm, we feel his absence to the degree that one wonders if the film wouldn\u2019t\r\nwork better without the true figure behind it. We have different expectations\r\nfor casting as perfect as \u201cBenicio Del Toro as Pablo Escobar\u201d than we do from \u201cJosh\r\nHutcherson as Some Dumb Canadian.\u201d Nick (Hutcherson) just wants to hang on the beach with his\r\nbrother (Brady Corbet) and his family. They build a surf shack in the middle of\r\nnowhere. Bro will cook; Nick will teach surfing. It truly will be paradise\u2014and debut\r\ndirector Andrea Di Stefano does a solid job of conveying the beauty of this\r\npart of the world. One day, Nick runs into a lovely young woman named Maria\r\n(Claudia Traisac), who asks if he\u2019s going to bring more \u201cYankees\u201d down to their\r\npart of their world. Nick politely corrects her; he\u2019s Canadian. Nick is very\r\npolite. Nick is also a tad na\u00efve. When Maria introduces him to her\r\nrich uncle Pablo Escobar, Nick doesn\u2019t exactly ask the right questions. He does\r\nhappen to wonder aloud how Uncle Pablo has so much money, to which Maria\r\ncasually answers, \u201cCocaine.\u201d Huh? You don't say. Not long later, Nick mentions over polite conversation that some\r\nlocal thugs have been giving him and his brother trouble, including attacking\r\nNick with a violent dog (in a harrowing scene). Anyone who\u2019s seen a movie will\r\nknow the thugs end up dead. And then Nick happens to be on the Escobar estate\r\non a day that he\u2019s not supposed to be there, and things get really bad. Advertisement The second half of \u201cParadise Lost\u201d is actually a pretty\r\nrobust thriller, especially a centerpiece action-suspense scene in which Nick\r\nstruggles to keep his head above water as the world is crashing around him.\r\nThere\u2019s a harrowing phone call or two and some really strong sense of setting,\r\nbuoyed by confident direction, especially for a first-time director. Here\u2019s the\r\nmoment where I realized that it\u2019s not Josh Hutcherson\u2019s fault that his\r\ncharacter doesn\u2019t really work, and not really even Di Stefano\u2019s, but the fact\r\nthat this is two movies grafted into one. On one hand, we have a true story of\r\ncrime and poverty bringing down paradise on Earth. On the other, we have the\r\nstory of an innocent caught in a web of violence. Both films kind of work, and both films are lessened by the way they are smashed together here. Were this just a straightforward,\r\nfictional thriller, it might be pretty effective. But it\u2019s not. The name is right there in the title. And\r\nevery time that Benicio Del Toro shows up as Pablo Escobar, we\u2019re reminded of\r\nthe movie that this could have been, making it easier to criticize the movie it\r\nchose to be instead.", "Critic": "Beta"}
