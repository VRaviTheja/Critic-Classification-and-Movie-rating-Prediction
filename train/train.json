{"Title": "Birdboy: The Forgotten Children", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In his groundbreaking graphic novel Maus, Art Spiegelman took a giant artistic risk that paid off painfully and beautifully. The work is a remembrance/memoir of Spiegelman\u2019s own family and their experience of the Holocaust. The risk is in the telling: Spiegelman cast it as a version of a funny-animal cartoon. Jews were mice, Nazis were cats. The shock of the metaphor, the way the reader had to grapple with its \u201ctaste issues,\u201d and much more, made for an unusually moving and unsettling experience. Advertisement Spiegelman began Maus\u00a0in 1980. In the nearly 40 years since, it has proven influential in varied media (Spiegelman himself accused the 1986 animated film \u201cAn American Tail\u201d of plagiarizing Maus). The new Spanish animated film, \u201cBirdboy: The Forgotten Children,\u201d directed by Alberto V\u00e1zquez and Pedro Rivero, adapted from V\u00e1zquez\u2019s comic, is an oft-grisly and always visually dazzling allegorical fantasy that puts funny animals in a post-dystopian semi-wasteland. The movie opens in darkness, with a child\u2019s voice saying, \u201cThe future is the past, garbage is our present. Blood is our law!\u201d The color palette of a world prior to an industrial accident that looks nuclear or worse is one of pink pastels and black silhouettes.\u00a0 Once disaster hits, the modes are Kafka meets Marquez meets Mickey Mouse and/or Maus, and many more. The central character is Dinky, a little mouse with a persistent robot alarm clock and religious fanatic parents. Her dad likes to teach her lesson while squeezing a ruby Baby Jesus squeak toy, which seems to ooze real blood. Dinky is eager to escape them, and so she sets out with two friends, a rabbit and a fox, to seek a new place to live with Birdboy, a former friend of Dinky\u2019s whose story has acquired mythical dimensions in the time they\u2019ve been apart. In addition to the horrible environment, the kids have to battle their own demons, which encourage them to push each other off cliffs and do other nasty things. A giant black spider chases them around an abandoned house. Eventually they wind up in a waste site, ruled by a rat king and his child cult\u2014these are the ones for which blood is law. In the meantime, Birdboy himself is on a Personal Journey, remembering his lighthouse-keeper father before sinking into the see, to be overwhelmed by parasite-like creatures who look like smushed-up smiley emojis. Advertisement As you might infer, none of this is really kid\u2019s stuff. The good characters endure almost constant beatings, and the baddies are incredibly bloodthirsty and menacing. The variegated but never slick character design and animation is based on relatively simple drawing styles, and yet the characters are as vivid and sometimes scarier than the very technologically advanced nasties of, say, \u201cToy Story 3\u201d (a film to which this actually does owe a bit of a debt). The movie is grisly and its sense of humor is mordant, but it winds up communicating a heartbreak that\u2019s pretty straightforward, all things considered.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Fire at Sea", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "This Italian documentary is the official submission from that country for the next Academy Awards. The reaction to this from certain Italian fiction filmmakers has been not unlike the consternation certain novelists have expressed about Bob Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. But, Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s soreness notwithstanding, this is a pertinent gesture, one of self-criticism, even. For \u201cFire at Sea,\u201d in a sense, chronicles an Italian failure. An Italian failure that is, arguably, shared by the rest of the Western world. Advertisement Lampedusa is, per Wikipedia, the largest island of the Pelagie Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. Its closeness to Libya makes it a relatively desirable landing point for African and North African refugees fleeing from wars, unrest, and starvation on that continent. \u201cRelatively\u201d desirable because, as the movie shows in patiently unfolded detail, there\u2019s really very little upside to being a refugee.  Directed by Gianfranco Rosi, the movie begins with a text that reels off some numbers: 400,000 migrants, 15,000 deaths. Such big numbers are hard to see as anything but abstractions. Rosi then cuts to some beautiful, peaceful imagery. Giant radio antennas revolve in front of a dramatic sky full of grey clouds over an undulating sea. A radio DJ says some calming words. It doesn\u2019t seem like a deadly environment.  The movie doesn\u2019t use any narration; the opening text is all the hand-holding the viewer gets. Rosi instead homes his camera on narratives pertaining at first to the natives of the island. A compassionate doctor is seen treating patients who clearly aren\u2019t locals. He bemoans the indignities they suffer, and their deaths. A young boy, a neighbor of the doctor, makes slingshots using medical rubber bands and takes them to a local field to shoot with his pals. Soon there are shots of choppers and a boat. The latest batch of migrants is here.  \u201cThey\u2019re drenched in diesel,\u201d one coastal patrol worker says, examining a few people who have come off a boat. \u201cIf I flicked a cigarette lighter in here the whole room would go up.\u201d The underfed migrants, who mostly look down at their feet as they meet the people into whose hands they\u2019ve placed their fates, grow voluble after a while. In a holding cell, one of them speak-sings of his journey here, from Nigeria. \u201cWe drank our piss to survive,\u201d he wails, both proud and miserable. The doctor continues treating these folks, one by one. The young boy, Samuele, is diagnosed with lazy eye and wanders around with an eyepatch. The sea is always there, ready to deliver new shipments of humanity. Advertisement Rosi\u2019s film is thoughtful and well-constructed. It doesn\u2019t strive for the epic feel of Visconti\u2019s \u201cLa terra trema,\u201d the 1948 epic about Sicilian fisherman that\u2019s been an inescapable influence on Italian film. Its intimacy is a boon. But as laudable as the movie is, it does not quite achieve greatness. That\u2019s the fault of both its indirectness and its obviousness. The portrayals of life in Lampedusa that don\u2019t touch on the migrant crisis have a distance from the subject matter that seems a little besides the point at times. As for obviousness, there\u2019s a scene in which Samuele and his friend are in a field using their new slingshots to shoot projectiles at cactus plants. After doing considerable damage to one of the plants, Samuele tries to make up for it by putting a mutilated plant back together using electrical tape. As they used to say in The New Yorker, \u201cblock that metaphor!\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Dark Tower", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\u201cThe man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\u201d With that great opening line, an obsession began for millions of readers of Stephen King\u2019s series of books that would eventually be known as The Dark Tower. The first book was actually called The Gunslinger, and it was a relatively small volume of brilliant sci-fi/fantasy that used iconic imagery to begin the crafting of a world that would become as rich as those created by George R. R. Martin or J.R.R Tolkien. Over the next few books\u2014The Drawing of the Three, The Wastelands, and Wizard and Glass\u2014King did some of his best writing (the series would actually stretch to seven books and a series of comics, but it\u2019s the initial quartet that holds a special place in my heart). I only mention all of this to place the failure of the long-delayed \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d in the right perspective: this isn\u2019t just a mediocre movie\u2014although it is most definitely that\u2014it is a wasted opportunity to fulfill the promise of that opening line from 35 years ago.  Advertisement Plagued by reshoots and dogged by rumors of poor test screenings, \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d once looked like it would be one of the more notable failures of 2017. Honestly, I kind of wish it was. As is, it\u2019s more forgettable than loathsome, the kind of movie that occasionally rubs salt in your wounds by reminding you what could have been, but mostly just dissipates from memory as it's playing. The two leads here\u2014Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey\u2014work just fine in these iconic roles, and you just want to pick them up and put them in a better movie, one that doesn\u2019t seem stuck in the valley between trying to satisfy hardcore fans of the series and the moviegoers who have never heard of Roland and Walter. By trying to do both, the movie ends up doing neither. The problems start immediately. Someone probably thought that making Roland, the title character of the first book, the lead of the first film wouldn\u2019t satisfy a wide enough demographic. And Hollywood is obsessed with stories of teenagers who discover their bad dreams or hidden secrets are actually the keys to the salvation of the universe. So, instead of the origin story of Roland (which will apparently now be told in a television series, also starring Elba), our protagonist here is really Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor), an essential character in the books reimagined here as a troubled New York teen without much of a real personality. As with almost everyone in this film, he\u2019s a device, a way to push the exposition forward to meet a contractually-mandated running time.  Here\u2019s what we learn about the movie version of Jake, who is basically like the kid reading \"The Neverending Story\" in that he constantly tries to explain to the audience what's going on. Jake has prophetic visions of both the Gunslinger Roland (Elba) and the Man in Black Walter (McConaughey). He also has visions of a massive tower, which we learn is basically keeping the order of the universe. Walter wants to destroy this tower, and he knows that there\u2019s a child out there with the power to help him do so. Of course, that child is Jake, who it turns out has the same power as the young man at the center of \u201cThe Shining.\u201d He can read minds and other such things that Walter will harness to blow up the tower. \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d is filled with references for King nuts, including, among others, a moment where Roland glances behind a pin-up poster while looking for an exit (\u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d) and the numbers \u201c1408\u201d above a portal. Did I mention the portals? I got distracted. It\u2019s easy to do so with this movie. Advertisement Roland, Walter, and eventually Jake cross between worlds through portals. It\u2019s not long before Jake and Roland team up, but Jake questions whether or not his new gun-toting pal is going to help him save the tower or if he just wants vengeance against the man in black. A few other characters flit around the fringe of this thin piece of storytelling, but it\u2019s essentially a three-character piece. And two of those characters are actually pretty well defined. Elba brings a nice gravity to Roland that fits the character well, a combination of a man haunted by the ghosts of his past and driven to do what\u2019s right to avenge them. And McConaughey dances on the edge of hamming it up in the villain role, reining it in just enough that one can see how well he could have been utilized with a better script and vision for the project. Because that\u2019s where this tower crumbles. \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d is hollow. It is soulless. It is a film that never quite figured out what it wanted to be, and so elected to be nothing much at all. Worst of all, it\u2019s clearly been chopped up by those reported reshoots and test screening edits. There\u2019s a scene with a demon in a house that just ends and much of the final act material features a Jake who looks a lot closer to puberty than when the movie began. Weird humorous bits feel like they have been spliced in, trying to find as big an audience as possible. And while some may criticize Stephen King\u2019s more populist works, that\u2019s a charge that could never be lobbied at The Dark Tower. These books had vision. They created worlds. They used iconic imagery to explore timeless themes. \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d plays it so safe and takes so few risks that its greatest sin is in being the one thing those formative books never were for so many people: forgettable.", "Critic": "Beta"}

{"Title": "Mr. Peabody & Sherman", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "I'm not convinced that the world really needed a big budget, 3-D, feature-length reboot of the adventures of Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman, but here it is. \u00a0It's better than OK, and a few elements sing; but overall it frustrates. Its delights come from its willingness to depart from formula, but formula still rules it.  The picture is based on the classic Jay Ward shorts that used to appear on Rocky and Bullwinkle's animated variety show, back during TV's late jurassic period. The film's director Rob Minkoff (\"The Lion King\") and his screenwriter Craig Wright (\"Lost\") don't knock themselves out trying to replicate every nuance. They've kept the central relationship between a genius dog (Ty Burrell) and his adopted human son (Max Charles), plus the time machine they travel in, and a few of Mr. Peabody's brazenly horrible puns (at one point the pooch tells his boy that Egypt's pyramids were designed by \"some old Giza\"). Everything else, though, has been ginned up, seemingly to bring \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" in line with American studio animation's unofficial house style. I'm referring to a familiar set of qualities developed during the Disney renaissance of the late '80s and early '90s, and perfected, if that is the word, by the \"Shrek\" series, and movies in a \"Shrek\"-like vein. Advertisement On Ward's series, the draughtsmanship was simple, and the characters were so barely-animated that they seemed to slide across the screen, like figures in a pop-up book. This movie, in contrast, goes for the glitzy, the state-of-the-art. The designs are highly stylized, but with incongruous elements. The realistic shadings and blockbuster action-film-style (virtual) camerawork seem at odds with the movie's Eisenhower-Kennedy era cars, clothes, hairstyles and architecture; ditto the characters with their Ward-style bobble-heads and sticklike bodies and arms. When Danny Elfman's sprightly-bombastic score swells and Mr. Peabody and Sherman zoom through snaky time-space wormholes a la \"Star Trek\" or \"Contact,\" or race out of a collapsing tomb, or body surf through a network of sewer tunnels just ahead of raging flood waters or flame-clouds, it's as if rather slight source material had been injected with a hyper-dose of steroids that made it balloon grotesquely, creating bulges where bulges shouldn't be.\u00a0 The humor seems off as well. The original show had a distinctively goofy and wry sensibility. It mixed historical factoids and Borscht Belt tomfoolery, with Mr. Peabody educating his boy Sherman on the culture and history of whatever society they happened to be disrupting, then getting them out of jams via Sherlock Holmes-style displays of icy super-competence. There's a fair bit of that in here, and it's marvelous. Peabody's math-driven approach to travel and escape is visualized with onscreen graphics, arrows and equations, and\u00a0the name of Mr. Peabody's fancy mixed drink \"Einstein on the Beach\" is funny on at least two levels. It's hard to imagine how Ty Burrell's vocal performance as Peabody could be improved. Everything about it is exquisitely judged, from the way he sprints through Peabody's scientific exposition, but never so quickly that he confuses the viewer, to the way he unveils the dog's wretched puns (in Peabody's mind, he's underplaying the jokes, but to anyone listening, he's hammering them).\u00a0 Considering that the movie's\u00a0subtlest achievements are its most impressive, it's too bad that \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" felt obligated to be \"awesome\" every single second. \u00a0As \"The Lego Movie\" taught us, \"awesome\" has become a code word that means, \"Let's collectively agree to pretend this isn't the same old thing we always experience, so that we don't feel sad and cheated.\"\u00a0The problem isn't that the film is badly executed (by every current industry yardstick, it's aces) but that the filmmakers have taken something uncategorizable and revised in ways that make it more like everything else in multiplexes. The noise and scale mean that Ward's characters have to fight to seem charming and special, even though in quiet scenes you never question their charming specialness. \u00a0 Advertisement The film also displays a puzzling tone-deafness towards other eras and cultures, and towards women and girls. An early action sequence set in Egypt is visually splendid and has an agreeable \"History of the World, Part 1\" silliness (Mel Brooks makes the connection official with a vocal cameo later in the film, as Sigmund Freud). It's capped by a magnificently absurd routine in which the hero impersonates a god. But this same sequence trades in white-girl-imperiled-by-creepy-brown-men images. It also digs the film deeper into a sexist pit that I hoped it wouldn't fall into, even though the warning signs appear early. Sherman's classmate and academic rival Penny Peterson (Ariel Winter) is nothing more than a grade-school version of Tracy Flick from \"Election,\" prideful and spiteful and shallow where Sherman is humble, considerate and soulful. \u00a0When she goes to Peabody and Sherman's house with her parents, she becomes an even more irritating character, losing the grating competitiveness that made her dynamic as well as unlikable. She manipulates Peabody into showing her Sherman's time machine (against daddy dog's instructions) then gets kidnapped by the boy version of King Tut, mesmerized by his wealth, lured into marriage and prepped for sacrifice. She's just another annoying, self-involved chick causing problems for a lovable dude.\u00a0 This is par for the gender-relations course in \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman.\" None of the other women in the movie\u2014including Penny's mom (voiced by Leslie Mann) and the plump spinster guidance counselor Miss Grunion (Allison Janney)\u2014rise above mere shrew or foil. A sequence set in Egypt that finds Peabody, Sherman and Penny cavorting with Leonardo DaVinci (Stanley Tucci) makes the film's subordination of women official. Penny launches Leonardo's flying machine (against Sherman's wishes; notice the pattern?), but rather than revel in her ability to make action happen, the sequence has Penny turn over the mechanical bird's controls to Sherman, whom she delightedly describes as the first man ever to take flight. Advertisement The film's attempts to create \"heart\" are problematic, too, though understandable. Over the past 25 years, Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks and pretty much every other studio that makes animated films have made us expect a blend of slapstick, buddy comedy and overscaled action, and maybe a song or two if it's a musical, with a bit of hugging and learning, all wrapped up in a heart-shaped bow. \u00a0The filmmakers might have worried that they couldn't sustain a Jay Ward-style cool farce for 75 minutes, even an animated one\u2014that viewers of all ages, conditioned by so many other animated pictures, would demand that their heartstrings be tugged regularly.\u00a0Thus Peabody and Sherman's relationship, which remained largely unexplained in the TV series and was more amusing for being undefined, is here transformed into a half-baked parable of social difference, with Peabody, the dog raising an orphaned human, perhaps standing in for a single or gay or unacceptably metrosexual dad, or maybe an adoptive parent of a different race. (In a flashback sequence, an African-American judge, voiced by Dennis Haysbert, grants Peabody custody of the foundling child.)\u00a0 If the movie had gone all the way with this notion and converted subtext into text, it might have distinguished itself as a total re-imagining of its source, rather than a mildly eccentric version of the same-old, same-old. It's a bit of a shame, really. \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" is a sweet movie, funny and essentially decent. But its failure to avoid the imaginative failures and regressive messages that plague so many other feature-length cartoons make it more disappointing, somehow, than more crass, mechanical film might have been. The eccentric touches give you hope for the movie. The movie dashes them.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Dolphin Tale 2", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Dolphin Tale\" told the extraordinary true story of Winter, a dolphin with an injured tail, saved by the groundbreaking use of a flexible prosthetic tail built to the contours of her body. The tail allowed her to continue to flourish at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, whose dedicated team of marine biologists and animal rescue specialists devote their lives to helping injured marine life. Director Charles Martin Smith told Winter's story with respect, warmth and care, soft-pedaling any impulse towards anthropomorphism. A sequel might seem unnecessary (except for the fact that \"Dolphin Tale\" was such a huge hit.) But Smith, who directed and wrote \"Dolphin Tale 2\", has assembled the same cast of characters (including the actual Winter, who plays herself in both movies), and has created another sensitive and well-observed story about life in the marina, human and animal. The strengths of the first film are here as well. \"Dolphin Tale 2\" cares about the right things: the details of marine rescue, the dedication of the individuals involved, and the lives and personalities of the animals under their care. \"Dolphin Tale 2\" tries to do too much, with too many stories shoehorned in, but the overall effect is emotional and sweet. Advertisement Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick, Jr.) started the Clearwater Marine Aquarium with the motto: \"Rescue. Rehab. Release.\" Winter's success story helped make CMA famous and profitable, which we now see, in \"Dolphin Tale 2\" is a blessing and a curse. Winter is big business for the marina and financial decisions start to override the health and well-being of the animals. Sawyer (Nathan Gamble), the young shy boy who bonded with Winter in the first film, is now a teenager, and trains the volunteer staff at the marina. His bond with Winter has helped him understand what he wants to do with his life. Clay's daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) works at the marina too, and she and Sawyer are still good friends, but maybe puberty has brought something else to the surface. Kris Kristofferson returns as Dr. Clay's father, Ashley Judd as Sawyer's mother, and Morgan Freeman as the thinking-outside-of-the-box prosthetic limb designer, Dr. Cameron McCarthy. Even the feisty obnoxious pelican Rufus has returned, still terrorizing the visitors to the marina. (At the screening I went to, populated mostly by children under the age of 10, Rufus was a huge hit.) Winter is in trouble again. Her companion dolphin died of old age. Dolphins are social animals and it is against USDA regulation to have a dolphin alone in a tank. Dr. Clay is written up for a violation. An injured baby dolphin, found stranded and sunburned on a sandbar, has been brought to the marina, and the hope is that she can be introduced to Winter's tank. Will Winter accept her? Will the baby dolphin be freaked out by the prosthetic? If the \"introduction\" doesn't go well, then Winter's future is in jeopardy. She may die, or be moved to another facility. The financial investors in the marina put pressure on Dr. Clay to make this friendship between dolphins happen, because Winter is a cash cow. But Winter is under no obligation to comply with the ridiculous needs of humans. If she doesn't like the baby interloper, she doesn't like her. There are other issues to consider: If the baby dolphin recovers completely, then Dr. Clay has an obligation to release her back into the wild. But then what will happen to Winter? Is it time to let Winter go? There are other animals in recovery at the marina, one being a giant yellow sea turtle, found caught in someone's tossed-away fishing line. This is a lot of plot. For the most part, Smith guides us through it simply, letting the heightened emotions take care of themselves. Like the first film, he resists making the animals seem like cuddly stuffed animals with human emotions. Dolphins are highly sophisticated creatures but, as Dr. Clay says to Sawyer and Hazel at one point, \"Winter is not a pet. She's a wild animal.\" \"Dolphin Tale 2\" treats Winter (and all of the other animals we meet) with respect. She is her own thing, she has emotions and thoughts, as all animals do, but they cannot be explained to us, they cannot be revealed. Sawyer is a trusted human in Winter's world. She tweets and beeps at him when she sees him, but still, when she's having a bad day, she won't hesitate to thrash about, knocking him across the face with her hard bottle nose. Advertisement \"Dolphin Tale 2\" works because it immerses us fully in the daily rhythms of the marina. It shows us how things work, down to the most nuts-and-bolts level. Introducing a new dolphin into a tank with another dolphin is almost as elaborate a production as an opera at the Met. It requires all hands on deck. By focusing on the details, Smith helps us understand not only what is happening but the emotional stakes as well. This is no small feat. Schmaltz would be an error with such inherently strong material, and Smith knows it. There are scenes showing the release process, beautifully shot by cinematographer Daryn Okada, where a fully-recovered animal is set free into the Gulf Coast again. People gather on the beach to watch, holding up supportive signs (as though the animals will find strength in reading them), and there are cheers of triumph when a dolphin is seen joining a school out at sea. The score, by Rachel Portman, is elegant and supportive, rather than intrusive and bossy. Harry Connick Jr., as Dr. Clay, is troubled and thoughtful, and also a good leader. There is no doubt who is in charge. On the night the baby dolphin is brought to the marina, via ambulance, he shouts to the crowd of volunteers, \"When that dolphin comes out of the van, the only voice I want to hear is my own.\"\u00a0 It's a very good performance. Nathan Gamble is beautiful in his role, heartbroken that Winter seems to be declining. He is supposed to start looking at colleges but how can he leave Winter?

He does not speak and there is no voice-over narration, so we cannot know what's in his head. But the movie is contemplating, among other things, the fleeting nature of existence\u2014the way that time, to quote \"Life Itself,\" slips through your fingers like a long silk scarf.\u00a0 \"Boyhood\" became the instant subject of media buzz last year when Linklater revealed that he'd been working on the project for 12 years, following the same actors (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as the hero's parents, Olivia and Mason, Sr., and the director's daughter Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha) through the early part of the 21st century. We watch the children grow up and the adults thicken and grey. We see Olivia and Mason, Sr. in various relationships. Olivia is looking to replace her ex-husband and make her \"broken\" family intact again, and this search leads her into a series of arrangements that are wrong for her, sometimes horribly so. Mason, Sr., goes the other way, acting the role of bohemian free-spirit even as he works a series of rather typical jobs. The kids get taller and become interested in particular subjects, and in sex, and after a while they start to think about college and what they want to do with their lives.\u00a0 Advertisement It's all a blur. The blur is indescribably moving. We've seen people age in movies and on TV programs\u2014the kids in the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Up\" series, for instance, and little Ronny Howard on \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" and Kiernan Shipka on \"Mad Men\"\u2014but we've never seen it happen in such a compact span of screen time. That's what makes \"Boyhood\" singular. There is no other work to which one can directly compare it without distorting pop culture history. This movie is truly its own thing, as eccentrically unique as Linklater's breakthrough \"Slacker,\" another Austin-set feature to which \"Boyhood\" feels (curiously) like a companion piece, or perhaps a bookend. Mason is a child of divorce. He and his mother and his sister move around a lot, all over Texas, a U.S. state as big as France. Mason's dad does not have custody, so has to accommodate his wife's shifts in geography over the years, sometimes driving hundreds of miles to see his children. \u00a0Even though Olivia and Mason, Jr. love their kids, there are moments when they resent them, because once they had them they were locked into a particular track and had to put their kids first, always. The trick, though\u2014and this is where Linklater the writer shows how generous and kind he is\u2014lies in realizing that sometimes when parents think they're putting their kids first they're really responding to conditioning, or doing what their society or their gender or their parents told them was the correct thing to do. The movie's about social conditioning as well as time. It asks basic, deep questions. What makes us \"normal\"? Is there such a thing as \"normal\"? What makes us identify as men, as women, as children? Is the traditional domestic arrangement\u2014a wife, a husband and kids living in the same house\u2014really desirable for every person, and genuinely good for society, or does it inflict distress on those whose personalities and desires cannot function within it? Two important men in Olivia's life have drinking problems; alcoholism is a disease, but it's also a means of forgetting, of numbing pain, of denial. \u00a0Do we really change over time? Can we decide to change ourselves? Or is free will an illusion? \u00a0Do we seize moments or do moments seize us? (\"You are responsible for your own actions,\" warns a sign hanging in the hero's elementary school.)\u00a0 Advertisement Olivia seems, like many single moms, dispirited by the the responsibilities she bears. Early on we hear her arguing with her boyfriend, a single man who resents that she can't just come and go as she pleases, as he does. (\"I was somebody's daughter, and then I was somebody's fucking mother,\" she says.) She's chasing an idea of normalcy that may not be right for her. In an intense scene that occurs in a car outside of a school, not long after a period of domestic strife, Olivia asks for understanding because she's trying to build \"a family\" with a new boyfriend, and Mason exclaims, \"We already have a family!\"\u2014and he's right. Olivia is a college professor and a liberal feminist, but she's still bought into the husband-and-wife-and-two-kids-equals-a-real-family thing. She studies \"unconditioned response\" in one of her grad school courses but it takes a few years for her to figure out, in practical terms, what the phrase means. There are points near the end of \"Boyhood\" when\u00a0Olivia might remind you of George Bailey, the hero of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" Of the movie's two parents, she is nearly always the responsible one\u2014the \"boring\" one. Even her worst decisions were made for noble reasons, but the constraints that motherhood placed on her freedom always gnawed at her. Over time, though, she grows by leaps and bounds, finishing grad school and becoming a teacher and then a person of considerable influence in her community. We start to see the profound, lasting impact that her moral rectitude has had on the world. She evolves, as surely as her ex-husband and children evolve, but the process is subtler. It's not right out there, like her ex-husband's delayed maturation. The film's title and choice of protagonist have been criticized (gently but firmly) for unthinkingly confirming that heterosexual men are at the center of the universe. But this reading ignores the movie's constant (if empathetic) critique of American manhood, or what passes for American manhood: an entitled mental state that is really just boyhood with money and a driver's license. Mason, Sr., for all the love that he shows his kids, is an example of this. He's a great natural playmate for his son and daughter, joining them on the floor as they futz with toys and taking them on camping trips and trying to purchase their love with gifts as if every visitation were a miniature Christmas. But he doesn't express much real wisdom until his kids edge toward adolescence and become tight-lipped and undemonstrative, and he pulls the car over during a family trip to demand that they have real conversations (amusingly, Samantha makes the same request of him). \u00a0 Advertisement He has to learn to give in as well as to give\u2014and that giving in doesn't always have to mean giving up.\u00a0Even when Mason, Sr. is 30 or 40 he still lives like a 19-year old who just got his first place. He resents his ex-wife as a killjoy, and clings to his GTO the way little boys cling to their loveys. And yet\u00a0he matures onscreen along with his kids, mellowing over the years and becoming less strident and arrogant and more generous, learning that it's possible to be a person of integrity even if you aren't insisting that every single thing go your way at every single moment (a pattern of behavior that only narcissists mistake for freedom).\u00a0We get the sense that in some ways Mason the elder is un-learning what he learned during the first part of his life\u2014an experience that his kids are now going through, with different details. It's rough, this process. It's emotional boot camp, with versions of hazing. And I love how \"Boyhood\" admits that, in certain ways, growing up stinks. Every character has a least one moment in which they have to heed the advice of Corinthians and put away childish things. None of them like it. The adults in Mason, Jr.'s orbit (including his mother and father and various teachers and authority figures) all want to parent or mentor him by turning him into reflections or extensions of themselves. In high school, a photography teacher tells the budding shutterbug hero that he needs to move away from arty compositions and learn to shoot sports so that he can make a living, advice which assumes that Mason, Jr. wants to earn a living with photography rather than treating it as an avocation, or as the visual version of a diary. The manager of a restaurant where Mason, Jr. works as a dishwasher wants to groom him as a fry cook. The man's eyes light up as he describes this arc, as if he's moved by his own generosity. At various points during the boy's life he's pushed toward bad decisions by other boys who warn him that failure to act a certain way makes him a \"fag\" or a \"pussy.\" You sense the kid pushing back against these pressures. You realize that, for all their faults, and despite the geographical and emotional obstacles that they were up against, his parents did a good job raising him. Or maybe he absorbed their better qualities as if by osmosis. (Did he seize their better qualities, or did their better qualities seize him?) Linklater doesn't explain any of this\u2014the storytelling and filmmaking are intuitive; things that look like pointers or labels aren't\u2014and yet it's all there in the movie. You can feel it. Perhaps without meaning to, the film exemplifies the best piece of advice that anyone gives the hero: \"We're all just winging it.\" Advertisement \"Boyhood\" is broken into discrete dramatic chunks\u2014this is really an anthology of short movies with a recurring cast\u2014and there are no timestamps telling us that we've passed from 2002 into 2003 or from 2009 into 2010. We realize where we are on the timeline when we hear somebody talking about the Iraq war, or hear a song on the soundtrack that was big during a certain year, or realize that the boy has changed his haircut or gotten a little bit taller. The simultaneously nourishing and corrosive effects of time make the film quietly moving and humble-seeming, despite its three-hour length and conceptual audacity. Time is what makes the film cohere even when particular scenes, images or performances seem clunky or undernourished. Fixating on imperfections while discussing \"Boyhood\" would be as petty as criticizing the sculpting of individual stones in a cathedral.\u00a0The totality matters. Even more important is our recognition that the totality is as fleeting as life.\u00a0 Time, and our interaction with time, and the way in which we are all ultimately overmatched and worn down by time, and the notion of cinema as a means of sculpting with time: these and other aspects of temporality are at the heart of \"Boyhood.\" Time is the core around which all of this movie's musings on childhood and parenthood are woven. It's the river down which the scenes and characters travel without consciously realizing that they are on individual journeys that all have the same ending. If life is \"about\" anything, it's about realizing and accepting that fact: that everything is fleeting. Time gives birth and nourishes and then obliterates as it moves ahead, like the family which, in an early scene, prepares to move out of a house by covering murals and hand-lettered height charts with white paint. The film ends and the credits come up and you ask the same question that you ask at the end of an evening spent with old, dear friends: where did the time go?", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Prisoners", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Kidnapping thrillers often lull us into a sense of safety in the opening sequences, showing the normal rhythms of life that will soon be shattered. Denis Villeneuve's \"Prisoners\" does not go that route. It opens with a shot of a snowy forest, where a deer quietly noses around for food. Into the frame comes the barrel of a shotgun. We hear a prayer being intoned. Boom, the deer goes down.\u00a0The camera pulls back to show a father (Hugh Jackman) and teenage son (Dylan Minnette), in day-glo hunting gear staring at their kill through the ranks of bare trees. On the drive home, the father, who seems humorless, intense, and a bit of a bore, lectures the son on how to always be prepared for the worst in life.\u00a0 Advertisement This opening is so heavy-handed that it's amazing that the film doesn't instantly collapse under its symbolic weight. Shot by the great Roger Deakins, regular cinematographer for the Coen brothers, the movie is drenched in rain and drained of color. Aspects of \"Prisoners\" are effective, but for the most part it's rather ridiculous (despite the fact that it clearly wants to be taken super-seriously), and there's an overwrought quality to much of the acting. Keller Dover (Jackman) is an independent contractor who lives with his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and two kids in a suburban neighborhood. He loves Bruce Springsteen, \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" hunting, and hoarding canned goods, gas masks, and survivalist gadgets in his basement. On Thanksgiving, the Dovers go to dinner with a neighboring family, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis), who have two kids the same age. While the parents drink wine and talk in the living room, the two little girls ask if they can take a walk. It is a walk from which they do not return. Panic ensues, especially when it becomes clear that a creepy RV, which had been seen parked in the neighborhood earlier, has vanished. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case. The RV's owner, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), is dragged in for questioning. Forensics say the RV is clean of physical evidence, but Alex is strange. he speaks in a whispery high voice that makes him sound like a pre-teen. It is not inconceivable to think that he may be hiding something. This is clearly Dover's take, and he and Loki immediately start to butt heads about the course of the investigation. When Jones is released due to lack of evidence (into the custody of his aunt, played by Melissa Leo), Dover takes matters into his own hands, kidnapping Jones, and holding him hostage in an abandoned dilapidated building. Dover loops in Franklin Birch on his plan to beat the truth out of Jones. Birch is horrified at the sight of Jones tied to a sink, but he ignores his own moral compass in the face of Dover's furious certainty. This is one of the subtler points of the script: how certainty can override doubt with sheer force, and how doubt is often essential to maintaining our humanity. \u00a0 Hugh Jackman huffs and puffs and screams and roars throughout the film, and it becomes monotonous, but what all that behavior tells us is that this is a weak man who needs to feel powerful. In one telling moment, while murmuring the \"Our Father,\" he is unable to say \"as we forgive those who trespass against us.\" He has a veritable arsenal in his basement, his family could withstand a mustard gas attack as well as the Zombie Apocalypse, but he couldn't protect his daughter on a simple walk through a safe neighborhood. And he's so convinced that Alex Jones is the guy that he is blind to other possibilities. Meanwhile, his wife lies in bed, tranquilizing herself into a stupor. Advertisement Gyllenhaal is great here in a role that must have looked rather uninteresting on the page.\u00a0Aaron Guzikowski's script, so packed with religious symbols that verges on a sermon, is excellent in its spare and compelling portrait of Loki. The only image of the character outside the context of his job is his introductory scene, eating Thanksgiving dinner in an empty, fluorescent-lit Chinese restaurant as the rain batters down outside. The only thing we learn about his past is that he was in a boys' home and was raised in foster care. His knuckles and neck are sprinkled with tattoos, including a cross on one thumb. He's got a facial tic. We meet a lot of creeps in \"Prisoners\", and you get the sense that Detective Loki could have been one of them if he hadn't become a cop. It's a nice performance from Gyllenhaal, and its subtlety is welcome considering all the teeth gnashing going on in other performances. Director Villeneuve gives us a couple of truly suspenseful scenes. One is a chase through the nighttime back yards of the neighborhood after a candlelight vigil for the two girls. The interiors of the houses seem gloomy and cramped, with walls cutting into the frame and characters coming in and out of sight: a visual correlative for the idea of people cut off from one another. But as the plot goes into high gear and we get other suspects, basement lairs and a glimpse of vast conspiracies, \"Prisoners\" wears out its welcome.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Gimme Shelter", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Gimme Shelter\" starts with a lot of promise. We see shots of a gritty New York not often seen in films today: rattling above-ground subway lines, tenements, dank hallways filled with noise and chaos. Over the urban landscape shots, we hear a whispering female voice, \"I'm not scared. I can do this. I'm okay.\" Vanessa Hudgens, fully separated now from her \"High School Musical\" persona, having taken gritty almost feral roles in \"Sucker Punch,\" \"Spring Breakers,\" and \"Frozen Ground\", stands in a cramped bathroom, chopping off her black hair, whispering those words to herself. Her words will come up again as her character, Apple, makes a run for it, out of the life handed to her, into a life she created. Advertisement \"Gimme Shelter\" has an episodic structure that gives a monotonous \"and then this happened, and then this happened\" feel to all of the hardships that Apple encounters. There are car crashes and locked shelter doors, uncomprehending social workers and screaming families. Father McCarthy, a\u00a0kindly priest played by James Earl Jones, hovers around Apple, shining his benign light.\u00a0 Based on a true story, \"Gimme Shelter\" ultimately is about the work of Kathy DiFiore, who created Christian shelters for pregnant teens who want to keep their babies. The scenes of Apple in the shelter all the other pregnant girls are the film's best, but the shelter doesn't appear until halfway through, Krauss having decided for some reason to hold it back. What this does is it makes the shelter seem like a sub-plot, or another \"and then this happened\" episode, when it is actually the point of the whole thing.  Aside from James Earl Jones and a baffled and uptight Brendan Fraser, Vanessa Hudgens is the only \"name\" in the film. She is in every scene. She carries the action. Like the famous \"women's pictures\" in the 1940s, \"Gimme Shelter\" is interested in the up-and-down journey of its lead female character: her struggles and triumphs, failures and flaws. Every detail here is right. The piercings on Apple's nose and lips look infected, her skin is blotched and pimply, and when she gets a chance to eat, she shovels the food in her mouth like a wild animal. Apple has been \"in the system\" since her earliest days, she has been abused and raped and molested, and the \"system\" kept shoving her back into the pit. Her mother, played by an almost-unrecognizable Rosario Dawson, was \"born in the streets\", she has rotting yellow teeth, bruises on her legs. The \"system\" keeps trying to re-unite Apple with her mother, against Apple's clear wishes. But Apple is still a minor.  In the opening scenes of the film, Apple escapes from her mother's clutches and makes her way to New Jersey to track down the man who is her biological father (Brendan Fraser), a man she has never met. The man now lives in a Daddy Warbucks-level mansion with his wife (Stephanie Szostak) and two kids, and they try to adjust to the advent of Apple, who is rude and sullen, with atrocious table manners. When it becomes obvious that Apple is pregnant, Mrs. Daddy Warbucks takes her to a clinic to get an abortion. Apple stares at the ultrasound pictures, deciding whether she wants to keep the baby. She needs shelter, of course. Advertisement Kathy DiFiore is a character in the film. She's played by Ann Dowd, in a powerful and compassionate performance that doesn't look like acting. She seems like a real person. \u00a0She has a sense of mission towards the unborn babies under her care, as well as to the girls who live in her house. The girls in these scenes are wonderful, anonymous, they seem to have stepped right off the streets. Their interactions feel improvisational and fresh.While there is some bickering, none of it gets too harsh. For the most part it is a supportive family atmosphere.\u00a0 The couple of scenes between Dawson and Hudgens vibrate with pain and ugliness. The script is often obvious, with all feelings laid out too cleanly, but both actresses still manage to create a jagged relationship based on their characters' codependence and shared traumas. One of the film's strengths is its portrayal of the \"system\" and what it does to abused children, and the layers of bureaucracy that make it hard to bring about meaningful change in people's lives.  There's a reason the Christian media has been following this film closely. The religious aspect of \"Gimme Shelter\" is right out on the table, once the kindly priest shows up, but it's undercut by the grubby and warm reality of those girls in the shelter. There are some scenes where the girls grumble to one another at being made to collect donations in local churches, and be trotted out as success stories of living in the light of Jesus. The film never says the words \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice.\" It genuinely seems to be about how the system has broken down entirely, and how sometimes it is up to privately funded charities to provide a light at the end of the tunnel.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Biography cannot explain talent. Knowing a person's childhood details and early life may be interesting, but it does not (and cannot) illuminate the talent itself. Some piece will always be missing.\u00a0This seems to be the attitude that Sophie Huber has taken in her meditative documentary, \"Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction,\" about the great American actor.\u00a0 Stanton is 86 years old. He is still working. He has been in over 200 films, and even he doesn't know the exact number. He was born in Kentucky. Beyond that, we don't get much from him. He fought in the Battle of Okinawa. He was maybe married for two weeks once, he's not sure now. Sophie Huber is faced with a wall of gentle resistance to her questions. Advertisement And yet, as he does in his roles, Stanton opens himself up to the camera in a way that has the indelible stamp of truth, an almost fragile sense of honesty. At one point, in his car, he says to Huber off-camera, \"I don't want any lines. How 'bout doing nothing? How 'bout silence?\" Although the film is filled with talk and music, it is the silence that opens up our understanding. Rainer Maria Rilke wrote, \u201cDo not now seek the answers... Live the questions now...\u201d Harry Dean Stanton, reserved, elusive, carries around his solitude with him wherever he goes. He is a man who \"lives the questions\". The answers are irrelevant\u2014to Stanton, and to this film. Harry Dean Stanton: Party Fiction\" takes a dreamy and philosophical approach, reflecting the personality of the man who is its subject. It is partly a day-in-the-life-of-Harry-Dean.\u00a0We drive around the empty night streets of Los Angeles with him, we go hang out at a bar on Santa Monica Boulevard, where he has been a regular for 40 years. There are brief but fascinating interviews with colleagues and friends, Wim Wenders, Sam Shepard, Kris Kristofferson, Debbie Harry. There's a wonderful scene where David Lynch reads questions to Stanton about his life from a piece of paper. Clips from Stanton's movies are, surprisingly, few and far between, and seem relegated to the films discussed by those interviewed.\u00a0 Interspersed throughout is footage of present-day Harry Dean Stanton sitting in his Los Angeles home, singing the songs that he loves, country-western tunes, Mexican songs, \"Danny Boy\". When he sings, he is lost to everything but the music. In an illuminating moment later with Kristofferson, Stanton expresses regret that he didn't pursue singing seriously. At first, it seems that the songs are there to add nuance to our image of Stanton, but by the end, we've heard him sing five or six songs in total, and Huber clearly finds Stanton's love of music and his openness while singing a key that accesses us to Stanton's inner world. Advertisement Stanton had been working for 30 years as a character actor before he got his first lead role, as the man who appears from out of the desert in Wim Wenders' \"Paris, Texas\". He usually plays outsiders, loners, drifters: men on the outskirts of the cultural norm. His one brief scene in Monte Hellman's \"Two-Lane Blacktop\", as the lonely gay hitchhiker who puts a hand on Warren Oates' knee, is tragic, and he has less than five minutes to establish an entire story for his character. But that is just one example from hundreds. David Lynch speaks of Stanton's \"innocence\", which remains intact despite his age and experience. Perhaps his career of playing outsiders is partly an accident of genetics: his face is one of the most memorable in cinema, etched with lines and deep crevices. Sam Shepard says, \"He's one of those actors who knows that his face is the story.\" Stanton's eyes always seem to be looking at a horizon, either actual or interior. He is powerfully elsewhere. Pain wells up in him easily, coming in a breath, a pause. He does his work simply, with no fanfare. To quote Katharine Hepburn on John Wayne: \"He is a very very good actor in the most highbrow sense of the word. You don\u2019t catch him at it.\"  Stanton admits that he has always been \"a loner\", and yet he has maintained friendships over the course of his life. He and Jack Nicholson are very close. Stanton tells of his friendship with Marlon Brando, the long phone calls they would have in the last three years of Brando's life. Stanton has no sense of self-importance, or awareness of his status. When David Lynch asks Stanton how he would like to be remembered, Stanton replies, \"It doesn't matter.\" You believe him.\u00a0 One of the problems for actors who make it look so easy is that they are taken for granted, by the industry and by audiences alike. Stanton has not been nominated for any major awards. He has remained under the radar for nearly 60 years. It seems he likes it that way, but his assistant, Logan Sparks, adds a refreshing contradictory opinion. Sparks says, of Stanton, \"He always says 'Do nothing'. If he actually 'did nothing', he'd still be sitting in a rocking chair in Kentucky.\" It's a fair point. People may drift into one or two good roles, or a good five-year run of movies. One does not \"drift\" into a 60-year-long career. It takes gumption, ambition, and commitment, all words that seem anathema to Stanton.  When Harry Dean Stanton was fourteen years old, he was home alone, and he became so conscious of \"the void\", of the nothing-ness at the heart of existence, that he called up his aunt to \"to see if [he] was still connected.\" Facing the void, or, more accurately, living with the knowledge that the void exists, is at the heart of Harry Dean Stanton's personality, and his work as an actor. Sitting in the back seat of a car during one of his nocturnal jaunts through Los Angeles, he mentions that when he thinks of how fast the earth is going around the sun it makes him nervous, because \"there isn't anything I can do about it.\" He looks out at the dreamy nightscape of Los Angeles from Mulholland Drive and muses that all of this is temporary, the universe will end someday, death is a part of life. \"And that's not a negative concept,\" he says. \"It's just what is. It's liberating.\"  Advertisement Shot beautifully by Seamus McGarvey, \"Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction\" is a compelling collage of a man who has been ubiquitous in American films for over half a century and is still with us, still working, still staring out at that horizon. The film takes its title from the Kris Kristofferson song \"He's a Pilgrim\", which could be said to describe Stanton:  \"He's a poet, he's a pickerHe's a prophet, he's a pusherHe's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned.He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.\"", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Band Aid", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Most of us know couples who seem to barely tolerate one another; who roll their eyes while their partner is talking; who simmer with low-level contempt for one another and don't bother to hide it. Whatever valid reason there may be for turning the relationship sour, couples like this are a huge bore. Anna (Zoe Lister-Jones) and Ben (Adam Pally) in \"Band Aid\" are that kind of couple. They show up at events carrying their thunder-cloud with them.\u00a0 One day, at a kids' birthday party, Anna and Ben pick up a plastic microphone and make up a song on the spot, poking fun at themselves and their fights. A small space of communication opens up and they decide to start a band. This is the premise of \"Band Aid,\" written, directed, and produced by Lister-Jones, who also wrote all of the songs performed by the couple in the film. Lister-Jones is the very definition of a \"phenom,\" and if the film sometimes falls back on clich\u00e9, there's enough charm and interest here\u2014particularly in the chemistry between the two leads\u2014to keep it afloat. Advertisement \"Band Aid\" is the story of two disappointed, stuck people who get re-inspired through creating music together. Anna had a book deal once, but it fell through. Now she makes money as an Uber driver. Ben is a freelance artist who designs corporate logos, but really, though, all he does is lie on the couch, smoke weed, and watch television. Their relationship is not on autopilot so much as it has descended into a constant state of increasingly toxic bickering. Their couples therapist informs them that she's moving to Canada, her tone suggesting that the move may be to get away from them. Collaborating requires communication. In the space of songwriting, Anna and Ben find their fights absurd, even entertaining. In that space, they can say anything to each other. All of it is grist for the mill. They rope in their neighbor Dave (Fred Armisen) to be their drummer. He's an extremely strange man (practically the Platonic Ideal of the \"weird neighbor\" sitcom clich\u00e9) but game for the task of keeping the beat for the two maniacs onstage in front of him. Performing at open mic nights creates a sense of togetherness in Anna and Ben in a way that couples therapy never did. Lister-Jones' songs are punk-rock and grunge inspired, with snarky lyrics, screaming choruses, simple chord changes. Pally and Lister-Jones seem to get a legitimate kick out of one another during their duets, and the characters experience a catharsis like no other when they sing together. Lister-Jones celebrates the wild free-fall of that creative space, the embracing of the unknown, saying \"Yes\" to new experiences, the terror of the blank page. Like the wonderful film \"Music and Lyrics,\" \"Band Aid\" shows how creative collaboration\u2014a shared project, something to DO together besides just being a couple\u2014is a great basis for a relationship. Hell, it worked for Richard and Linda Thompson. (Briefly, anyway.) \"Band Aid\" is quite insightful in its observations about the expectations that marriage imposes on couples (couples who buy the conventional lie, that is). You'd think two bohemian types like Anna and Ben could resist succumbing to phony roles such as \"husband,\" \"wife,\" \"breadwinner,\" etc., but no. The institution is too strong. The frustration of the film (possibly inadvertent) is watching two people so readily buy into a life that does not suit them at all. Lister-Jones and Pally have a free-wheeling improvisational chemistry that anchors the film and saves it from sentimentality. In their hands, both Anna and Ben are clearly funny people, even when they're saying terrible things. Pally was so great in a similar two-hander, 2015's \"Night Owls,\" a film that also relied on his ability to listen and react, to create a comedic context for the sometimes extremely serious events in the film. That's a hard line to walk and he does it beautifully. He's wonderful at suggesting that Ben's bratty behavior comes from Ben's baffled response to the Gloomy Gus his wife has become. He doesn't know what to do and so he \"checks out.\" And Lister-Jones' performance illuminates\u2014in every pause, every barb, every scowl\u2014that this is a woman who has not dealt with her traumas and disappointments (real and perceived) in any meaningful way. Pally and Lister-Jones have a \"riff\" dynamic, energy sparking up and deflating, exploding, subsiding, one-liners\u2014funny and cruel\u2014careening out of their mouths. \"Band Aid\" deals with some pretty serious topics, but it doesn't have the raw-wound quality of films like \"Blue Valentine\" or \"The Break-Up,\" two movies that also present the wreckage left behind when love departs the scene. \"Band Aid\" is mostly interested in what happens when two unhappy people sit down with pen and paper and try to create something out of nothing.

{"Title": "Animals", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The thing about drug addicts is that, regardless of their background, ultimately, they are all the same. Anyone who has known a drug addict has looked on helplessly as the individual's personality is co-opted by the addiction, turning the specific narrative of a specific human being into a predictable clich\u00e9. It's devastating for all involved, and onlookers (family and friends) wonder what the hell happened to their sweet daughter, their ambitious son. That's the main challenge with stories about drug addicts: there aren't a million stories to tell, there are only a couple, because the addiction operates like clockwork. Descents into addiction are a favorite topic of films, from \"Lost Weekend\" to \"Panic in Needle Park\" to \"Drugstore Cowboy\" to \"Requiem for a Dream\" ... Such stories can operate as cautionary tales or they can be queasily voyeuristic and sensational. Collin Schiffli's strong directorial debut, \"Animals\", (with a script by David Dastmalchian, who also stars) is neither cautionary nor voyeuristic. It tells the story of a young couple whose only remaining bond is their heroin addiction, and when their drug-scoring schemes start to dry up, reality closes in with all the subtlety of a car crashing into a brick wall at high speed. Advertisement At first, Jude (Dastmalchian) and his girlfriend Bobbie (Kim Shaw), hanging out in Chicago, sleeping in their car, looking for their next fix, seem like an adorable rom-com version of drug addicts. They hold hands as they walk down the street. Bobbie keeps all of her possessions in a child's metal lunch box. They go to the zoo together and look at lions and camels and tigers through the bars of the cage. (The constant animal imagery is on-the-nose in its symbolism, although it does lead to the overwhelming strangeness and beauty of the final shot.) \u00a0Neither of them are in touch with their families anymore. Calling home for help is no longer an option. Their lives have been pared down to such a sterile landscape that there is only room for each other, and for the drugs.\u00a0 This is not a \"slippery slope\" movie, like other stories about addicts. In \"Animals,\" they are already at the bottom \u00a0of the slope. Taking place in a very condensed period of time, \"Animals\" features an alarming (and effective) swerve in mood, from the nearly-bucolic opening sequences, (blinking in the morning light into the camera flares, giggling over a successful con, the glory of the heroin high itself) to a more jagged and terrifying energy in the second half of the film. Bobbie and Jude shoplift CDs and then sell them in order to buy drugs. She pretends to be a sex worker, setting up \"dates\" with random guys through an ad she and Jude placed in the paper. They end up conning a security guard over a fictional stolen laptop in a scam that is so complicated it almost reaches the slam-dunk of Moses and Addie Pray's money trick in \"Paper Moon.\" But the scams get more dangerous. And without constant fixes throughout the day, the addiction becomes urgent, a wild animal that demands to be fed (in case you missed the symbolism of all the images of roaring lions and scratching gorillas sprinkled throughout.) \"Animals\" was filmed in Chicago, and Schiffli and cinematographer Larkin Donley, use that unmistakable urban landscape to beautiful and haunting lengths. Bobbie and Jude live everywhere and nowhere. Down in the Loop, or in Lincoln Park, in Wrigleyville and elsewhere, life is bustling and social and crowded. Bobbie and Jude walk around on the fringes of all of that, huddled in the empty spaces between the cracks. They stroll along the lakefront, stepping over sunbathers, they try to score drugs on the emptied-out outskirts of the city where the avenues are wide and deserted. Chicago seems mainly unpopulated except for the two of them, a perfect portrayal of the self-absorbed world of drugs. John Heard has a nice cameo as a security guard who befriends Bobbie in a way that actually gets through to her, his kindness coming with no strings and no judgment. The cinematography is not flashy but Donley is responsive to striking contrasts between bleak empty lots with the gleaming skyline beyond, to different moods and shapes (Jude lying long and flat in a hospital bed, with the blue flat line of Lake Michigan out the window a perfect example). It's a beautiful-looking film. Advertisement \"Animals\" is frank about Bobbie and Jude's middle-class background. During one scene, Jude lists all of his privileges, showing awareness of his fortunate status in the culture. Of course being born fortunate is not a bulwark against drug addiction, but it can provide a cushion when the bottom falls out.\u00a0Judd's teeth are rotting, Bobbie's breast hurts to the touch, Judd is constipated, but the middle-class well-fed glow of both of them still lingers, an echo of what used to be.\u00a0 There are a couple of things that make \"Animals\" effective, the main one being the performances of the two leads and the symbiotic relationship they create. Dimly, like light reaching us from a star long-dead, both actors are able to suggest that once upon a time Bobbie and Jude made a cute couple. They have been together a long time. They are not so far gone that their moral compasses are completely shattered. In one wonderful scene, the two of them, jittery from withdrawal, decide to demand money from a woman rocking a baby stroller in a park. Jude takes out his needle, saying, \"I'll tell her I have AIDS and that I'll stick her with this needle...\" Bobbie says, \"Tell her you'll stick her baby. She'll give you anything then.\" The second the words come out of her mouth, her face practically melts in the horror of what she just said. It's a gorgeous moment, beautifully conceived and beautifully played, ugly and real and terrible. Jude, ultimately, cannot go through with the scheme, informing Bobbie as he gets back in the car, \"I couldn't go through with it,\" and Bobbie says, in tears, \"I didn't want you to go through with it.\"\u00a0 Such small moments (and there are many in the film) help make what is a typical story memorable and somewhat unique. It's not a particularly interesting relationship because drug addicts tend to be boring, but it is a pleasure to watch both of these actors work.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Handmaiden", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Park Chan-Wook\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d is a love story, revenge thriller and puzzle film set in Japanese-occupied Korea in the 1930s. It is voluptuously beautiful, frankly sexual, occasionally perverse and horrifically violent. At times its very existence feels inexplicable. And yet all of its disparate pieces are assembled with such care, and the characters written and acted with such psychological acuity, that you rarely feel as if the writer-director is rubbing the audience\u2019s nose in excess of one kind or another. This is a film made by an artist at the peak of his powers: Park, a South Korean director who started out as a critic, has many great or near-great genre films, including \u201cOldboy,\u201d \u201cSympathy for Mr. Vengeance,\u201d \u201cLady Vengeance\u201d and \u201cThirst,\u201d but this one is so intricate yet light-footed that it feels like the summation of his career to date.  Advertisement It\u2019s also as inspiring an example of East-West cross-pollination as cinema has given us, on par with Akira Kurosawa\u2019s adaptations of Shakespeare, Dostoevsky and Dashiell Hammett in its ability to submerge a respected source while keeping its outlines visible. The plot faintly evokes many Gothic thrillers (chiefly \"Rebecca,\" \"Jane Eyre\" and \"Gaslight\") and quite a few examples of film noir as well; Park\u2019s source is Sarah Waters\u2019 Fingersmith, a 2002 novel set in Dickensian England that was previously made as a 2005 British miniseries. The result seems at once specifically English, specifically Korean and not of this astral plane; like Park\u2019s best work, it\u2019s an expressionistic, at times surreal movie that skates along the knife-edge of dreams. Every frame pulses with life, sometimes with blood.  The script tells of a spirited female pickpocket named Sooki, actually named Tamako ( Kim Tae-ri), who gets a job as a handmaiden at the estate of a rich old book collector (Lee Yong-nyeo), serving him and Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), the niece of his late wife; she gets pulled into a scheme by a fake count who wants to marry the niece and have her committed to an asylum so that he can claim her fortune; the book collector, the fake count\u2019s mentor, has more or less the same plan in mind. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not that interested in money itself,\u201d says the fake count, who was raised by a Korean fisherman but claims to be Japanese and calls himself Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo). \u201cWhat I desire is\u2014how shall I put it?\u2014the manner of ordering wine without looking at the price.\u201d  The plan is fiendishly complicated, but it grows thornier still when Sooki/Tamako starts falling in love with her target. Their blossoming affair is tenderly observed\u2014a startlingly blunt sex scene is delayed until fairly deep into the film, and preceded by many scenes that pivot upon subtle glances, overheard remarks, and moments where one woman rushes to the other\u2019s defense. The fake count is handsome and can be dashing at times\u2014Ha looks so at home in a tuxedo that you could imagine him wearing it to a supermarket\u2014but he\u2019s also pig who seems to revel in his piggishness, and his intended target sees through him immediately. When he calls her \u201cmesmerizing\u201d over a tense dinner, she replies, \u201cMen use the word \u2018mesmerizing\u2019 when they wish to touch a lady\u2019s breasts.\u201d He\u2019s upfront about his utter cyncism and lack of affection for Lady Hideko, a crushed flower of a woman who was raised from girlhood as a virtual prisoner by the book collector after\u2014well, let\u2019s just call it a tragedy, because now we\u2019re at the point in this review where describing any specific moment or scene from \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d in detail would rob readers of one of the great pleasures of watching a densely plotted, elegantly executed motion picture: having no idea of what\u2019s about to happen next, yet nearly always being surprised and enthralled by both the twist itself and the film\u2019s presentation of it.  Advertisement So here we go, somewhat vaguely, into the breach: nothing is what it seems in this movie, and the things that aren\u2019t what they seem aren\u2019t quite what they don\u2019t seem to be, if that makes any sense at all (and if it doesn\u2019t right now, trust me: it will). Most of the story takes place in and around the book collector\u2019s country estate, a splendidly realized creation that\u2019s not just one of the great mansions in film history\u2014rivaled in recent movies only by the estate in another modern Gothic romance, \u201cCrimson Peak\u201d\u2014but also an organizing metaphor for the whole film. It seems to change size and shape depending on a visitor\u2019s angle of approach, and once you\u2019re inside it, the geography at first seems so clear that you could draw floor plans of its most frequently used spaces; but after a few more scenes, you realize that you only saw a small part of the house, and not only are there rooms and wings you\u2019ve never laid eyes on, there are secret doors and hidden passageways that only certain characters know about, leading to places where they can go to make love, commit sadistic acts of violence, or spy on each other. Soon enough, the movie teaches you how to watch it, and you start asking questions, like, \u201cWhat does this person truly hope to gain from sneaking here, doing this, stealing that?\u201d and \u201cAre they really spying in secret, or do the spied-upon people know somebody is watching?\" and \u201cAre the emotions being expressed by that character real, or are they faking it, or are they seeming to fake it while actually feeling those feelings?\u201d  A good many moments resonate not because of what one character is saying, but because of the looks on other characters\u2019 faces as they hear their words and either contemplate their true meaning or visualize images to accompany them. One of many show-stopping setpieces is a reading of perverse erotica from the book collector\u2019s library, accompanied by one of the weirdest sex shows in mainstream cinema, but most of the sequence\u2019s eerie power derives from observing the rapt expressions of men who\u2019ve gathered to hear explicit fiction read aloud. Nearly as powerful, though far subtler, are the cross-cut sequences that feel like self-contained short stories of their own. Dialogue or recited scraps of letters or fiction become de facto narration laid over a cascade of images, brilliantly composed for a very wide frame by Chung Chung-hoon, and backed by Cho Young-wuk\u2019s hypnotically repetitive yet rapturously melodramatic score, which rises to operatic heights when the characters are experiencing misery, ecstasy or fear. Park\u2019s sense of texture and color seems as intuitive as a painter\u2019s, but the film\u2019s narrative construction is as right-brained as Christopher Nolan at his wonkiest. \"The Handmaiden\" is neatly diced into thirds, each approximately 45 minutes long, each narrated by a different major character with parenthetical mini-narratives embedded within each, Russian nesting doll-style. As you ease into the middle third, you start to see moments and images revisited from different angles, seen or heard from fresh vantage points, or picked up slightly earlier or slightly later, altering their meaning or revealing previously withheld facts. The result is a rare film that could be equally well-represented by a billboard-sized collage of randomly chose still-frames, and a flowchart. \u201cEven listening to the same story, people imagine different things,\u201d a character warns us, so deep into the movie that the line plays not like a revelation, but a confirmation of what we we\u2019ve been feeling in our marrow.  Advertisement As you might have deduced, \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d is a story that is also about storytelling, and writing, and picture making, and the obsessive-compulsive attention to detail that links so many great artists throughout history, regardless of medium, worldview or temperament. The movie is filled with literal and figurative nods to the act of artistic creation, from the loving close-ups of the book collector\u2019s treasured volumes, the drawings and paintings made by Hideko and the fake count (he was originally hired to tutor her), and the shots of calligraphic sentences scratched onto letters and scrolls, to the way that blood spilled by lovemaking or disfigurement blooms upon mattresses and stone floors, rhyming with the lotus blossoms glimpsed in trees over the characters' heads, the eruptions of green that accompany transitions from indoors to outdoors, extreme closeups of voyeurs' eyeballs, and shots of a full moon so bright that it seems to be burning a hole through the clouds.  These touches are all striking in their own right. But they never feel ostentatiously disconnected from the story and characters. \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d is about a lot of things, among them trust and vulnerability, imprisonment and freedom, and the tension between the authentic self and the fa\u00e7ade that individuals create, and that society imposes from without. Park never loses track of these ideas or forgets about them, but they never expressed in tediously rhetorical terms\u2014always in a gliding, playful, often audaciously musical way. \"The Handmaiden\" stirs the senses by appealing to our gut feelings, our sense of morals and ethics, and our appreciation for the sight of great artists making magic as if it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Dean", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cDean\u201d is a movie that very clearly came from humane and compassionate impulses. This is particularly evident during the final third of the film, during which the principal characters reluctantly shed their defensive quirks and face up to the issues of grief and loss that have been dogging them throughout the movie.  That said, \u201cDean\u201d is also a movie with which it is easy to find fault, and if you\u2019re a particular kind of person, you\u2019ll find fault with it without even trying too hard. The movie is the directorial debut of Demetri Martin. Demetri Martin of the floppy Beatles-esque haircut (which he\u2019s still rocking at 44, an age at which those Beatles that survived to that age had rethunk their tonsorial stylings more than once) and the wry jokes and the minimalist visual-pun cartoons and the demeanor so relentlessly quiet-hipster-twee that he makes Wes Anderson look like Ozzy Osbourne. Said demeanor is on full display here, as Martin, of course, also stars in his directorial debut, which he also wrote.  Advertisement The movie opens with the writer/director/star standing at a gravesite with Kevin Kline. Kline and Martin play father and son, and the grave is that of the wife of Kline\u2019s Robert and mother of Martin\u2019s Dean. (Yes, of course Martin plays the title character.) Robert is an engineer\u2014Dean observes of him that every crisis he encounters represents a problem to be practically solved\u2014while Dean is a cartoonist who lives, you\u2019ll never guess, in Brooklyn, one of the nice leafy brownstone neighborhoods rather than the beardo-infested environs of Williamsburg or some such, so I guess that makes some kind of difference.  Father and son are handling loss in their own way. Robert wants to sell his suburban house (the \u201cflight\u201d instinct), which sets Dean right off\u2014what about his memories, his share in the house, which he seems not to have contributed to the mortgage payments on, but never mind. Dean\u2019s way of dealing had begun when his mom had gotten sick. Hoping to demonstrate that he was on a life\u2019s path that would please her, he ill-advisedly got engaged to a woman he had not been ready to commit to. Now the mother has died, the engagement is off, and Dean is acting out passive-aggressively against his ex-girlfriend, against the best friend at whose wedding he makes an ass of himself, and against his father and his house-selling scheme, which he tries to duck by flying out to Los Angeles on a faux-business trip. There he has an awful meeting with some super-miserable Internet bros (one of whom is played by Beck Bennett of \u201cSNL\u201d), and a cute meeting with Nicky, an attractive young woman he embarrasses himself in front of at one of those parties where the East Coast guy discovers that all his friends who\u2019ve moved to California have become self-absorbed monsters. I know what you\u2019re thinking: wait, isn\u2019t this \u201cGarden State\u201d with the geographics reversed? And aren\u2019t we so over the alienated-guy-meets-you-know-what-kind-of-uplifting-female-character scenario? Well, sort of, and sort of. Martin\u2019s Dean is certainly sardonic in his anti-macho way (\u201cI can\u2019t bring myself to work with people who call themselves \u2018creatives\u2019\u201d is one of the Dean apercus meant to elicit a knowing chuckle from his target demo), and his forlorn qualities are hardly unfamiliar. As for Gillian Jacobs\u2019 Nicky, her appeal does have a certain pixieish quality. There seems to be an inevitability to the Nicky/Dean pairing that\u2019s paralleled across the country in a storyline that find\u2019s Kline\u2019s dad getting intrigued by Mary Steenburgen\u2019s Carol, a real-estate agent who\u2019s helping with the under-protest-from-Dean house sale. Where the movie becomes worthwhile is at the point when the storyline puts up the speed bumps to the happy ending.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Holy Hell", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"Holy Hell,\" a documentary by Will Allen, is an account of an American religious cult as told by a filmmaker who was right in the middle of it in the 80s, and whose skills were put in service of glorifying it. Much of it consists of video footage generated by Allen when he was a member of the Buddhafield, a homegrown religion led by a man named Michel.\u00a0 Imagine you'd purchased a ticket to an evening with a filmmaker, during which he played some of the video footage he created during his time in a cult, and talked about the circumstances and about his overall experience. That's fine insofar as it goes\u2014it might even be a fun (though perhaps slightly disturbing) night out\u2014but it doesn't really add up to a compelling nonfiction feature, a format that requires some shape, a narrative spine, and a point beyond \"here is this strange thing that happened to me once.\" Advertisement Something seems off from the opening moments of the movie, which juxtapose images of Allen's stint as Buddhafield's house director with footage from his childhood as a precocious Steven Spielberg-wannabe, shooting low budget knockoffs of blockbusters like \"Jaws\" with a Super 8mm camera. (I wouldn't have minded seeing some of those films at length, honestly; they look utterly charming.) It feels a bit too much like a clip reel, advertising Allen as a filmmaker and a nice person.\u00a0 He talks about coming of age as a gay man and how his mother failed to support him, and then suddenly we skip ahead and he's in the cult. We don't get much sense of how he ended up there, exactly\u2014I mean the dramatic arc of it, the line you can trace from childhood to that moment. Nor are we given enough information and insight to understand what the cult is like on a day-to-day level\u2014what its rules and beliefs are, what the experience of life is like there. Mostly we're looking at footage of people experiencing some sort of rapture in nature. It could be an evangelical Christian group where hands are laid on the body; it could be a bunch of post-hippies tripping somewhere; it's all rather fuzzy. So is Michel, though as the story unfolds we at least get a strong feeling of of how petty, vindictive and controlling he was. (Cult leaders aren't generally known as well-adjusted people.) Throughout, there's a frustrating sense that a potentially fascinating and unsettling experience has been glossed over. At times Allen seems to be protecting himself from harsh judgment; as Michel's chief PR architect and keeper of legend, executing his requests, he is complicit in some of his former leader's worst behavior, but we don't get a clear sense of why he keep saying yes to his demands, beyond the need to kowtow the leader's charisma. In a first-person documentary where the main character is the storyteller, we really need to get a sense of how every major life choice originates in the storyteller's psychology and personal experience. We are never really privy to the depth of remorse and shame Allen surely feels at having helped burnish the image of an obviously disturbed and very destructive man. At times, the movie seems to be turning away from its subject, as you might strategically turn away from a guest at a party that you would rather not talk to. This is curious. This film's very existence amounts to an apology and an explanation, or at the very least an inquest into the self. But that should've come across much more strongly, to the point where it was hard to look at the movie because it made us feel incredulity and embarrassment at the weirdest, darkest, most inexplicable parts of our own experience.\u00a0\"Holy Hell\" should have dug a lot deeper and told its story with a lot more finesse. What happened? Maybe, after all these years, Allen was still too close to his subject? \u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Seymour: An Introduction", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The title of the new documentary directed by and featuring\r\nEthan Hawke provides a vague indication of the work\u2019s eventual assets and\r\nliabilities. On one level, the title is straightforward: the movie does\r\nintroduce viewers to Seymour Bernstein, a classical pianist in his 80s who, at\r\nthe midpoint of his life, gave up public performances and became a teacher of\r\npiano instead. Then there\u2019s the allusion to J.D. Salinger\u2019s novella, an account\r\nof the precocious genius of the Glass family, by now something of an American\r\nliterary legend. Although the evocation of Salinger and his creation evokes\r\nintriguing associations of reclusiveness and talent and all that, in the end\r\nthere\u2019s not much here to do with Salinger or his character: the title plays on\r\na coincidence, and is in a sense a bit cute and/or pretentious (my own\r\npreferred term is \u201cknow-somethingish\u201d).\u00a0 Advertisement Hawke might have more appropriately called\r\nhis short feature \u201cSeymour: An Interrogation,\u201d because while the film lays out\r\nBernstein\u2019s life story and his perceptions on art, and explores his talent,\r\nHawke makes clear from the outset that he chose Bernstein as a subject (the two\r\nmet when seated next to each other at a dinner party) in order to explore\r\nquestions hyphenate Hawke (the \u201cBoyhood\u201d and \u201cTraining Day\u201d co-star has accrued\r\nnot just several directorial credits but is a published author as well) has\r\nabout his own artistic practice. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was authentic,\u201d Hawke\r\nadmits of his own work in an early conversation with Bernstein. He apparently\r\nsees something very authentic in his subject.  In limning the world of classical music during the period in\r\nwhich Bernstein practiced, then abandoned, performance, Hawke gives viewers the\r\npicture of a very different New York City than exists today: a Manhattan, or\r\nat least a pocket of Manhattan, both aesthetically refined and at least mildly\r\naffluent. In a caf\u00e9, Bernstein reminisces with an adult former student who\r\nneglected his lessons to the extent that he became \u201cincorrigible;\u201d this\r\nwell-heeled fellow is Michael Kimmelman, now an art critic for \u201cThe New York\r\nTimes.\u201d\u00a0 Throughout the picture, Bernstein interacts with genteel folk who\r\nquietly deplore what they see as the American perception of art and\r\nart-making\u2014\u201cthey want the \u2018Flashdance\u2019 fallacy,\u201d one sighs, alluding to a\r\ntalent that flies out of a bottle like a genie with no craft or labor involved.\r\nIn between these exchanges, Bernstein works with young students, counting out\r\nmeasures, contemplating accents, working out the problem of how to get one\u2019s\r\npinkie to just this particular distant piano key in time to make the musical\r\nphrase coherent. Like Jody Lee Lipes\u2019 recent documentary \u201cBallet 422,\u201d Hawke\u2019s\r\nmovie patiently demonstrates that Art Needs Work. But it also needs philosophy,\r\nand Hawke, while never so louche as to just up and ask the reason Bernstein\r\ngave up the limelight to impart his wisdom to others instead, prods the ways\r\nBernstein\u2019s struggles to be a great performer abraded his desire to be a decent\r\nhuman being.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cJackson Pollock and\u2026Marlon Brando were all pretty notoriously\r\nhorrible people,\" Hawke suggests to\r\nBernstein at one point. \u201cThey were. And there are musicians who were monsters,\u201d\r\nBernstein responds. \u201cGlenn Gould, for example,\u201d Hawke offers. Bernstein takes\r\nthe bait, and offers up some spicy Gould dish. For Bernstein, the tragedy of\r\nGould\u2019s approach is that he\u2019s only able to hear Gould\u2019s playing: \u201cI don\u2019t hear\r\nBach,\u201d Bernstein says. Hawke lets it lay, not pursuing the question of whether\r\nthere\u2019s any value in hearing Gould qua Gould. Also curious is, given how one of\r\nthe film\u2019s threads seems to deplore the trappings of fame and acclaim him,\r\nBernstein\u2019s pleasure in having apparently played a small part in gaining a\r\nknighthood for the British pianist Clifford Curzon.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think the\r\ncontradictions implied here can\u2019t be resolved or at least fruitfully explored;\r\nit\u2019s that Hawke doesn\u2019t seem to think so. So the movie kind of flits along\u2014if\r\none wanted to be cruel one would use a word like \u201cdilettante\u201d\u2014pleasantly and\r\ninformatively enough without ever lifting off. Until the last fifteen minutes\r\nor so, in which Bernstein, having been convinced to play a semi-private recital\r\nfor Hawke\u2019s theater company, performs and discusses Schumann\u2019s \u201cFantasia.\u201d\r\nHawke, in a rather disarming display of cinematic virtuosity, cuts from\r\nBernstein playing the piece, Bernstein directly addressing the camera,\r\nBernstein directly addressing a live audience, keeping the music on a through\r\nline for the most part as Bernstein lays out its history and its significance\r\nfor both himself and music itself. A prior pronouncement by mystic Andrew\r\nHarvey, \u201cI had an experience of music creating the whole universe,\u201d suddenly\r\nseems a little less dippy. The effect of the sequence is both pedagogically\r\nrewarding and aesthetically transportive. It lifts the movie into a higher\r\nrealm.", "Critic": "Gamma"}

He seems like a nice kid, the kind stunned to\r\nbe invited to a cool party in Manhattan on an October night. When his friend, who is also his ride,\r\nbails on him, Naz \u201cborrows\u201d his father\u2019s taxi to go into the city. As he\u2019s\r\ntrying to find the party, a beautiful young woman gets into his cab. She wants\r\nto go to the beach. She's pretty enough and mysterious enough that Naz plays along. By the end of the night, he\u2019ll be arrested\r\nfor murder.  This first hour, shot by the legendary Robert Elswit (\u201cThere\r\nWill Be Blood,\u201d \u201cInherent Vice\u201d) and directed by Steven Zaillian (all but one\r\nhour were helmed by the director of \u201cSearching For Bobby Fischer,\u201d and that one\r\nwas directed by \u201cMan on Wire\u201d\u2019s James Marsh), hums like the best procedurals.\r\nModern, educated TV audiences know something is going to happen to Naz\u2014there\u2019s\r\nno show otherwise\u2014but the premiere takes its time with details that you won\u2019t\r\neven know matter until episodes later when the show is in trial. Every\r\nencounter, every decision, every moment feels both naturally captured\u2014thanks in\r\nlarge part to Ahmed\u2019s spectacularly lived-in performance, which only gets better in subsequent episodes\u2014and also part of a\r\ncomplex piece of art. In that sense, \u201cThe Night Of\u201d reminds one of Lumet\u2019s '70s and \u201880s\r\nfilms in that character is never lost in the \u201cbigger picture\u201d of mystery or\r\ncommentary. Lumet had an incredible ability to tell NY stories that were both sprawling and intimate. \"The Night Of\" shares that duality. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the arguable protagonist of the\r\npiece, attorney John Stone (John Turturro) has echoes of Paul Newman\u2019s Frank Galvin from \u201cThe Verdict.\u201d He carries around business cards with his smiling face\r\nand just happens on Naz in the precinct holding cell on the fateful night in question. Does he see innocence\r\nin Naz\u2019s eyes? Or does he just see opportunity? Exactly what each of the key characters in \u201cThe Night Of\u201d are getting out of the situation, especially major\r\nplayers like Detective Box (the great Bill Camp) and a young attorney named Chandra\r\n(Amara Karan), becomes essential to the way it unfolds. And when Naz gets to\r\nRikers, where young men are held until trial and either hardened further or\r\npossibly even killed, he meets a career criminal (the mesmerizing Michael K. Williams) who\r\nsees him as an opportunity. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d exemplifies the ripple effect of not just crime but the mechanics of a\r\ncriminal investigation, from the men whose path crosses with Naz\u2019s at Rikers to\r\nhis family (including the great Asghar Farhadi regular Peyman Maadi as Naz\u2019s father),\r\nunable to cover his defense.  Advertisement On top of all these great ensemble performances and\r\nmemorable characters, there\u2019s a riveting procedural element to \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d\r\nespecially in the early episodes, in which Zaillian and Price display an\r\nobvious fascination and respect for relatively unwanted jobs being done\u2014from the\r\ngraveyard shift at the police station to the morgue attendants and so on. It\u2019s\r\nthe kind of show where you distinctly hear the squeak of a dry erase marker as it writes \u201cHomicide\u201d\r\non the white board. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d doesn\u2019t cut corners, giving Price fans the\r\ndetails they expect but that we rarely see in episodic television. And yet the\r\nbalance between detail and character is never thrown off. In one sense, it\u2019s a\r\nprocedural with a protagonist uninterested in procedure or facts (Stone makes\r\nclear that he doesn\u2019t care if Naz did it or not\u2014actual guilt or innocence is\r\nonly one issue in the criminal justice system). It unfolds confidently as a\r\ngreat crime novel AND as a character study of two men who would never meet if not for a murder, likely because of Price\u2019s ability\r\nwith the detailed mechanics of the crime novel mixed with Zaillian\u2019s very human touch with actors. Let\u2019s hope\r\nthey work together again soon. (Note: They only made seven of eight episodes available for press so if it all goes off the rails in the final\r\nhour, remember the star rating is based on what I\u2019ve seen. I have faith, though.)", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Dark Places", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Gillian Flynn\u2019s script for\r\nDavid Fincher\u2019s incredible adaptation of \u201cGone Girl\u201d was a master class in\r\ngenre, taking an admittedly ridiculous, twisting and turning narrative and making its plot holes forgivable\r\nthrough sheer force of entertainment value. It makes sense that another of\r\nFlynn\u2019s novels, the sinister \u201cDark Places,\u201d would get the cinematic treatment\r\nas well, although this failed exercise could be used comparatively with \u201cGone\r\nGirl\u201d as a What Not to Do cinematic lesson. Whereas Fincher and Flynn brought\r\nstyle and flair to the saga of Amazing Amy, writer/director Gilles\r\nPaquet-Brenner presents a drab, dull, uninspired affair, enlivened only\r\nslightly by the talented cast assembled. Failing to find a visual language\r\nfor the piece that reaches beyond a Lifetime TV Movie and adapting the material\r\nin such a way that makes her protagonist largely inactive in her own story,\r\nPaquet-Brenner only makes the already-underrated \u201cGone Girl\u201d look even more\r\naccomplished. Advertisement When she was only seven, Libby Day (Sterling Jerins)\r\nsuffered the unimaginable. Her entire family was murdered in a shotgun rampage\r\nlike something out of \u201cIn Cold Blood.\u201d In fact, the murders earned that kind of\r\ninternational attention, especially after Libby\u2019s brother Ben (Tye Sheridan)\r\nwas arrested and sentenced for them. Accused of dabbling in Satanism,\r\nBen was convicted on little evidence, and true crime nuts have been convinced\r\nfor years that there was more to the Day murders. Of course, there was, because,\r\nwell, there\u2019s no movie otherwise. Bitter and hardened by life, grown Libby (Charlize Theron)\r\nhasn\u2019t been in touch with her incarcerated brother (played by Corey Stoll older)\r\nsince the crimes. That\u2019s when she\u2019s contacted by Lyle Wirth (Nicholas Hoult), a\r\nmember of a true crime club that collects items and information from bloodbaths\r\naround the country. He convinces the broke Libby to tell her story to the club,\r\nand she needs the cash enough to do so. Of course, Lyle has ulterior motives,\r\nconvinced that Ben is innocent, and he eventually talks Libby into digging\r\ndeeper into what really happened that night.  Both narratives\u2014the current-day investigation and the days\r\nleading up to the murder years earlier\u2014are intercut in this murky, unrefined\r\nscreenplay that piles up narrative and twists without ever considering the\r\npiece\u2019s deadly lack of characters. Theron does her brooding best to make Libby\r\nthree-dimensional, but, and this could be partly the fault of the source\r\nmaterial, she is almost always merely a listener to someone presenting more\r\ndetails about her past or entirely absent in the extensive flashbacks. Consequently,\r\n\u201cDark Places\u201d is a film without a protagonist, akin to watching recreated footage\r\non \u201cDateline NBC,\u201d as each flashback or revelatory conversation fills in a few more\r\ndetails of the overheated story without giving us a reason to care about it in the\r\nfirst place. Poor Theron wanders through a narrative designed around reveals; so she\u2019s either remembering things she couldn\u2019t have possibly\r\nknown about or hearing about things she should have figured out a long time ago.\r\nAs he often has lately, Corey Stoll actually makes out the best in a few\r\ncrucial scenes as the older Ben, and Hoult certainly isn\u2019t bad even if his\r\ncharacter, like so many of them, feels like a plot device.  Advertisement All of this leads to a distinct lack of urgency in \u201cDark\r\nPlaces,\u201d which makes the dour, depressing subject matter that much harder to\r\nenjoy. It's a checklist of awful things that can happen to a Middle American family. The Day matriarch (Christina Hendricks) is afraid of losing the farm,\r\ntheir dad (a suspect in the murders) is missing, Satanism threatens to entice\r\nyoung Ben, the kid is accused of child abuse, drugs, teenage pregnancy\u2014the whole\r\nthing verges on poverty porn given the lack of genre escapism provided. We\r\nneeded a reason to wallow in the dark places of Libby Day\u2019s horrible life to\r\nmake the cinematic journey worthwhile. No one involved in the production of \u201cDark\r\nPlaces\u201d ever asked a crucial question: Why should we care?", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "U Want Me 2 Kill Him?", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Sixteen-year-old Mark (Jamie Blackley) sits in a cold interrogation room in the opening scenes of \"U Want Me 2 Kill Him?\" and is asked why he stabbed John in the alley. Mark answers, \"For the greater good.\" Based on a true story, which dominated British tabloids in 2003, resulting in a groundbreaking legal case (and inspiring an opera), \"U Want Me 2 Kill Him?\" takes us through how Mark arrived at that particular creepy answer. The facts of the case almost beggar belief, and were told, in full, in a 2005 Vanity Fair article by Judy Bachrach. The film assumes we do not know the story. Director Andrew Douglas, who helmed the \"Amityville Horror\" remake in 2005, and screenwriter Mike Walden, have chosen to structure the film like a typical thriller police procedural, with a jumbled chronology and a third-act reveal when the truth comes out. It's effective, in its way, and the acting is excellent, across the board. But \"U Want Me 2 Kill Him\" side-steps the real fascination with the story, its real guts, which is: Why?  Advertisement Criminal duos are endlessly interesting due to the psychological questions they bring up: Would either of the individuals have acted alone? Would Macbeth have done what he did if he hadn't had his wife whispering in his ear to \"man up\"? Would Leopold and Loeb have ever committed that crime by themselves? What is in the alchemy of the respective pairings that created this murderous third? Cinema loves its deadly duos, from \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" to \"Heavenly Creatures,\" to \"Gun Crazy,\" to \"Don't Deliver Us From Evil\", the list goes on forever. The pairing in \"U Want Me 2 Kill Him?\" is different in many important ways, mainly because Mark is unaware that he is being played. He was a dupe, a fool of a much more cunning individual. What happened to Mark that made him open to the whispered sinister suggestion, what was in him (or not in him) that made him blindly accept everything at face value?  Mark lives with his parents in Manchester. He goes to school, he's popular, and he has big vague dreams of doing something that nobody has done before (\"like create the Internet.\") His parents are nicely drawn individuals, the father who lifts weights and tells his son to be \"his own Master\", while the mother compulsively buys lottery tickets every week. Meanwhile, Mark has a whole world they do not know about. Every night he sexy-chats online with a girl he has never met, a pretty blonde named Rachel (Jaime Winstone). Not only is Rachel great at dirty talk, she is also (and this seems to be the most attractive part to Mark) a damsel in distress. She is afraid of her violent boyfriend Kevin (Mingus Johnston). She has secrets. She also happens to have a little brother who goes to school with Mark, a geeky weird kid named John (Toby Regbo). John gets bullied. Rachel pleads with Mark to look out for him.  Mark and John, somewhat improbably, become friends, after Mark beats up some of the bullies. The two hang out, John opens up to Mark about all of his problems, how worried he is about his sister Rachel, how much he hates how he is treated at school. Through John, Mark learns more about his mysterious night-time Internet friend, Rachel. Her boyfriend is in the witness protection program, she has cut ties with the family, everyone is afraid she is in danger. Ominously, Rachel stops contacting Mark. When Mark confronts John about this, John tearfully tells him that Rachel is dead, probably murdered by Kevin.  Advertisement Mark is devastated. He starts lifting weights. He fools around with his dad's gleaming sword, slicing through the air in his living room, lost in a fantasy of revenge. Things take a turn into the definitely bizarre when an MI5 agent contacts Mark, via IM, and warns him off Kevin, saying that MI5 is tracking Kevin for their own byzantine conspiracy-theory reasons having to do with counter-terrorism. Mark never once questions the credibility of those he encounters online, and never once asks why on earth an MI5 agent would not only reach out to him personally, but enlist his help in another one of their operations. Mark's credulity is certainly believable, and one can sense that this is a boy who doesn't know what he wants to do in life, his grades are not all that good, and he wants to make a big impression on people. He's a perfect \"mark\", in other words.  The puzzle-piece timeline, starting with the crime and the ensuing investigation (led by a police inspector, played by \"Downton Abbey\"'s Joanne Froggatt) mixed with flashbacks to how it all began, works, but the real horror, of why this might have happened, is ultimately lost in the cliched genre-trappings of the story's structure. Instead what we are given is a cautionary tale about being wary of the folks you meet on the Internet, which has been done before and done better. The reason this story ignited debates that persist to this day is the \"why\" of it. How was Mark so manipulated?  Douglas has used an almost entirely blue palate, drenching the film (too much at times) in cold paranoia and isolation. There are some great visuals, John and Mark approaching Kevin's towering tenement building, dwarfed by its sheer stone walls, or the two boys strolling on a rock jetty by the seaside, almost entirely surrounded by water. Mark looks out at the boats in the sea, and they seem misty and glamorous and far far away. These are tantalizing glimpses, hinting at the deeper psychological abysses at play here, but they are left unexplored.  By holding back on the big \"reveal\", by prioritizing the desire to \"sting\" the audience at the end, \"U Want Me 2 Kill Him\" stays frustratingly on the surface.

{"Title": "Tomb Raider", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Based on the 2013 video game, and featuring Alicia Vikander as\u00a0the latest incarnation of a character who's been around for 22 years, \"Tomb Raider\" surprisingly\u00a0plays like a throwback to the classic late-'80s/early '90s\u00a0era of action filmmaking, represented by the likes of \"Cliffhanger,\" \"The Last of the Mohicans,\"\u00a0the first couple of Indiana Jones films, and Jackie Chan's \"Armour of God\" series. From the animated prologue, wherein the title character's archeologist father, Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), tells of an ancient, cursed tomb supposedly containing the all-powerful, weaponizable\u00a0remains of the Japanese shaman queen Himiko, through its gracefully executed series of chases and emotional moments, to its finale set on a Pacific island riddled with booby-trapped ruins, \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0is much better and more original\u00a0than anyone could have expected.\u00a0 Advertisement Although it borrows\u00a0from the game (and, partially, its sequel) for structure and most of its key\u00a0action sequences, \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0never feels like a pointless companion piece to a work that was created for a different medium. I've never played the game this film is adapting, but I\u00a0had a great time watching the movie it inspired, thanks mainly to the\u00a0direction; the stunt choreography, which leans on real performers and props whenever it makes sense to; the emphasis on problem-solving one's way out of tight situations; and most of all,\u00a0the actors, who flesh out archetypal\u00a0characters who might have seemed cliched or merely flat on the page, and make them as real as they can, considering what sort of movie they're in.\u00a0 First among equals is Alicia Vikander with her faintly regal bearing. She's correctly cast as a woman\u00a0who's literally to-the-manor-born, but the\u00a0humility and sense of fair play that she exudes\u00a0makes you like rather than resent the character.\u00a0More importantly, though, she's an action hero par excellence.\u00a0Carved like a wood sculpture, and seemingly bereft of body fat, Vikander hurls\u00a0herself into the film's action sequences. She makes you feel the physicality of this intensely visceral\u00a0performance, letting\u00a0out a high-pitched grunt of rage or pain when Lara crashes into a wall or\u00a0gets slammed on the ground by a brawny\u00a0foe, and letting sparks of fury flash in her eyes as Lara delivers a coup-de-grace. The movie has given a lot of thought to the question of\u00a0how a small woman could successfully fight opponents who are a lot\u00a0bigger and stronger than she is. The answers are relentless\u00a0speed, the strategic use of full body weight, and dirty fighting.\u00a0This is not to say that \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0is \"realistic\" in any sense, because no video game movie is\u2014at one point, Lara powers through after\u00a0a puncture wound that would put a 250-pound Green\u00a0Beret out of commission\u2014but that the filmmakers and Vikander are doing everything they can to sell the physical and emotional reality from moment to moment. Advertisement To that end, \"Tomb Raider\" is more emotionally demonstrative than films in this vein tend to be. As written by\u00a0Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons, there's\u00a0a strong element of domestic\u00a0melodrama at the heart of the tale: Lara's father went missing and is presumed dead. The movie gradually\u00a0fills out the\u00a0details of their relationship, balancing Lara's admiration, even worship, of her father\u00a0against the deep pain\u00a0caused by his frequent absences and ultimate disappearance. This is the story of a daughter learning from, surpassing, and ultimately forgiving\u00a0her dad\u2014a journey that hits fresher beats than you tend to get in genre films starring male heroes\u00a0whose fathers died, vanished, or disappointed them (although the third Indiana Jones movie deals in these themes, too).\u00a0 Paternal abandonment and its aftermath are at the heart of every character's story here.\u00a0Lu Ren (Daniel Wu), the alcoholic sea captain who ferries Lara to the island that contains Himiko's tomb, is dealing with his own daddy issues:\u00a0his same-named father once ran the boat, and ultimately vanished, too, which might account for why their relationship feels more brother-sister than romantic (they obviously\u00a0respect each other, but there's no sexual chemistry because the movie isn't interested in finding any). The bad guy, archaeologist turned corporate mercenary\u00a0Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins), is himself an absentee husband and father.\u00a0He's\u00a0spent seven years trying to locate Himiko's tomb at the behest of the mysterious Trinity organization, and feels great resentment toward the unseen master who's keeping him on the island\u00a0until he can complete\u00a0the job.\u00a0 Lara is an emotional person who has empathy for others and feels things deeply. I liked how you could hear the catch in her voice or see tears almost well up in her eyes as she deals with moments that cause her distress, because these details\u00a0affirm the validity of such a response, and confirm\u00a0that the movie isn't going to just graft a bunch of standard-issue, strong-silent tough guy cliches onto a female lead\u00a0and call it a day. There's more sensitivity and intelligence on display here\u00a0than there needed to be,\u00a0and while \"Tomb Raider\" doesn't go as far in this direction\u00a0as I\u00a0would've liked, the unmistakable effort means a lot. \u00a0Particularly striking is the moment after Lara kills someone for the first time: she sits next to the corpse for a long moment, looking psychically disturbed as well as physically exhausted. The act of\u00a0killing is presented in such a cavalier manner in so many action and adventure\u00a0films that it\u2019s a bit shocking to see it treated as if it means something. Advertisement In the end, though, this is a movie about a woman running, running, running, running, and then maybe\u00a0pausing just long enough to kill a man with a bow and arrow, defeat him in hand-to-hand combat, or solve a tumbler-styled puzzle that will open the stone door of a temple containing ancient treasures.\u00a0\"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0treats Vikander as a moving piece of sculpture, admiring her not in a sexually objectifying way,\u00a0but as one might an athlete.\u00a0When filming her in action, director Roar Uthaug (\"The Wave\")\u00a0often adopts the perspective of an especially kinetic videogame, shooting Vikander from a low angle as she races toward the camera, or from an elevated perspective looking at the back of her head and her shoulders, the better to appreciate Lara as she cuts a path through her world.\u00a0 There are at least five action sequences in this movie that rank with the best I've seen recently. The first is a\u00a0\"fox hunt\" on bicycles\u00a0through the streets of London which sees\u00a0Lara, who works as a\u00a0bike messenger before embracing her destiny as heir to her dad's legacy, leading a pack of her colleagues on a\u00a0chase through winding streets packed with cars and trucks. Another finds Lara diving off a cliff into a raging river; she catches herself before going over a waterfall by clinging to a rusted-out,\u00a0World War II-era bomber that's teetering\u00a0on its edge, then gradually moves over and through the rotting husk of the\u00a0plane, trying to get to the riverbank before the whole thing falls apart. (A great Indiana Jones-style moment: as she hears the buckling groan and sees the plane falling to pieces, she mutters, \"Really?\")\u00a0 There are frustrations here and there, mainly having to do with the plotting and some of the\u00a0supporting characters, who are lively and memorable but often lack one or two scenes that would've made them seem as mythically vivid as the material demands. (Vogel's misery is fascinating at first, but ultimately becomes tedious, and I\u00a0didn't like the way the film sidelined Ren during the final act.) Still, this is a beautifully crafted and unpretentious piece of action cinema, with a number of sequences that are as gorgeous as they are thrilling, and\u00a0a female hero who's as elegant\u00a0as she is deadly:\u00a0an ass-kicking Audrey Hepburn.

{"Title": "Tangerine", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Tangerine\" is a comedy about a transgender prostitute looking for her pimp's girlfriend\r\n on Christmas Eve, shot with an iPhone camera. That description sounds like it could have been written as part of a parody of a film festival schedule. But the movie is the real deal. As written \r\nby Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch and directed by Baker, it's assured and immensely likable, and truly \r\nindependent in story and style. The heroine is Sin-Dee \r\nRella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez), who gets out of jail after six weeks and \r\nlearns from her best friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) that the pimp she's \r\nin love with cheated on her while she was away\u2014and with a cisgender \r\nfemale, of all things. This betrayal is established in the opening scene\r\n of \"Tangerine,\" a conversation near the front window of a coffee shop. \r\nThe scene lasts several minutes and is carried entirely by the \r\nperformers' energy and humor, and by Baker and Radium Cheng's innovative photography. The movie was shot with an Anamorphic widescreen attachment, and the colors are \r\nsuper-saturated to the point where Sin-Dee and Alexandra might as well \r\nbe characters in a Technicolor musical. The result is at once edgy and glossy, adjectives you don't normally see paired. Sin-Dee withdraws \r\ninto sullen rage and stalks through the neighborhood. She spends the first \r\nhalf of the movie looking for the girlfriend, Dinah (Mickey O'Hagan), \r\nwhose blond whiteness and God-given ladyparts amount to a double insult.\r\n During the second half, she's looking for her pimp, Chester (James \r\nRansome, aka Ziggy on HBO's \"The Wire\"). Woe betide the bastard: Sin-Dee\r\n has fire in her eyes. Advertisement Sin-Dee's odyssey through Hollywood \r\nprovides the film's main action, but there are a couple of parallel \r\nstories. One involves Alexandra's attempts to get everyone to come see \r\nher perform that night at a local nightclub; she hands out postcards \r\nwhen she's not chasing after her friend and inquiring about the targets \r\nof Sin-Dee's wrath. The second strand belongs to an Armenian cabdriver \r\nnamed Razmik (Karren Karagulian) who is married and has a child but \r\nfrequents transgender prostitutes on the side. His tastes are quite \r\nspecific, and he won't settle. In one of the movie's most revealing \r\nscenes (in every sense), Razmik picks up a prostitute that he assumes is his\r\n type only to discover that she has a vagina, and angrily demands that \r\nshe get out of his cab immediately.  This scene could stand for \r\n\"Tangerine\" itself. It creates its own world, one with different \r\ndefinitions of \"normal\" or \"acceptable\" than Hollywood or even \r\nmainstream indie cinema usually offers, and the film is most thrilling for that \r\nreason. The originality extends to the setting and how it's presented. Long sections of \"Tangerine\" consist of shots of people walking and walking and walking and walking to get anywhere in Los Angeles, sometimes after having waited on a bus that seemed as though it would never arrive, or taking a cab because they were too old or too drunk to drive their own vehicle, or because they don't have a vehicle, or can't have one. You almost never see a Los Angeles movie about people who don't own cars. This is a minor point in the movie's greater scheme, but it seems like one key to appreciating the movie's specialness.\u00a0  None of this should imply that the film is a flawless masterpiece. Like the \r\nrecent American indies \"Gabriel\" and \"Runoff,\" both of which I liked \r\nquite a bit, \"Tangerine\" has a brief running time but still feels padded\r\n in places. Some of the dialogue sounds too improvised (even if it was \r\nscripted). The ending seems to be aiming for a spectacular, screwball \r\nmeltdown, but it nearly implodes the movie, because it goes and on and on, and the various \r\nstorytelling threads that converge there haven't been properly guided \r\ntoward their supposedly inevitable collision. It often plays like an attempt to force coherence on an\r\n otherwise endearingly loose movie.  Advertisement And certain aspects of the story \r\nare\u2014as Internet thinkpieces are found of saying\u2014problematic, particularly the violence that Sin-Dee inflicts on Dinah, grabbing and dragging and lifting and even slapping her repeatedly, over the course of several scenes. \"Tangerine\" treats this action as outrageously funny; it seems to expect us to write it off as, \"Well, this is just what would happen in that world,\" a valid enough observation, but one that only takes us so far. True, the violence is balanced by subsequent scenes of Sin-Dee and Dinah and eventually Alexandra reaching a kind of understanding, and even displaying tenderness toward each other. But the later scenes don't cancel out the sour taste left by the earlier ones. This is a case where the problem isn't what's being shown, but the film's evident attitude toward what it's showing us, at the moment that it's showing it. That we rarely see transgender characters in movies who aren't prostitutes is an entirely separate issue that I'm sure will be discussed in months to come\u2014but here, too, we have to keep such misgivings in context: American films rarely show us worlds like these, and when they do, the films don't tend to get much attention.  If it were possible to time-warp \"Tangerine\" back a few decades, it could be part of that wave of indies that redefined American cinema \r\nin the eighties and nineties, with features like \"Go Fish,\" \"The Living \r\nEnd,\" \"Clerks,\"\u00a0 \"The Brother from Another Planet\" and \"She's Gotta Have It\"\u2014 works that, acting- and storytelling-wise, were rough around the \r\nedges, but compensated by depicting worlds rarely seen onscreen, with warmth and confidence. \"Tangerine\" has that kind of vitality. It turns murals and signage, palm trees and Spanish tiled strip-mall roofs into \"production value,\" and has the guts to let key scenes play out as silent montages scored to dreamy synthesized music cues, like something out a Michael Mann film. Sin-Dee and Alexandra and Dinah and Chester and Razmik are great characters, played by actors with tremendous energy. They seem to have existed before the opening credits rolled. After the closing credits have faded you'll think about them, and wonder how they're doing.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "London Town", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "For as many valid and well-reasoned arguments exist about how nostalgia is a spiritually and culturally ossifying force, human beings and the culture industry that pursues them can\u2019t seem to help the practice. Of all the bands that emerged during the U.K.\u2019s punk rock years, The Clash was perhaps the most explicitly anti-nostalgia; the entire point of the songs was a here-and-now anger. This extended from the no-Elvis-no-Beatles-no-Stones new rule of its single \u201c1977\u201d to the 1981 simulated emergency broadcast of \u201cThis Is Radio Clash.\u201d By pointing this out I don\u2019t mean to suggest that The Clash\u2019s music has no validity when heard in 2016. But it signifies very differently. Advertisement In any event, the particularity of what the band did in the late 1970s makes the nostalgic spectacle of \u201cLondon Town\u201d kind of curious. The movie, directed by Derrick Borte from a script by Matt Brown (adapting a prior project written by Sonya Gildea and Kirsten Sheridan, and no, these kinds of pass-the-conceptual-football writing credits never really bode well, do they) gets the music pretty well, even as it fudges some release dates. But the movie\u2019s impersonal, conventional telling of a reasonably standard male coming-of-age story almost tends to make the punk milieu it depicts beside the point.  As the movie opens, Shay (Daniel Huttlestone), a fellow in his early teens who wears flared pants that are at least four years behind the times even by 1977 standards, feels oppressed in his just-outside-of-London home, living with single dad Nick (Dougray Scott) and a little sister. He gets a letter and a cassette tape from his mum, who\u2019s apparently swinging in London, punk style. A few tentative forays to the big city find Shay romancing a sassy punkette named Vivian (Nell Williams), finding that his mum\u2019s communal lifestyle is somewhat more rough and ready than is appropriate for a 15-year-old, and being counseled by Joe Strummer himself, a fellow who seems to turn up in the most unlikely places. For instance, as a fare in Shay\u2019s father\u2019s cab, which Shay is driving, in drag.  It\u2019s a long story, tied up with his dad\u2019s hospitalization after an accident and the subsequent economic doom it portends. While trying to stave off disaster, Shay also experiences the exhilaration of being young and idealistic and in love and actually attending Clash rehearsals. In the hands of more distinctive filmmakers this might come off, but the approach here is indie-slick and impersonal. Which, among other things, underscores just what a boring readymade character young Shay is. When he discovers that Vivian\u2019s home environment is quite a bit posher than she\u2019s let on, he responds with a hissy fit of ugly sexism that you just know is going to be forgiven by both Vivian and the film before the final credits. This might be realistic, but it\u2019s also boring and stale. The portrayal of Strummer by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (who has a history of portraying rockers simultaneously iconic and iconoclastic; see \u201cVelvet Goldmine\u201d) is, I suppose, an interesting rethink of Strummer\u2019s micromanaged guttersnipe charisma. But it\u2019s one that would have been more interesting in a better film. Advertisement As it happens, in 1980 Jack Hazan and David Mingay directed a picture called \u201cRude Boy,\u201d about a genuinely lumpen young man who hangs out around The Clash long enough to become a roadie for the band. It\u2019s not a good film per se but it\u2019s authentically grungy and purposefully uningratiating, and the band members, playing themselves, have the honesty to depict themselves as not-entirely-nice guys throughout. Not louts, but working performers who can\u2019t be around to hold anyone else\u2019s hand, to say the least. It might make an instructive double feature with this film, which is a confection by comparison.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Where everything is bad, it must be good to know the worst.\" The British philosopher F.H. Bradley wrote that, and while he was surely not referring to the relative glut of bad movies that American distributor dump into theaters during the six-to-eight week winter/awards season lull at the beginning of each year, such is the state of things that while it may indeed be good to know the worst, it's kind of difficult to tell. There's also a kind of inverse correlative possible: with so much bad, how can you tell what's good?  Advertisement On the face of things, a studio reboot of the late writer Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character, a sort of American James Bond for the neocon/family values set, seems like an opportunistic and banal idea. And for the first minutes of \"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,\" which rewrites the Ryan origin story by placing the young character in the London School of Economics for the terror attack of 9/11, opportunism and banality go hand in hand with nary a care in the world, it seems. Things get less blithe, and a little shaky, when appealing, square-jawed, eagle-eyed Chris Pine's undercover C.I.A. fiscal analyst Ryan is pairing off romantically with what seems to be a severely miscast Keira Knightley, who, try as she might, doesn't quite make it as a wholesome, uncomplicated young American woman of substantial backbone. So my question during the initial part of the movie was, \"Just how bad will this be?\"  But then something interesting (and pretty rare) happens: the movie finds its feet, and unrolls as a pretty suspenseful, largely engaging, and hardly ever too-over-the-top spy thriller. Once Ryan finds himself in Moscow, investigating what looks to him like a conspiracy to sink the U.S. dollar (you can tell this movie is a fantasy because as the plot proper unfolds one character refers to our native currency's \"strong performance\"), the ex-Marine finds himself back in action, and a fight scene that quotes purposefully from both \"From Russia With Love\" and \"Torn Curtain\" gets the adrenaline up. The presence of Russian villains suggests a certain Cold War nostalgia, at least as far as plot-point potential is concerned, on the part of screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp. On the other hand, maybe they're just spy movie classicists.\u00a0In any event, director Kenneth Branagh casts himself as one of them, and boy does he have a devil of a time playing chilly, drug-addicted psychopath financier Viktor Cherevin. (Mikhail Baryshnikov also seems to enjoy his role as an old-school Kremlin cardinal.) Also adding a good deal of juice is a straight-backed, just-offhand enough Kevin Costner as Ryan's spymaster. After Knightley's curious Cathy follows Ryan to Moscow and obliges him to blow his cover (I assume you're all familiar with the covert-C.I.A.-agent-drill in Popular Cinema by now), it's all in for a quasi-\"Mission Impossible\" style breach of Cherevin's corporation (whose logo bears a striking resemblance to that of Enron, oddly enough), to stop not just a fiscal disaster but a new terrorist attack on American soil. Yes, the movie does pack in a lot of plot, and as you may have inferred, much of said plot is pretty derivative (the talk early on of a controversial oil pipeline will ring \"The World Is Not Enough\" bells for spy movie mavens). Derivative doesn't mean dumb, though (okay, it doesn't mean \"too dumb\"), and what the movie lacks in originality the cast and the director make up for in sheer let-us-entertain-you enthusiasm. Knightley eventually finds her footing\u2014largely when she's left alone with Branagh, and their respective characters can cagily chat about Lermontov, as British thespians so often do among themselves. And while the movie does eventually trot out the too-common commonplaces of the damsel in distress and the ticking time bomb for the climax and grand finale, it plays those tropes with what passes for discretion in contemporary action movies. In short, a spy movie that will satisfy if you happen to be in the mood for one. Which in January constitutes something of a minor miracle.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Pacific Rim Uprising", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "I'm writing this review in a hurry because every hour I wait makes it harder to remember \"Pacific Rim Uprising.\"\u00a0 On a craft level, this sequel to Guillermo del Toro's monsters-versus-biomechanical warriors saga \"Pacific Rim\" isn't terrible. At the very least, it doesn't stint on images of huge things crashing into other huge things, as well as collateral damage in the form of cratering streets, collapsing buildings, and panicked civilians (who are shown racing away from the mayhem but rarely being hurt or killed). Set ten years later, the movie showcases giant gundam, or j\u00e4gers, fighting a new kind of kaiju (I won't go into details because it would spoil one of the film's only surprises) and, for variety, j\u00e4gers battling other j\u00e4gers. Younger kids might like it, and it's probably a safer bet for that age group than the \"Transformers\" films, which are strangely filled with racist and sexist images as well as a needlessly sleazy undertone. Advertisement And the cast is filled with actors doing everything they can to make their characters as memorable as possible even when the script (credited to four people) isn't lending them the support they deserve. John Boyega, in particular, saves long stretches of the movie just by being his appealing self. Ever since \"The Force Awakens,\" he's been honing a screen persona that owes a lot to the late James Garner\u2014a funny, cynical survivor who makes a point of avoiding unnecessary fights and keeping one eye on the exit at all times, but who also has a buried streak of righteous honor that surfaces during dire moments. He's operating in that mode here, playing Jake Pentecost, the pilot-turned-scrapper son of the original film's inspirational warrior-guru Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). But there are two major problems, and the movie never manages to overcome either of them.  One is that the whole sequel storyline feels like a sad afterthought to the original, which saw various two-person crews of misfit eccentrics overcoming their animosities and neuroses to become one mind, operate their machines, and bash, smash and burn giant beasts who'd slipped through a dimensional portal at the bottom of the sea. To its credit, this sequel from director Steven S. DeKnight (TV's \"Spartacus\") doesn't just decide, \"Well, the portal that we thought we'd closed is open again, and there are more monsters, so everybody saddle up,\" because that would've been as lame as the plot of the\u00a0 \"Independence Day\" sequel. But what the movie does come up with has been built out in a halfhearted, clumsy manner that underlines the cynical nature of the exercise: a plot involving the rush to deploy j\u00e4ger drones overseen by the shadowy Shao Corporation, which has been getting a little too close to the kaiju brains that its top secret research depends on.  There are supporting turns by returning characters, including Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), the \"Pacific Rim\" pilot who subsequently became an important world leader, and oddball scientists Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) and Dr. Newt Geiszler (Charlie Day). The latter moves to the center of the story thanks to his kaiju mind-meld in the first film. Now he's the co-chief of the Shao Corporation's drone development program alongside Liwen Shao (Jing Tian of \"Kong: Skull Island\" and \"The Great Wall\"). While Day doesn't have the gravitas for what he's been asked to do here, his oddball intensity is a welcome contrast with the earnestness displayed elsewhere (Scott Eastwood's snarling pilot Nate Lambert being an especially one-note example). An orphaned  street urchin turned juvenile pilot named Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny) is also regrettably indistinct\u2014essentially a retread of Mako Mori with a few years knocked off her age, ready-made for big brother-little sister or surrogate father-daughter bonding.  It's not the actress' fault that the movie mistakes gritted teeth and cartoon spunk for a personality. Advertisement Which brings us to the second problem: no Del Toro. Even at their liveliest, these performers can only do so much without the originator at the helm. The project lacks the purplish intensity and explosions of juvenile poetry that made the original \"Pacific Rim\" so distinctive, whether you loved or hated it. I loved it. In fact, I like to tell people it's the \"Citizen Kane\" of movies where robots smash dinosaurs in the face with boats. That film's feverish commitment to every detail of the universe it created was admirable. From the names and powers it bestowed on its machines and creatures to the thought it put into what urban life and popular culture would look like in a world besieged by kaiju attacks, there was no doubt that it meant something to the people who made it. It was the work of true believers with childlike enthusiasm for the absurd. Del Toro even believed in the themes of personal redemption and collective effort that were baked into the details of the j\u00e4ger's mechanics.  He got high on his own supply, and not only was that forgivable, it was exactly what a filmmaker was supposed to do in that kind of circumstance. Here, with a few brief exceptions, it feels as if the studio and the filmmakers just held onto a lot of the CGI programs they'd used to create the effects in the original film and decided to give them one more lap around the track for box office's sake, while making a point of pandering to the Chinese market that made the original film an international success after it did disappointing business elsewhere. (There's nothing wrong with that last part, of course\u2014I only mention it because, once you've seen the movie, it seems like a far better explanation for why \"Uprising\" exists than anything supplied by the script.) The fate of the world has rarely been decided in as rote a manner as it is here, although I'll confess that the final act\u2014a battle climaxing on the crest of Mt. Fuji, site of many a showdown in a golden era Japanese monster flick\u2014has a flair for melodrama and grandiose imagery that the rest of the project sorely lacks.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Mummy", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "By now you\u2019ve probably read a number of scathing reviews of \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d Universal\u2019s inaugural entry in a possibly grievously ill-advised \u201cDark Universe\u201d franchise, wherein the legendary studio intends to reboot its most Famous Monsters of Filmland. Perhaps I\u2019m becoming jaded in my old age, but I was more amused than appalled.  Don\u2019t get me wrong. \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d directed (if that\u2019s what you want to call it; I honestly think the better term here is \u201costensibly overseen on behalf of the studio executives\u201d) by Alex Kurtzman from a script by David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie, and Dylan Kussman, has plenty to get irritated about. I got sand in my synapses during an early scene in which Tom Cruise, as a looter named Nick Morton (oh, \u201cMort,\u201d I get it now), and his sidekick, played by Jake Johnson, casually slaughter a bunch of \u201cIraqi insurgents\u201d trying to track down a mysterious treasure. Oh, sure, filmmakers, by all means use a tragic and unnecessary war that\u2019s still yielding horrific consequences for the world as the backdrop for your stupid horror movie plot machinations, no problem here. Advertisement And, of course, there\u2019s the movie\u2019s very old-school sexism. \"The Mummy\" has two female characters: One is corrupt albeit not unattractive ancient Egyptian royal Ahmanet, who, once freed from her tomb in the present day, is the incarnation of all evil and stuff. (She is played by Sofia Boutella, whose filmography testifies that she\u2019s accustomed to being ill-used in motion pictures). The other is faux-archeologist/genuine anti-evil secret agent Jenny (Annabelle Wallis) who\u2019s mainly around to be rescued by Nick, and whose surface venality suggests that his business card describes him as a \u201clovable rogue.\u201d  So yes, should one choose to take offense, one certainly may. But I have to be honest\u2014speaking of venality, I found something almost admirable about the film\u2019s cheek. It\u2019s amazingly relentless in its naked borrowing from other, better horror and sci-fi movies that I was able to keep occupied making a checklist of the movies referenced. At its opening, remnants of a past civilization are discovered while workmen are tunneling underground for a new subway route. That\u2019s from \u201cQuatermass and the Pit,\u201d aka \u201cFive Million Miles to Earth.\u201d As many other reviewers have noted, once Jake Johnson\u2019s character buys in and is reborn as a wisecracking undead sidekick warning Nick about how he\u2019s been cursed by incarnation-of-evil Ahmanet, it\u2019s \u201cAmerican Werewolf in London\u201d time, albeit with PG-13-rated special effects rather than the side of ketchup-dipped corned beef that fell from Griffin Dunne\u2019s face in the earlier movie. What else? A woman whose kiss drains the life force out of those who receive it, from the wacky space-vampire movie \u201cLifeforce\u201d? Check. A brain-draining insect in the ear from \u201cStar Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\u201d? Check. Spavined slapstick undead assaulters out of \u201cEvil Dead\u201d? Check. Underwater fights with the undead out of Lucio Fulci\u2019s \u201cZombie\u201d? Check. (These too are toned down considerably from the source material.) Someone saying \u201cPlans?\u201d with the precise intonation Sir Ralph Richardson used in \u201cTales from the Crypt\u201d? Also check. Don\u2019t even get me started on the, um, appropriation of a famous line from the Universal monster movie \u201cBride of Frankenstein.\u201d But that\u2019s life, and that movie literally IS Universal\u2019s property.  There have been a lot of crocodile tears already shed about the fact that The Mighty Tom Cruise has allowed himself to be used in such dreck, and also that Russell Crowe has been compelled to continue to sink into a form of self-parody by appearing as the head of Jenny\u2019s anti-evil agency, a character named Dr. Henry Jekyll, and yeah, it\u2019s the same guy. Or some iteration of the same guy. As it happens, Dr. Jekyll was never one of the Universal Studios monsters, but the character IS in the public domain, so I guess the corporate overlords of the Dark Universe figured \u201cwhat the you-know-what.\u201d\u00a0  Advertisement Anyway, I cannot feel too aggrieved for either star. As Richard Harris and Richard Burton found out for themselves many years before Crowe came along, there comes a time in the career of every loose-cannon macho actor where the any-port-in-a-financial-year-storm approach to career management is all for the best. As for Cruise, he is known for his try-anything-once sense of cinematic adventure, and he does like his franchises. The Morton character is admittedly more of a callow nothingburger than any he\u2019s played. And given how the movie ends I\u2019m a little disappointed that he wasn\u2019t named Larry Talbot. But who knows, maybe he\u2019ll be obliged to change it for the next installment. Which I am looking forward to, out of nothing but base curiosity.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Ride", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Helen Hunt's second film as a director, \"Ride,\" is about a brittle book editor who heals old wounds and her strained relationship with her son by learning to surf. From its opening scenes, it settles into what seems like a familiar if very specific comic mode exemplified by such filmmakers as Woody Allen, Nancy Meyers (\"Something's Gotta Give\") and James L. Brooks (\"Broadcast News\" and \"As Good as it Gets,\" for which Hunt won an Oscar).\u00a0 The characters in these movies tend to be white, American, upper-middle class to rich, educated, and nervously talkative, and the whole thing tends to be pitched somewhere between a TV sitcom and a laid-back American indie film in which nothing too terribly upsetting happens onscreen. Lessons are learned, loves lost or found, quotable lines uttered, roll credits. None of which is meant to denigrate the movies as unworthy: well-done, they can be incredibly satisfying, and it's questionable whether they're any more or less trivial than a superhero film or \"Godzilla\" in the greater scheme (at least you get to see a version of the actual world on a movie screen). Just that usually you go in having a pretty good idea what you're in for, and you're rarely proven wrong. Advertisement \"Ride,\" though, is a somewhat different animal. Hunt, who directs her own original screenplay, nails the Allen-Meyers-Brooks aspect of the film from the opening scene, in which her heroine Jackie banters with her college-bound son Angelo (Brenton Thwaites) about a short story he's written. The rat-a-tat rhythm of the dialogue, complete with people talking over and past each other, is highly structured, every word and pause carefully chosen to put across a particular rhythmic or emotional effect. Nobody's just winging it here. The rest of the setup for the story is similarly meticulous, with dialogue scenes and bits of physical comedy blocked as meticulously as anything you might see in a Broadway play (one of the cleverest is the scene where Angelo allays his mom's fears that he's moving too far away from her by walking her across the park, counting each step along the way). We deduce that this is a movie about learning to let go, with an empty nest story at its center, and we figure it'll manifest itself by showing us that Jackie is a control freak, like a lot of older rom-com heroines, and that her son chafes at that even though he obviously has a touch of it himself, and that they're both going to have to get used to the idea of not being in each other's lives 24/7. But then Angelo goes to Venice, California to visit his father and his new family one last time before college and impulsively decides to drop out and just hang around the beach. Suddenly the whole temperament of the film changes, and you start to figure out that the tight-knit relationship between a single mother and her only son is not the main story here, but a gateway into the real main story. Suffice to say that once \"Ride\" gets around to explaining why Jackie and Angelo are so incredibly, perhaps unhealthily close (bickering and swapping in-jokes like a brother and sister, or an old married couple) and then has Jackie decide to stay in Venice for a while and learn to surf and open some long-locked doors in her psyche, the film goes darker than you expected it to go; but it explores that darkness with a plainspokeness that goes up to the edge of agonized psychodrama but somehow never punctures that feeling that Hunt established early on. This is a remarkable feat that required keen instincts to pull off. It's as if somebody had spliced bits of a French art house drama about grief, suffering and repression into \"Spanglish\" or \"It's Complicated,\" without one aspect canceling out the other. The film is high-strung, nervous and slightly chilly in the New York scenes, but once the action shifts to the beaches of Venice, it slows down considerably, and fittingly; the rhythm of the waves dictates the pace and color of the movie, and it makes sense to apply the brakes to a story about a woman who's always talking and working and running all over the place and defining and ranking and describing everything in her life. (Complaining about LA, she says, \"By the time you drive to a museum, you've lost the will to look at a painting, so it's hardly a decision based on culture\").  Advertisement The slowing-down effect of Venice makes it possible for Jackie to actually live in reality rather than hurrying through it or avoiding it. This in turn encourages her to confront the real reason she's so controlling towards Angelo and so incapable of letting him go. Without giving away the movie's big reveal (it's horrifying, in an everyday sort of way, but not \"surprising\" in a movie way) I can say that once we face it along with Jackie and Angelo and their loved ones, the film seems to go through much the same revelatory experience that Jackie has on the beach as she learns how to ride a board with help from a handsome, slightly younger instructor and soon-to-be-love-interest named Ian (Luke Wilson). It chills out and loosens up. And then it goes deep\u2014deeper than you expected\u2014into pain. There's a long, wordless sequence out in the ocean, just Hunt on a surfboard, that has the ritualistic power of a sacrament.  \"Ride\" isn't going to win any prizes for cinematic innovation. Its comfort in privilege has an irritatingly unexamined quality (Jackie's got the sort of job where she can fly cross-country for several days and drive to and from the beach in a limo and not be fired immediately). And there are aspects that feel more generous than dramatically wise, such as most of the scenes involving Angelo in LA; I think it would've been all right to let him be a supporting character after the film leaves New York and slip toward the margins of the story, which is mainly Jackie's. Still, this is an unusual movie, especially when you look back and realize how usual it seemed going in.  Certain actors seem to understand their screen persona better than almost any director they've worked with. Hunt might be one of them. She's often been cast as a killjoy, a micro-manager, a voice of reason, or a somewhat abstract figure of mystery and longing, and she's written a part for herself that incorporates all of those shards. (\"It sounds like hubris, but I know that once I get out there I am going to be better than average at intuiting how to do this,\" she says, explaining why she doesn't want surfing lessons at first.) But there's an earthier, warmer figure buried just beneath Jackie's surface, and the movie digs her out in a disarmingly natural way. Jackie can get high and laugh endlessly at a completely innocuous question, or march into her ex-husband's house and have a tearful meltdown that's been a long time coming while being keenly aware of how inappropriate and selfish it is, to the point of preemptively describing what she thinks the other characters in the room are thinking and feeling about her.  Advertisement The movie is funny until suddenly it's not funny at all. Then it's funny again while discussing the fact that some things really aren't funny. And near the end, it's affecting without seeming to try to hard to be affecting. A lot of this has to do with the way Hunt invests ordinary words with strong emotion by having the characters deliver them in an offhand way. \"Life is long,\" Ian tells Jackie. \"It is,\" she replies. I hope a lot of people see this movie. It's not great, but it has greatness in it, and as a filmmaker, Hunt is the real deal.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Queen of Katwe", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Director Mira Nair introduced her thoroughly crowdpleasing \u201cQueen\r\nof Katwe\u201d on Saturday night at the Toronto International Film Festival by quoting the slogan\r\nof a film school she has founded in Uganda, where she lives: \u201cIf we don\u2019t tell\r\nour own stories, no one will.\u201d That sense of ownership and authorship permeates \u201cQueen of Katwe,\u201d elevating it above your average feel-good biopic and allowing\r\nits message to feel not only inspirational but genuine. The story of Phiona\r\nMutesi is a fascinating one on its own, but what could have just been an\r\nextended \u201c30 For 30\u201d feels lived-in, compassionate and truthful. It helps\r\ngreatly to have not only Nair\u2019s clear love for her country guiding every\r\ndecision but also the amazing depth of David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong\u2019o to\r\nground it from most of its sentimental clich\u00e9s. Some of the dialogue in the\r\nfinal act feels a little false and manipulative, but those scenes stand out because it\u2019s been so believable up to that point.\u00a0 Advertisement The nuanced, subtle newcomer Madina Nalwanga plays\r\n10-year-old Phiona Mutesi, a young lady who lives in the slum of Katwe in\r\nKampala, Uganda. She has almost no possessions, can\u2019t read and sells maize in\r\nthe street to try to scrape together change for her family, which includes two\r\nbrothers, a sister, and her headstrong mother Harriet (Nyong\u2019o). Phiona and her\r\noldest brother Brian (Martin Kabanza) cross paths with a local sports ministry head named\r\nRobert Katende (Oyelowo). Recognizing that the slum kids he\u2019s working with\r\naren\u2019t going to compete at football, he decides to teach them something he\r\nmastered at a young age, the art of chess. It\u2019s a game that equalizes issues of\r\nclass, education and income. It can be played by anyone in the world, and\r\nKatende soon realizes that this young girl from Katwe has a special gift,\r\nespecially when she starts beating him. It\u2019s to be expected that the education segments of \u201cQueen of\r\nKatwe\u201d include a number of nods to how the game reflects Phiona\u2019s life, but\r\nthe execution doesn't feel heavy-handed. Nair is confident enough in her characters and\r\nthe story she\u2019s telling to avoid the pitfalls of repetitive lessons. So we get\r\nthe idea that Phiona likes the act of \u201cQueening\u201d because a pawn makes it all\r\nthe way across the board, against all odds, and becomes a Queen. We don\u2019t\r\nhear it 15 times like we would in a lesser film. When Katende explains the idea\r\nof finding a \u201csafe space\u201d whenever your opponent is on the offensive, it\u2019s easy to\r\ntranslate that to Phiona\u2019s real life but the movie doesn\u2019t hammer it in. This\r\nsubtle touch is undermined a bit in the final act as issues of Phiona\u2019s success\r\nand class conflicts start to tear the family apart in a way that feels manipulative\r\nand melodramatic, but Nair recovers by the end. Two of the reasons she manages to get the film back from the\r\nedge of treacle are right there in David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong\u2019o. The \u201cSelma\u201d\r\nstar is as charismatic as ever, capturing the kindness of a man who saw a\r\npotential escape for a young lady and did whatever he could to make it happen.\r\nOyelowo\u2019s work here is subtle but so consistent. He never looks like he\u2019s\r\nworking the message of the film more than the character he\u2019s playing. Opposite\r\nhim, Nyong\u2019o is phenomenal. She has an incredible ability to convey backstory.\r\nWe believe Harriet isn\u2019t merely a sounding board for our heroine or an\r\nemotional plot device. She feels real because of the intense passion that Nyong\u2019o\r\nbrings to her. And it\u2019s in the subtle things, like a glance that conveys fear about her family\u2019s future or the different tone she takes with each of her\r\nchildren. One also shouldn\u2019t miss how good Nalwanga is here, giving a fluid and physical performance. Advertisement Of course, much of the credit should go back to Nair and her\r\ntechnical team, who capture the streets of Uganda in a way we haven\u2019t really\r\nseen before, certainly not in a Disney film (Nair joked in the intro that it\r\nwas the first Disney film set in Africa that doesn\u2019t have a single animal in\r\nit). From the way Nair and her designer use costumes to convey economic status to how the great cinematographer Sean Bobbitt (\u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d) fluidly\r\ncaptures a corner of the world that makes it feel specific, \u201cQueen of Katwe\u201d is a team effort. With the combined efforts of Nalwanga,\r\nNair, Nyong\u2019o, Oyelowo, Bobbitt and many more, \u201cQueen of Katwe\u201d makes it clear\r\nthat we can\u2019t successfully tell \u201cour stories\u201d alone.

{"Title": "Playing It Cool", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Films about writers are tough enough. Films about writers\r\nwho think they\u2019re the smartest person in the room and too cool for the love story\r\nin which they\u2019re essentially starring are even more ill-advised. Such is one of\r\nthe many problems with \u201cPlaying It Cool\u201d, a movie that suffers greatly from its\r\ntendency to constantly remind you that \u201cThis is a Film About WRITERS.\u201d Our narrator\r\nnot only comments on the action of the piece incessantly, he\u2019s credited as \u201cMe\u201d.\r\nAnd the narcissism doesn\u2019t stop there. This \u201cMe\u201d constantly reminds us about\r\nhow differently writers see the world, how idiosyncratic they are, how smart\r\nthey are, how much better they are than you, etc. It\u2019s like being stuck in the head of a Creative Writing student who looks down on everyone else's major.\r\nAnd the film ultimately falls victim to the false assumption that highlighting clich\u00e9s\r\nmakes them easier to bear, when, in fact, I find the opposite true. Embrace\r\nyour manipulation, don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re above it before you use it. Only the\r\nreally strong cast, including great chemistry between the leads, keeps \u201cPlaying\r\nIt Cool\u201d from totally derailing. Advertisement Chris Evans plays the narrator, a lovelorn, one-night stand\r\ntype whose mom left him years ago with a note on the Cap\u2019n Crunch and whose\r\nheart isn\u2019t just on his sleeve, it\u2019s taken form and follows him around,\r\nchain-smoking. Then, of course, he gets smacked in the face with love when he\r\nmeets \u201cHer,\u201d played by the lovely Michelle Monaghan. It wouldn\u2019t be a movie if\r\nour object of desire was single, and so we get an uptight beau named \u201cStuffy\u201d\r\n(Ioan Gruffudd) to eventually overcome. More problematic for our hero is the\r\nfact that he doesn\u2019t really believe in the love in which he\u2019s falling. He talks\r\nthrough his concerns with writer friends Scott (Topher Grace), Lyle (Martin\r\nStarr), Mallory (Aubrey Plaza), and Samson (Luke Wilson)\u2014a group of characters\r\nso poorly realized that I started to wonder if they weren\u2019t all figments of our\r\nwriter\u2019s imagination.  \u201cPlaying It Cool\u201d is so self-consciously trying to convince\r\nviewers that it\u2019s the smartest romantic comedy in years that it never bothers\r\nto create characters. I\u2019m sure writer/director Justin Reardon thought he was\r\nbeing clever in his construction (unnamed characters who constantly comment on\r\ntheir own clich\u00e9d situations) but the result is an annoyingly pretentious piece\r\nof work. There\u2019s more \u201ccommentary\u201d about writing and love in \u201cPlaying It Cool\u201d\r\nthan actual romance or friendship. It defiantly fails the \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d\r\nargument. It is all telling. Which adds to how remarkable it is that Evans and Monaghan\r\nkeep the film from becoming totally unbearable. He\u2019s likely to always be most\r\nfamous for Captain America, but I\u2019ve always found him a likable actor\u2014believable,\r\ncharismatic, smart. Evans is up for anything. It\u2019s Reardon\u2019s fault that he\r\ndoesn\u2019t give him anything consistent to do. Evans\u2019 writer is a total narcissist\u2014he\r\nliterally puts himself in the leading roles of every story his writer friends tell\r\nhim. Lovely, right? And yet Evans is too likable to make this guy the total\r\nasshole he probably would be in real life. Similarly, while we never quite\r\nunderstand what Monaghan would see in him besides the physical, she\u2019s a typical\r\ndelight. She\u2019s another actress I\u2019d love to see get better work.

{"Title": "Concussion", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cI am the wrong person to have discovered this,\u201d Dr. Bennet Omalu, played in this movie by Will Smith, laments to his wife Prema, near the final quarter of \"Concussion.\" Omalu, a practitioner who has such pride in his profession that he corrects people who refer to him as \u201cMister\u201d with \u201cDoctor,\u201d but who is so kind-hearted, brilliant, enthusiastic and likable that the tic doesn\u2019t play here as irritating, is in an unusually American fix in this fact-based drama.\u00a0 \n Omalu is the real-life doctor who, while working as a forensic pathologist in Pittsburgh, discovered a new and terrifying brain disorder that he named Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. He discovered it performing an autopsy on a retired Pittsburgh Steeler named Mike Webster (movingly portrayed here by David Morse). Webster left the game as a hero and began losing his mind well before his death at fifty; scenes shortly before his death show him living in his pickup truck, huffing turpentine. A fellow player, himself to suffer a similar fate in the movie, tries to help him out. Neither man understands what\u2019s happening to them. Omalu figures it out:\u00a0 the persistent head injuries sustained in football play shake up the brain\u2014as the character explains, unlike some other mammals, humans don\u2019t have built-in shock absorbers for their grey matter\u2014and release a protein that builds up and causes hallucinations, memory loss, and much more trauma.\u00a0 Advertisement \n This film, written and directed by Peter Landesman and based in part on a 2009 magazine article, portrays Omalu as a cheerful, quietly religious man who, as a Nigerian-born immigrant, believes strongly in the American Dream, and believes that doing the right thing is part of that whole trip. The response his findings elicit from the NFL quickly prove him mistaken. As Omalu\u2019s boss and mentor, played by Albert Brooks with a nice mix of world-weariness and faith, puts it, Omalu is going up against an organization that \u201cowns a day of the week.\u201d Omalu thinks the NFL will be glad of his findings, and use some American ingenuity to do something about the problem. This is not what occurs. \n Will Smith\u2019s performance as Omalu is lovely: small-scaled, precise, imbued with righteousness but not tritely pious. One thing I\u2019ve noticed when Smith essays such a performance in a movie that\u2019s not entirely bad (and this movie is rather good): my fellow critics seem a little surprised. I don\u2019t understand why. Even since before his first \u201cserious\u201d film, an adaptation of the acclaimed stage play \u201cSix Degrees Of Separation,\u201d he was clearly a gifted and versatile performer. Although his career in recent years has admittedly encompassed a lot of work in which he more or less merely has to \u201cbe Will Smith,\u201d that hasn\u2019t necessarily led to a diminishment of his chops. He\u2019s also surrounded by expert players, including Alec Baldwin as a one-time team doctor who\u2019s both disturbed and stimulated by Omalu\u2019s findings, and who tries to build a bridge between Omalu and the stonewalling NFL, an effort that ends in teeth-gritting frustration.\u00a0 \n The movie also depicts Omalu\u2019s personal life. You know that feeling when you have no social life because you\u2019re devoted to your work and your church, and some of the church elders ask you to provide a room from a recent immigrant from abroad, and that immigrant turns out to look just like Gugu Mbatha-Raw? No, I don\u2019t either. But that\u2019s what happens to Smith\u2019s character, and soon enough Mbatha-Raw\u2019s character, Prema, is more than a roommate. The movie treats the couple\u2019s relationship, and their strong faith, with refreshing delicacy and respect. And Mbatha-Raw makes Prema more than a long-suffering helpmate as the hostility against Omalu and his findings begins to mount.\u00a0 Advertisement \n The movie is engaging and fascinating for much of its two hours. The editing, by Oscar-winner William Goldenberg (he won for \u201cArgo\u201d and also put together \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d for which he was also nominated), is brisk and inventive, managing to imbue excitement into montages in which Omalu is doing nothing more pulse-pounding than looking at a bunch of slides. Once Omalu finds fans, players, and the football industry itself giving him the very aggressive side-eye, the narrative begins to diffuse a bit. The movie isn\u2019t shy about implicating that NFL chief Roger Goodell (played here by Luke Wilson) is a corporate weasel and liar. But as certain bad things begin happening around Omalu and his colleagues and his wife, things grow vague; the movie, I suppose, can\u2019t just come out and SAY that the NFL is willing and able to do stuff that skirts \u201cParallax View\u201d/\u201dThree Days of the Condor\u201d territory. I found that this possibly involuntary discretion worked to the movie\u2019s advantage; the non-ratcheting up of the drama somehow made the story feel more true, more honest. The real story, in a sense, is how Omalu\u2019s belief in the goodness of some institutions came under assault, and how he refused to become a cynic even after all that. When he\u2019s called an American hero near the end of the movie, the truth of that phrase, as well as all the contradictions that trail in its wake, are vividly felt.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Endless", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "If you have a good idea, a strong cast, a smart script, and directorial chops, you don't need a lot of money to make a compelling movie. \"The Endless\" is proof.\u00a0Overseen by the filmmaking team of Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead\u2014who specialize in brainy meta-horror, and who star as brothers who decide to revisit the UFO cult where they grew up\u2014this is a movie that plays with our perceptions of time, space, and reality, and\u00a0sketches the outlines of unimaginable terror while leaving the details to our imagination.\u00a0 Advertisement Like much of the cast, Benson and Moorhead play characters who share the performers'\u00a0real-life first names\u2014a common indie filmmaking affectation that wouldn't raise an eyebrow if this were a drama, but that adds one more layer of oddness in a science-fiction film. Justin is the older brother, Aaron the younger. They grew up in a compound in a hilly stretch of forest somewhere in Southern California (the movie was shot near San Diego). The story begins with Justin and Aaron living an anonymous life as regular citizens. The opening scenes reveal that Justin \"rescued\" Aaron and took both of them out of\u00a0the cult. Then Aaron watches a videotaped message from a once-fellow cult member, Callie Hernandez's Anna, and realizes he misses the place even though he knows it was bad for him. He tells Justin that he\u00a0wants to go back for \"closure.\" Justin thinks this is a bad idea but agrees, out of love for his brother and because, on some deep level, he misses it, too. Things get weird before the brothers even reach the compound, thanks to an atmosphere of mystery and menace realized with clever sound design, a synthesized score (by James Lavelle) that samples \"House of the Rising Sun\" and evokes the best of John Carpenter; and unexplained images that recur. This story is filled with circles, and circles within circles. Or maybe we should call them \"saucer shapes.\" There's an overcast sky with a hole punched through the clouds; round wind chimes clinking in in the breeze; wooden benches arranged around a campfire. Circles are embedded into\u00a0the score itself: \"House of the Rising Sun\" is built around a series of circular chord patterns, and the\u00a0lyrics are about a gambler's son who escaped an abusive childhood but seems determined to repeat his father's sins by choice.\u00a0Mirrors are as important, too.\u00a0There are actual mirrors in the film, mirrored compositions, characters whose fates or personalities seem to mirror each other, and moments where the universe seems to tear a hole in itself and show us what's on the other side.\u00a0 Things become unmoored from scientifically verifiable truth. We enter the psychic terrain of horror films that make us doubt our perceptions. There are so many strange moments and images, most of them tossed-off, that if you list them all without context, as I'm doing here, it sounds as if your brain is fragmenting. Which, of course, is the point of telling the story as Benson and Moorehead tell it: form follows function here, and the subject is the way cult brainwashing and isolation combine to destroy the ability to distinguish fantasy from reality.  Advertisement Characters keep taking trips of various distances (anywhere from hundreds of miles to a few feet) only to end up where they started. Sometimes they experience and re-experience the same events from the same angle, or a slightly different angle. Do they have free will, or did their psychological conditioning by the cult turn that into one more illusion, like the strange images they encounter around the camp?\u00a0Do they make choices, or do choices make them? The cult prides itself on having no leader, but is this true? There's a quiet, reactive fellow named Tim (Lew Temple) who has a bushy red beard, long red hair, an angular face, and the authoritative demeanor of a tribal chief. He's pictured standing beside the door of a shack that's been sealed with a huge, 19th-century looking padlock: nobody ever goes in there. There are throwaway lines about how particular characters in the film are a lot older than Aaron and Justin, even though they're played by actors their age or slightly younger.\u00a0  I'm being vague about the plot on purpose, because it's ultimately not the main focus of \"The Endless,\" and because so much\u00a0of the film's effectiveness comes from comparing what we're told would happen against what actually does happen (or what appears to happen). The circular visual motifs and circular (or repetitive) plotting evokes films that examine karma, evolution, free will and destiny by confronting their characters with variations of the same challenges over and over again: think of\u00a0\"Edge of Tomorrow,\" \"Groundhog Day\" and \"Looper.\"  The film seems to be set sometime before or immediately after the dawn of the 21st century, judging from the video technology and flip phones and apparent lack of Internet access, but we can't be sure.\u00a0As the movie goes on, even older technology starts to appear, some of it so visibly filthy or damaged (or so divorced from necessary accessory tech, such as as batteries or cords) that there's no way it could work; but of course it does work, conveying messages that seem generated by malevolent forces. A simple card trick that Justin smugly sees through gives way to a trick involving a baseball, so impervious to rational explanation that it chills the blood. And let's not get into the trip the brothers take in a rowboat, or the uncanny events that seem to occur whenever\u00a0Justin goes running.  Advertisement All of the lead performances are superb. The best are probably Moorhead; Benson; Hernandez; Kira Powell as the kind of glassy-eyed kook that Shelly Duvall used to specialize in; and James Jordan as a Dennis Hopper-like babbling lunatic named Shitty Carl. But it's hard to choose. Everybody's giving their all here. And the blatantly \"big\" performance moments are balanced out by numerous, just-right grace notes, such as the teasing, familiar, brotherly way that Justin and Aaron talk to each other, and the zonked-out, practically affectless way Powell's character corrects Justin, telling her that a meth-head hermit she just described to him wasn't a boyfriend, but \"just this guy I was sort of obsessed with, when I was on lithium, Thorazine and PCP.\" The filmmaking is mostly restrained and intelligent, strategically framing characters, moving the camera to reveal or conceal information, and amping up tension with surprising edits, dissonant sound effects, and Lavelle's music, which is so unsettling that I would not be surprised to learn that it was performed on a keyboard made from frayed human nerve endings. Not every moment in the film works: the lead actors overdo it a bit during the opening section, which unfortunately showcases some terrible, exposition-dump dialogue, and the CGI is dodgy in a way that's characteristic of moviemakers whose artistic ambitions exceed their budgets.\u00a0 But it's ultimately the suggestions, implications and shock effects that put the story over the top, as well as the emphasis on the characters' neuroses and longings. What these brothers are ultimately searching for is a place to call home. It doesn't matter to them if it's a cult compound full of deluded, psychologically destructive manipulators or some sort of intergalactic prison, torture compound or zoo (or whatever this place\u00a0is), as long as they know their way around, and are surrounded by faces they recognize.\u00a0The camp is their House of the Rising Sun.\u00a0These two have\u00a0one foot on the platform, the other on a train, and they've gone back to the compound to swing that ball and chain.

{"Title": "The Family I Had", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Katie Green & Carlye Rubin\u2019s \u201cThe Family I Had,\u201d which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and will air on Investigation Discovery\u00a0tomorrow night, December 21st, is an undeniable tragedy. What makes it a more interesting film than it might otherwise have been is its filmmakers willingness to recognize that there are no easy answers to questions that no one should ever have to ask. It is a story about a murder that tears a family apart and how the people who remain navigate an entirely different world than the one they were in the day before. And it presents an impossible situation for its central figure, someone who has to live the rest of her life with questions of regret and forgiveness that it\u2019s impossible to really even imagine considering much less finding the answers that would make one sleep easier at night. Advertisement That impossible situation belongs to Charity, a woman who was working her job at BW3s one night when she got a call that would forever change her life. Ella, her 4-year-old daughter, was dead. And her 13-year-old son Paris was being held for her murder. Paris had grabbed a knife and stabbed his sister to death, claiming on the 911 call that he believed the toddler was a demon (however, his own mother claims this story and the call are merely a story concocted by a boy, it\u2019s suggested, wasn\u2019t getting the attention he demanded). Immediately, Charity was faced with an impossible situation. As she says in heartbreaking interviews, if she tried to get Paris the help he so clearly needed, she wondered if she\u2019d be betraying the memory of Ella. But if your son was mentally ill, would you let the system lock him up and throw away the key?    Green and Rubin keenly understand the complexity of what they\u2019re covering. \u201cThe Family I Had\u201d is, thankfully, not an \u201cexplainer\u201d movie. It\u2019s not the kind of thing that\u2019s going to tell you exactly why Paris did what he did. Were his cries for attention ignored before that fateful night? What about his mother\u2019s substance abuse problems? What about the missing fathers in this narrative? What about cycles of emotional abuse? Or how our system really has no idea what to do with a sociopathic child, much less a single mother in Abilene, Texas? And then the narrative here takes a twist in the family tree that you won\u2019t see coming and offers another layer of debate to the nature vs. nurture issues at the core of this human tragedy.    And that\u2019s the key to this project\u2019s success\u2014the filmmakers never lose sight of the human beings looking for answers to impossible questions. Charity has another child after Paris goes into a system that will release him at the age of 33. She now has to worry about what Paris may do to her new child once he\u2019s out. Could he really do it again? Can you imagine watching someone who killed your child interact with another one? No, you can\u2019t. None of us can. And \u201cThe Family I Had\u201d recognizes the impossible situation in which Charity has been placed, and then memorably shows us how she has to move forward, one day at a time, one foot in front of the other.

{"Title": "The Family", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Life is tough in the Witness Protection Program. Life is pretty cushy, too, especially if you're the Manzoni family in Luc Besson's \"The Family\": you get to live in a quaint house in a tiny village in Normandy, you eat well, you have FBI guys stationed across the street 24/7, and you have a personal handler who makes sure that you and your loved ones are safe. The point of being in Normandy for the Manzonis is to somehow \"pass\" as regular Americans on holiday or sabbatical, and the Manzonis fail to manage this from the start, mainly because they are all raging maniacs.\u00a0 Advertisement \"The Family\" is a pretty uneven film, lurching from comedy to violence to sentiment, but it's best when it sticks in the realm of flat-out farce. The pleasure comes in watching the actors (Michelle Pfeiffer, in particular) submitting wholeheartedly to ridiculous situations. The film has a mix of influences and genres, obviously, and Besson plays with these and references them openly, but the farcical elements rest uneasily beside the violence, leaving the unmistakeable feeling that this is a film slightly at war with itself.\u00a0 When dealing with the family's adjustment (or lack thereof) to small-town French life, it is on sure (and often hilarious) footing.\u00a0Giovanni Manzoni (Robert De Niro) snitched on his Mafia friends back in the States, and because of that there is now a $20 million price on his head. In exchange for his testimony, he and his family (wife and two teenage kids, Belle and Warren) are placed in the Witness Protection Program, under the control of FBI agent Robert Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones). Maggie Manzoni (Pfeiffer) is already sick of the life in hiding, and has a tiny habit of blowing stuff up when she gets upset. Of course placing a well-known Mob boss into a tiny village in France doesn't seem like the best strategy for the FBI, because the witness will stick out even more there, but you really can't ask those questions when you watch \"The Family.\" The answers will not hold up under interrogation. The film opens with the family (Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Dianna Agron, and John D\u2019Leo) driving through the French countryside to yet another hideout since their cover was blown in the Riviera. The two kids loll bored in the back seat, Giovanni tries to tell everyone the new place will be fine, everything will be okay, the dog gets blamed for the bad smell in the car (when actually it is the stink of a dead corpse in the trunk, hidden there by Giovanni on his way out of Nice). This opening scene contains everything that is good and pleasurable about the film: watching Pfeiffer and De Niro act with one another, the weird juxtaposition of violence and everyday family matters, the family's anxiety at being in France when they'd rather be in Brooklyn. You are lulled into a false sense that you understand what is going on here\u2014that the father, Giovanni Manzoni (Robert De Niro) is the \"wise guy,\" and his family is just along for the ride. But the next couple of scenes explode that sense of safety (literally) as you realize that all of them, all four of them, are out of their minds.  Advertisement Belle and Warren size up their new small-town school and promptly begin to wreak havoc among their peer group. In a matter of days, Warren has taken over 50% of the blackmarket cigarette business, as well as the prescription pill business, and when he is told by a teacher that his conduct has been poor, he says he wants a lawyer. On her first day, Belle accepts a ride home with four French guys who tell her they want to \"practice their English,\" and when she realizes that maybe they want more from her, she beats one of the guys to a pulp with a tennis racket. Played by \"Glee\"'s Dianna Argon, Belle is a creepy character, gorgeous and innocent, but when she falls in love with her math tutor, you can't get the image of her smashing the tennis racket into another human being's face out of your mind. Meanwhile, Warren and Belle's parents are oblivious to what's happening in their children's lives. Giovanni thinks he might try his hand at a memoir, not a smart move for someone who is supposed to be in hiding. Maggie visits a local church, trying to re-connect to her faith. \u00a0Tommy Lee Jones shows up now and then to say it's hard to protect them if they insist on breaking the plumber's legs because he can't fix the pipes.  De Niro could play this role in his sleep, but he's fun to watch, especially in the scenes with Pfeiffer, and when his power is demeaned by his family's shenanigans. In one awesome sequence, the curator of a local film group calls up Giovanni and asks if he wouldn't come to their next meeting to have a nice debate on a great American film, Vincente Minnelli's \"Some Came Running\" (starring Frank Sinatra as an aspiring writer with a tormented past). Against the advice of Stansfield, Giovanni accepts. The head of the film society tells him they were sent \"Goodfellas\" by mistake, so maybe the visiting American would have something to say about that? Boy, does he ever. It's a giant wink to the audience, an inside joke, as we are treated to the bizarre vision of Robert De Niro as Giovanni Manzoni watching Robert De Niro as Jimmy in \"Goodfellas.\"  Pfeiffer's performance is the reason to see the film, though. Calling back her show-stopping turn in \"Married to the Mob,\" her Maggie is both supportive and bored out of her mind, yearning towards her old Catholic faith but unrepentant about blowing stuff up. She cooks at the stove, her hair in gigantic curlers. She kneels in church, praying to Jesus with earnest eyes. Pfeiffer has been very good in dramatic material, but she might be a comedienne at heart. There's one scene near the end of \"The Family\" where events are coming to a boil, buildings are exploding, and she crawls across the floor as quickly as she can clutching a gigantic kitchen knife. Her eyes are manic, wild, and yet also focused, like an assassin's.\u00a0 Luc Besson has built a career on stylish and thrilling action films, and \"The Family\" is a mess compared to such earlier efforts as \"Le Femme Nikita\" and \"L\u00e9on: The Professional.\" But for what it is, it works, while reminding us and again to not take it too seriously.

{"Title": "The Case Against 8", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"The Case Against 8,\" opening in limited release theatrically before an HBO debut on June 23, 2014, bears no pretense of objectivity. Look at the title. While it may not present \"both sides of the story,\" it thoroughly fulfills the promise of its title in presenting the legal battle against Proposition 8, the attempt to ban same-sex marriage in California. With remarkable access to the plaintiffs and legal team over the course of the five-year battle for equality, \"The Case Against 8\" starts as a relatively straightforward historical document about the specifics of the case but becomes something much deeper, and more emotional in the telling. As so often happens with stories of international importance such as the Supreme Court ruling on Prop 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act, we often lose sight of the men and women involved. \"The Case Against 8\" beautifully reminds us of the human beings who opened up their lives to the world and became representatives for one of the most important movements for equal rights this country has ever seen. Advertisement In May 2008, the California Supreme court legalized marriage for same-sex couples. 18,000 couples were married over the next few months but the backlash was almost immediate. By November of that year, a proposition was on the ballot to define marriage exclusively as being that between a man and a woman. As the country celebrated the election of Barack Obama, Prop 8 passed with 52% of the vote, resulting in a state amendment and the dissolution of thousands of partnerships in the eyes of the law.  The response was as swift as those who mounted the Prop 8 campaign. Activist Chad Griffin formed the American Foundation for Equal Rights and a chance meeting brought aboard one of the most important allies in the case against 8, Ted Olson, the former solicitor general under President George W. Bush. Olson was the man who argued one of the most important cases in decades, the one that determined that Bush would become President over Gore when Florida proved they were generally incapable of determining who won their state\u2019s delegates. Getting a conservative icon like Olson on the side of the case against 8 was a galvanizing, attention-grabbing move that proved to be the right decision. Olson is a passionate, stunningly intelligent man, who happens to be a conservative that believes in not just the legal cause for gay marriage but that all loving couples have the right on a moral level as well. His closing argument in \"The Case Against 8\" is one of the most passionate and moving I\u2019ve ever heard. Watching Olson depose witnesses to such an intellectual degree that he sometimes turns them from \"Yes on 8\" supporters to his cause is one of the film\u2019s great joys. Gay rights are often presented in film as emotional, moral causes, but Olson proves that they\u2019re intellectual, legal ones as well, often by turning their opponents\u2019 own logic against them. Who better to work with Ted Olson than the man who opposed him in Bush v. Gore, the equally impressive David Boies? And now they needed plaintiffs. After the kind of interview/vetting process that is a key part of most political campaigns, enter Kris Perry & Sandy Stier and Jeff Zarillo & Paul Katimi. \"The Case Against 8\" directors Ben Cotner and Ryan White never lose sight of the legal drama that\u2019s unfolding but perfectly place it in a foundation that\u2019s relatably human. We meet Kris & Sandy\u2019s sons, who had to each individually agree to be a part of the case before their mothers would place that spotlight on their family. And we spend a lot of emotional time with Jeff & Paul, two men who just wanted to live their lives together but became focal points of an entire movement. One easily loses sight of how much pressure they must have felt to represent gay marriage as a whole. What if they had lost? Advertisement As we all know, they didn\u2019t. And \"The Case Against 8\" feels like a victory speech. It\u2019s a well-made, moving, informative history that I first worried was too soon to tell; historical documentaries often require a bit more time from the key events to really place them in context. However, as the final act of this HBO film proves, we\u2019ve come an amazingly long way since that day in 2008 when men and women voted against gay marriage. There\u2019s still a long way to go but \"The Case Against 8\" deftly and emotionally chronicles one of the most important legs of this journey for equality.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Fencer", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The extent to which American film practice continues to influence some sectors of overseas moviemaking is both impressive and a little dispiriting. \u201cThe Fencer,\u201d an Estonian/Finnish/German co-production whose story is based on a real-life sports figure and teacher, begins with its protagonist, Endel, on board a train; after he disembarks, the camera follows him from behind, and the director, Klaus H\u00e4r\u00f6, arranges a series of shots that keep the character\u2019s back in the same position in the frame as he moves from train station to an indoor corridor to another corridor and so on, until he reaches his final destination, an office where he\u2019s reporting for his new job. This kind of clever gesture has the redolence of indie flair; the soft lighting throughout is meant to evoke a certain nostalgia (despite the fact that the setting and period of the movie, Soviet Estonia in the early 1950s, is not one most who were there tend to be nostalgic about, although in fairness sometimes you never know), and when Endel sits before his interviewer, we know he\u2019s going to end up as the bad guy because the actor playing him looks rather like Dylan Baker and wears orange-rimmed round spectacles that practically scream \u201cobedient bureaucrat.\u201d  Advertisement \u201cThe Fencer\u201d is largely a quiet and understated movie. Endel, played by M\u00e4rt Avandi, has a lean and haunted look from the start. At his job interview, the school principal and eventual bad guy, Hendrik Toompere, notes that Endel, who\u2019s to be the new phys ed instructor at a secondary school in Haapsalu, has listed \u201cfencing\u201d as among his skills, and comments \u201cNot a sport for the working man.\u201d Endel agrees, but in his off hours, he gets in a little practice at the sport, and is soon spied doing so by one of his younger female students, who is intrigued. So Endel starts a fencing club at the school. He is initially frustrated: \u201cQuite frankly I\u2019m not good with children,\u201d he confides to Kadri (Ursula Ratasepp), a fellow teacher with whom he will, yes, become romantically involved. But he improves. And the kids improve. To one of them, Jaan, a fellow whose home life is constantly upended by KGB types coming to his house and taking away a family elder, he says \u201cI will make you a fencer.\u201d Things move along well enough until one of the students becomes aware of a school fencing tournament to be held in Leningrad. Which is where Endel came from, looking for a place to hide out. From what is hinted at first in an on-screen text before the narrative begins; Endel then explains his situation to Kadri.  But in this movie of story beats, this is the one where the protagonist must make the decision: whether to let down his kids by saving his own skin, or not. The beats that follow are predictable, albeit more understated than how they\u2019d play out in a \u201cKarate Kid\u201d film. But they\u2019re still the same beats, within a sport that the viewer may not be too familiar with but which director H\u00e4r\u00f6 distills to some cinematically-friendly basics so that the viewer might savor the emotional satisfaction of the likable characters\u2019 victories. Finally, to provide a requisite happier ending, the movie invokes the little-known Stalin\u2019s Death Loophole.  None of this is particularly difficult to watch; the cinematic competence, the sincerity with which the clich\u00e9s get served up, and so on, make a relatively smooth viewing experience. But they also render what would have been an at times harrowing real-life story into something safe and bland.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "McCanick", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "When\r\n fans of beloved character actor David Morse say that they wish he could\r\n star in his own movie, \"McCanick\" is not what they have in mind. As \r\ndirected by Josh C. Waller and written by Daniel Noah, the movie is a \r\ntedious, often incompetently assembled mass of cop-on-the-edge clich\u00e9s.\u00a0 Morse\r\n stars as the title character, a grizzled Philadelphia police detective.\r\n The movie follows McCanick over the course of a single workday, his \r\n59th\u00a0birthday, as he rampages through the city, busting heads and \r\nscreaming threats. In theory, this chaos is in service of tracking down a\r\n recently released felon named Simon Weeks (Cory Monteith), a street \r\nhustler whom McCanick put behind bars seven years earlier. But it's \r\nreally in service of standard-issue dirty cop mayhem. Advertisement As\r\n clumsily written flashbacks pile up, we piece together the bigger \r\npicture of McCanick's history with Weeks: they met while McCanick was \r\ninvestigating a politician's murder. McCanick's commanding officer \r\n(Ciaran Hinds) hints that sleeping dogs should be let lie, but McCanick \r\nwon't listen; we discover the terrible secret that binds McCanick to \r\nWeeks, but only after enduring a repetitive series of \"searing\" \r\nconfrontations between the hero and various perps, accomplices, and \r\nrandom citizens, including a scene in which McCanick intimidates a \r\nroomful of tough guys by playing \"spin the pistol.\" There's\r\n also an unremarkable mentor-pupil relationship, with McCanick training a\r\n handsome young patrolman (Mike Vogel) who does things by the book and \r\nis appalled by the hero's can't-make-an-omelette-without-breaking-skulls\r\n attitude. The movie seems content to alternate between imitating \"Bad \r\nLieutenant\" and imitating \"Training Day,\" minus the genuine spiritual torment \r\nof the former and the sleek preposterousness of the latter.\u00a0 With\r\n his menacing bulk and soulful eyes, Morse lends the material more \r\ndignity and heft than it deserves, and there are a few affecting moments\r\n between him and Monteith, who died of a heroin overdose last year at \r\n31. (This is his final screen performance.) The movie has a suitably unsettling look, somewhere between a TV-14 cable police drama and a poverty row film noir. Waller and cinematographer Martin Alghren embrace darkness, favoring silhouettes and half-shadowed faces when they're justified, and sometimes when they aren't. A few scenes play much longer than you expected, generating an odd tension. You wonder: Are we still here because the filmmakers don't know when to quit, or because they're lulling us into complacency to set up a sucker punch? But none of these virtues \u00a0compensate for the film's shallow, derivative script and direction. \r\nWhen a goon in the spin-the-pistol scene asks McCanick \"what are you \r\nPopeye f------g Doyle?\" it seems meant as a self-aware preemptive \r\nstrike against criticism, but it's merely descriptive. \"McCanick\" barely\r\n has a frame it can claim as its own. It shambles\u00a0in the shadows of similar but richer films, and never hits its own stride.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cRumble,\u201d the guitar instrumental recorded by Link Wray in 1957, is to modern rock music what the monolith was to those primates in the \u201cDawn of Man\u201d section of \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d If you\u2019re ever on a quest for The Thing Itself in amplified music, \u201cRumble\u201d is a convincer. Sure, Chuck Berry invented licks and riffs and a worldview that invented \u201crock n roll,\u201d but Wray, with a surly distorted tone that one-upped the broken-amplifier crackle of Ike Turner\u2019s axe on \u201cRocket 88,\u201d helped invent \u201crock.\u201d Hendrix, hard rock, heavy metal all owe him big.  Advertisement He\u2019s the launching pad for this movie about Native Americans (here called \u201cIndians\u201d for reasons that become clearer as the movie goes on) and their influence not just on rock but on American music. As is pointed out more than once, the music of the Shawnee, the Choctaw, the Mohawk, the Apache, and so many other tribes, is in a very real sense the first American music. Race-mixing between blacks and Indians resulted in a cultural consciousness that enabled a melding of African music and Indian. Among other things, the movie makes a convincing case that the Indian tradition was one explicitly drawn upon by Charlie Patton, one of the giants of Delta Blues. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. The movie, directed by Catherine Bainbridge with Alfonso Maiorana, begins with Wray. And the section devoted to him is actually the weakest one in the movie. As if wanting to convince the viewer as to its authoritativeness, it mixes scintillating archival footage of the badass guitarist, from clean-cut-with-pomaded-hair \u201850s incarnation to leather-clad \u201870s Gibson SG mangler with a parade of talking heads talking about how significant \u201cRumble\u201d was. I enjoy hearing from Steven Van Zandt, the MC5\u2019s Wayne Kramer, Slash, music critic David Fricke et. al. as much as the next enthusiast, but after a while I\u2019m thinking, \u201cInstead of talking so much about \u2018Rumble,\u2019 how about letting us actually HEAR more of it?\u201d  It\u2019s also peculiar that the movie drops Wray pretty much right after giving us the news that \u201cRumble\u201d was banned from a host of radio stations, a signal accomplishment for an instrumental. \u201cThe theme song of juvenile delinquency,\u201d Van Zandt says, delightedly. Wray\u2019s subsequent career was as action-packed and eccentric as any rock figure you can name, and it doesn\u2019t get played out here. Maybe they\u2019re saving it for a separate documentary.  But the stories the film tells after Wray\u2019s are mostly well-done and frequently moving mini-movies. A section in New Orleans, featuring local hero Monk Boudreaux and several members of the Neville Brothers, is a superb pr\u00e9cis of the roots of that region\u2019s infectious music. Buffy Sainte Marie speaks of becoming a musician by happenstance, and suffering under a blacklist she wasn\u2019t even explicitly aware of for almost twenty years. Robbie Robertson recount his procession from journeyman teen guitarist to Bob Dylan\u2019s wingman during his controversial switch from folk to rock. \u201cBe proud you\u2019re an Indian but be careful who you tell,\u201d he recalls his people advising him. The movie also examines the Indian roots in the work of Mildred Bailey, a pioneer for female jazz singers and a profound influence on some male superstars who came after her, one of whom, Tony Bennett, appears in an interview.  Advertisement And there are heartbreaking stories, especially the one of Jessie Ed Davis, the spectacular guitar player who worked with blues singer Taj Mahal in the \u201960s. Allman Brothers Band member Butch Trucks recently told an interviewer that one reason the band long declined to put a studio recording of its rendition of \u201cStatesboro Blues\u201d on an album was they felt it was just a second-string copy of what Taj and Davis had done on their first album. Davis\u2019 adoption by British rockers led to a high life that unfortunately plunged Davis into junkiedom. Cleaned up, Davis teamed with Native American activist and poet John Trudell for the great \u201cAKA Grafitti Man\u201d project. In the film, Trudell (who was interviewed prior to his own 2015 passing) says of Davis, \u201cHe set me on my way, and then he checked out.\u201d  The movie goes down byways you might not have expected: Taboo from Black Eyed Peas makes an appearance, and heavy metal shows up via both guitarist Steve Salas (one of the movie\u2019s executive producers) and drummer Randy Castillo, who played with Ozzy. Their stories are among the movie\u2019s most moving. Appropriately, \u201cRumble\u201d ends at Standing Rock, North Dakota, with the sight of indigenous people protesting the Keystone pipeline, confronted by faceless authority figures who look ready to beat them down. The struggle continues. \u201cWe\u2019re right and the world is wrong,\u201d as Robertson said he came to believe in the period when he and Bob Dylan were practically getting booed off the stage every night.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Armor of Light", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cThe Armor of Light\u201d begins with footage from a 1992 anti-abortion rally, in which one of the protest\u2019s leaders, a minister, is seen cradling a preserved human fetus in his hands. This gentleman, the Reverend Robert Schenck, happens to be the protagonist of the documentary.\u00a0 \n I\u2019ll put my cards on the table, for what it\u2019s worth. I\u2019m what some would call \u201cpro-choice\u201d and I am neither moved nor engaged by tactics such as the one used by Reverend Schenck. Regardless, one supposes that the footage does establish what some would call Schenck\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d credentials, and once the movie has done so, Schenck narrates an event that would change his life: the 1998 murder, or assassination if you please, of Dr. Bernard Slepian, an abortion provider who was killed by an anti-abortion activist. \u201cI was more than shocked, I was stunned,\u201d Schenck says, going on to say that he just couldn\u2019t believe that anyone \u201cpro-life\u201d would actually take a life. \u201cI was na\u00efve,\u201d he concludes. Gee, you think? Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it seems relatively clear that the rhetoric used by those from Schenck\u2019s camp is frequently on the heated-to-the-point-of-inflammatory side. There\u2019s not much hate-the-sin-love-the-sinner going on in this debate.\u00a0 Advertisement \n In any event, Schenck was genuinely moved, because he took a hard, detailed look at the gun culture within the wide-ranging evangelical community in the United States, and decided to \u2026 well, to question it. Schenck, as this documentary from co-directors Abigail Disney and Kathleen Hughes demonstrates, is not exactly an anti-gun crusader. Rather, he seeks to imbue a spirit of mindfulness to his flock. To just think about the potential contradictions within deeming oneself both \u201cpro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-gun.\u201d For merely suggesting such a thing, he gets a lot of pushback.\u00a0 \n Intersecting Schenck\u2019s story is that of Lucia McBeth, a flight attendant whose son was shot to death by Michael Dunn after a service-station conflict over music coming from the vehicle in which victim Jordan Davis sat. Davis was African-American, Dunn white. Dunn invoked Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws, which had recently served George Zimmerman so well, to justify his actions.\u00a0 \n So yes: this movie pokes its camera eye into about a dozen distinct forms of controversy. And yet \u201cThe Armor of Light\u201d is a calm, measured, and very visually attractive film (each and every shot that\u2019s not from archival or found footage is meticulously composed and executed; Disney & Hughes do NOT do \u201cB-roll\u201d), one that holds conclusions at arm\u2019s length.\u00a0 \n While drawing compelling portraits of Schenck, McBeth, and McBeth\u2019s family lawyer John Phillips, the movie also provides some peculiar glimpses into the aforementioned gun culture. Archival footage shows NRA head Wayne LaPierre proclaiming, \u201cThe only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.\u201d Later in the film, at a quiet meeting with fellow evangelicals (which opens with a prayer, even), an Operation Rescue member earnestly parrots those exact words to Schenck. It\u2019s like something out of \u201cThey Live,\u201d or Orwell. The same fellow also utters the catchphrase \u201cAn armed society is a polite society,\u201d and goes on to explain that two people who meet on the street who both know that the other is armed are not going to shoot each other, which begs the question of why they were going to shoot each other in the first place. In other scenes, several church-going folk discuss a fantasy scenario in which a child molester is luring a kid into a van but is stopped by a gun-toting parishioner. When has this ever happened, really? There\u2019s a tendency among some folks to try and bolster LaPierre\u2019s position by sending skeptics a blog post from Controversial Times, or some other highly reliable website, about the dozen or so times that a good guy with a gun HAS stopped a bad guy with a gun. I don\u2019t know what the actuarial tables make of this, given that the number of times this hasn\u2019t happened is well over a dozen but \u2026 oh, good grief.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Disney and Hughes' film, for all its evenhandedness of tone, is clearly in Schenck and particularly McBath\u2019s corner; it regards the conviction of Dunn as a triumph for common sense and justice. For all that, the film\u2019s calmness, and its roundabout approach to narrative\u2014somewhat unavoidable given the structure Disney & Hughes choose, which is to tell a lot of the story more or less as it happens rather than in retrospect\u2014diffuse some of its power. The overwhelming and slightly dispiriting (for this viewer, at least) note that \u201cThe Armor Of Light\u201d ends on is that the road ahead for Schenck is a long one, and the folks he wants to persuade along that road are not easily swayed from their reflexive disdain of a \u201cnanny state.\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "After the Storm", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Hirokazu Kore-eda has drawn comparisons to Yasujiro Ozu in the way he\u2019s not as interested in major plot twists or set pieces as he is subtle human emotion, typically hinging on family dynamics. In films like \u201cNobody Knows,\u201d \u201cAfter Life\u201d and \u201cStill Walking\u201d (the three best of an incredible career if you\u2019re looking for a place to start), he turns the camera into a window. We look through it and see people a lot like us on the other side, but that empathy never comes through manipulation or clich\u00e9. With his latest, the remarkably moving \u201cAfter the Storm,\u201d he again finds truth and drama in relatable human behavior, and does so by sketching fully-realized, three-dimensional characters. \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d is about a man unable to live in the present. He is always longing for what he\u2019s lost or dreaming about what he has yet to achieve. And it\u2019s destroying him. We\u2019ve all been there. We\u2019ve all waded in regret and felt skeptical about the future. \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d is one of our best filmmaker\u2019s best films. Advertisement Ryota (Hiroshi Abe) has understandable reasons for his depression. He\u2019s a prize-winning author, but he has yet to follow up on the success of his novel, The Empty Table. He has a job working as a private detective, but it doesn\u2019t seem to bring him much joy\u2014and it\u2019s a profession that plays into Kore-eda\u2019s themes as Ryota is always looking at other people\u2019s lives instead of his own. He\u2019s taken to bringing along his P.I. colleague on surveillance of his ex-wife Kyoko (Yoko Maki), who has a new beau. Even though Ryota has never met the new man in Kyoko\u2019s life, he feels challenged by him, especially when it comes to the attention of his son Shingo (Taiyo Yoshizawa). One night, during a typhoon, Ryota finds himself stuck in his mother\u2019s (the amazing Kirin Kiki) apartment with Shingo and Kyoko. There are no grand revelations or emotional breakdowns, just a series of heartfelt conversations, but the sunlight looks a bit different the next day. \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d is as delicately balanced as any film Kore-eda has made, a film that seems to not have much action or momentum but finds cumulative emotional power. Ryota worries about his mother now that his father has passed; he spies on his ex and son; he gambles more than he should\u2014he lives in the past, always talking about his now-broken family, his father, his childhood. And he has a certain victimhood to his tone when he does so, as if life dealt him a bad hand and it\u2019s not his fault. There\u2019s an almost throwaway moment\u2014although Kore-eda\u2019s films are so finely balanced they contain no such thing\u2014in which Ryota and his partner tell a client about a cheating husband, and she doesn\u2019t respond as emotionally as they expect, saying \u201cFor better or worse, it\u2019s all part of my life.\u201d It's that comfort with life's speedbumps and the fact that they shape us as much as anything. Ryota is the kind of guy who gives money to his mother and then asks to borrow some from his sister. He so desperately wants to impress those about whom he cares deeply, and he confuses material goods and cash flow with actual communication and attention. Notice how he doesn\u2019t eat when he takes his son out for a meal\u2014he can\u2019t afford it\u2014and he totally wastes the chance to get to know him by grilling the boy about the new man in his mother\u2019s life. Perfectly directed by Kore-eda, Hiroshi Abe gives one of the best performances in any of his films. He has the perfect hangdog face: unable to make eye contact easily, uncombed hair and unshaven.

{"Title": "Battle of the Sexes", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Going into \u201cBattle of the Sexes,\u201d one might expect an equally-balanced look at the lives of self-proclaimed chauvinist Bobby Riggs and tennis superstar Billie Jean King. This is not that movie. And it shouldn\u2019t be really. The best angle of the film is the way it illuminates the difference between fighting for equality and battling to hold on to perceived superiority. Of course, this is a fight that continues to this day, and not just in terms of gender. If anything, there\u2019s a better version of \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d that focuses even more fully on King, villainizing Riggs and his grotesque culture of sexism in a way this movie disappointingly seems scared to do. The material involving King\u2019s fight for equality is powerful, and the performances are uniformly strong, but there\u2019s a TV movie approach to the emotion and truth of this situation that softens it in detrimental ways. It\u2019s not a \u201cbad\u201d film, but Billie Jean King\u2019s story could have been so much deeper. It\u2019s a movie that doesn\u2019t hit nearly as hard as she did. Advertisement King is played by the Oscar-winning Emma Stone, who captures her unique blend of determined grit and awkward social behavior. Her take on King is relatively shy and spotlight-averse, the opposite of the gregarious Bobby Riggs, portrayed by Steve Carell. A gambling addict, the 55-year-old Riggs has lost his drive, looking for the next hustle to keep him happy, even as his bad habits frustrate his wife, played in a totally thankless role by Elizabeth Shue. When the head of the Tennis Association, played with an almost caricature degree of smarm by Bill Pullman, offers a tournament in which the female winner will get $1,500 while the male winner gets $12,000, King jumps ship, and she takes almost every female tennis player that matters with her. Led by Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman), the ladies form their own tennis tour, and the world notices, including Bobby Riggs. While Riggs is looking for his next big thing, King is confronted with something she didn\u2019t expect, a romance with her hairdresser, Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough). Happily married to Larry (Austin Stowell), Billie Jean never expected to fall in love with another woman, and it\u2019s the kind of affair that could destroy her career, especially as the new tour is trying to find sponsors. With this new romance as the backdrop, King ends up agreeing to a one-time match with Riggs, who believes that an over-the-hill male tennis player can still beat the #1 young, female tennis champion. While a lot of the people around her see this as just a gimmick, she realizes the message it could send to the world if she loses.  With copious amounts of \u201870s style and music, directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (\u201cLittle Miss Sunshine\u201d) work hard to recreate a period in which male chauvinism could still be very easily taken as a public position. It\u2019s hard to imagine a dinosaur like Bobby Riggs getting any attention beyond a small core of morons nowadays. Even if his brand of sexism is depressingly alive and well, it\u2019s not the kind of thing sports announcers openly defend. Listening to Howard Cosell and company legitimize Riggs\u2019 worldview shows how much of a culture King had to work to tear down. Advertisement However, it also makes one wonder why writer Simon Beaufoy didn\u2019t take a tougher stance against Riggs. Scenes with his wife and child are clearly designed to humanize him in a way that feels oddly disingenuous. At one point, he\u2019s a goofy charmer, but then we see how much larger a hill that King had to climb because of the Riggs brand of sexism and it\u2019s hard not wish the movie didn\u2019t too often treat him as a harmless clown. There\u2019s a better version of \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d that focuses more completely on just King because this half-developed, comedy approach to Riggs\u2019 life doesn\u2019t add enough to this version. As for performances, Dayton & Faris have always been strong with an ensemble, and that\u2019s true here as well. Stone is subtle and powerful, but Riseborough actually gives my favorite performance of the film, playing someone who feels more three-dimensional than the icons at the center of the piece. Similarly, Alan Cumming does a lot with just a few scenes, which isn\u2019t that unusual for him. Less fortunate are Shue and Pullman, turned into the archetypes of the Frustrated Wife and the Sexist Boss. The final scenes of Pullman sneering as he watches the match might as well have had him twirling a curled mustache. It\u2019s that superficial approach to the world around Billie Jean King that diminishes her story. Instead of a timeless story, this feels like a Hollywood production that softens what was truly and genuinely a battle, one that women are still fighting today.

The game night covered in this movie includes Ryan (Billy Magnussen), a dimwitted friend of Annie's; Sarah (Sharon Horgan), Ryan's much smarter date; the husband-wife team of Kevin and Michelle (Lamorne Morris and Kylie Bunbury); and Max's estranged brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler), who's a success in ways that Max can only dream about.\u00a0 Advertisement Then Brooks invites the guests out to his rich-guy house for a different kind of game night, modeled on those murder mystery dinner parties that became a fad a few years ago, and \"Game Night\" becomes a roller coaster ride, whisking the audience through broad slapstick, deadpan exchanges and imminent threats that sometimes erupt into mayhem.\u00a0 Brooks gets kidnapped in a home invasion that everybody else assumes is just part of the game, and threatened with murder if the others don't deliver a precious Faberge egg to a scary-voiced mastermind who's giving them orders from afar. The rest of the team splits up into pairs and tries to solve the mystery in their own way, their paths periodically re-crossing, only to diverge again.\u00a0 If you've seen \"The Game\" or other films in which an escapist adventure turns weird and frightening, you'll anticipate some but not all of the twists and turns of \"Game Night,\" and you'll appreciate the way that the screenwriter and directors tie them to the psychology of the characters, and structure the film as a journey of personal as well as narrative discovery. The brothers'\u00a0mutual resentment and\u00a0rivalry is nearly as important here as it was in \"The Game.\" Max and Annie's inability to conceive a child comes into play as well, as do the psychologies and pasts\u00a0of other game night participants. A subplot about Kevin's obsession with figuring out whether Michelle was ever unfaithful to him has a terrific payoff that flips over on itself. There are juicy bits for supporting players as well, including Jeffrey Wright as an FBI agent, Danny Huston as a decadent rotter (his specialty), Michael C. Hall as a scary criminal known as The Bulgarian, and Jesse Plemons as the divorced and seemingly personality-free cop who lives in the same cul-de-sac as Max and Annie and seems obsessed with getting invited to game night again. None of these characters are quite as they appear on first or second\u00a0glance.\u00a0 \"Game Night\" is a nearly perfect entertainment for adults over a certain age. There's a madcap car chase, a violent incident that leads to impromptu surgery, and a house party with echoes of the masked spectacle in \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" but it's all entwined with\u00a0commentary about aging, disappointment, doomed romanticism and sibling rivalry. The\u00a0actors put it all across with flair\u2014especially Bateman and McAdams, who complete each other's thoughts so gracefully that they really do seem as if they've been married forever, and Plemons, who steals every scene he's in through deft underplaying. And while\u00a0there are a few touching moments, the film never tries to claim sentimental or revelatory power it hasn't earned. Advertisement Control of tone is essential in any film that doesn't adhere to a familiar formula, and luckily for the audience, Daley and Goldstein are on top of things. They've got a knack for figuring how far is too far, pushing right up to the border, then stopping with one toe over the line. The understated cartoonishness, anchored in Bateman and McAdams' teamwork, helps a lot. Characters keep sustaining physical injuries that would kill or incapacitate people in reality, only to bounce back and resume the game, but their mishaps are calibrated so that they just seem to smack a bit of sense into them, like an exploding cigar or an anvil on the head in a Bugs Bunny short. This is one of the best surprises of a still-young movie year: a comedy that takes nothing seriously except fun.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cWhat\u2019s the highest grossing Swedish movie of all time?\u201d you\r\nask. Wait, no, you didn\u2019t ask? Well, too bad. The highest grossing Swedish\r\nmovie of all time, apparently, is this one, new to U.S. release, and watching\r\nit, one can see why. The Swedish film industry is one of the oldest and most\r\nadvanced in the world\u2014during the teens and \u201820s of the 20th century,\r\nits output was absolutely on a par with what the greatest innovators of the\r\nU.S. and France were up to\u2014but it is often associated with a kind of dourness,\r\non account (somewhat unfairly) of Ingmar Bergman and his death-occupied allegories.\r\nEven Sweden\u2019s popular culture is pretty dark\u2014it\u2019s from this country that the\r\ndark thrillers of Steig Larsson hail. This movie, as it happens, is a comedy,\r\nbut it\u2019s a frequently grisly one, and one that makes rollicking fun of a lot of\r\ndark Swedish preoccupations.  Advertisement Its plot is very neatly summed up by its title, which was\r\nalso the title of the bestselling novel upon which it is based. The movie\r\nbegins with a dynamite fuse crackling through the opening credits; then, its\r\naged hero, Allan, puts his cat Molotov outside for a bit, and the poor kitty is\r\nkilled by a coyote. Allan takes his revenge by blowing up the offending\r\ncreature. This action lands him in a nursing home, out of whose window he\r\nclimbs on his 100th birthday. The nursing home staff never finds him\r\n(that\u2019s not really a spoiler), but we follow him on his subsequent adventure,\r\nwhich is intercut with his narration and flashbacks of his picaresque 100-year\r\nlife.  \u201cAll I ever want to do is eat, sleep, and blow things up,\u201d\r\nAllan avers at one point. A cruelty inflicted on him in childhood precludes (or\r\nat least inhibits) romance, leaving him with those three easy-to-fulfill\r\ndesires. The blowing-things-up part is part of what gave this story particular\r\nappeal to Swedes. Sweden was, of course, the home of Alfred Nobel, the inventor\r\nof dynamite whose subsequent guilt about it led to the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nSweden\u2019s national character, apparently, is at least partially defined by the\r\nparadox that this peace-loving, ostensibly \u201cprogressive\u201d country is most\r\nnotable in 20th-century world-historical terms for advancing the\r\nscience of explosives. And so we see Allan cavorting through the century,\r\nblissfully free of ideology or perspective\u2014a more well-spoken, self-aware Forrest Gump, if you please\u2014encountering the likes of Franco and Oppenheimer\r\nand Stalin, and just happy to make things go boom the whole while. In the\r\npresent day, he stumbles upon a suitcase full of cash, makes an accomplice of a\r\nrascally railway station agent, helps rescue a circus elephant, and more, all\r\nwhile thoroughly flummoxing a motorcycle gang who want the cash and the\r\nextremely understaffed and indolent police force that\u2019s pursuing him. That last\r\nelement is a bit of a subtle counter to the depiction of Swedish cops in the\r\naforementioned Steig Larsson books.  Still you don\u2019t have to be Swedish to enjoy the film. The\r\npicaresque mode is one that\u2019s well-liked throughout Western culture, and this\r\nmovie, directed by Felix Herngren and starring popular Swedish comedian Robert\r\nGustaffson, executes it reasonably well, with touches not just reminiscent of\r\n\u201cGump\u201d but of \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d and other popular tall tales of our\r\ntime. It is ever so slightly more cynical and in-your-face with mordant humor\r\nthan a mainstream American film would have been; the insouciant treatment of\r\nAllan\u2019s first experiment with dynamite is more Adam Rifkin than Robert\r\nZemeckis. Such slight tonal eccentricities didn\u2019t quite do the trick for this\r\nreviewer, however.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Borgman", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In the same black, poisoned vein as \"Dogtooth\" and \"Funny Games\" pumps Alex van Warmerdam\u2019s \"Borgman,\" another darkly comic thriller about domesticity crumbling into violence and even insanity. Like a religious parable designed to present more questions than answers, \"Borgman\" can sometimes frustrate but it is an accomplished piece of work, driven by a uniquely malevolent tonal balance and two fantastic central performances. It sometimes simmers when I wish it would boil over but damn if it isn\u2019t fascinating to watch the water bubble. Advertisement \"And they descended upon the Earth to strengthen their ranks.\" After that unsettling biblical quote, van Warmerdam opens with a series of equally unsettling images as an old-fashioned hunting party heads into a wooded area with spears, a barking dog and a shotgun. I should mention that the gentleman carrying the firearm is a priest. They\u2019re clearly after something evil and that something lives underground. Having crafted himself a home under the Earth (or perhaps born there as some sort of demon), lives Camiel Borgman (the fantastic Jan Bijvoet). He escapes the hunting party and alerts two fellow earth dwellers\u2014Richard (Jeroen Perceval) and Ludwig (the director himself)\u2014that they must move on as well. Is Borgman just a homeless man? Why were people trying to kill him? Why does he live underground? What is he planning next? What ranks? Did he \"descend upon the Earth\"? \"Borgman\" is one of those films in which questions pile up much more quickly than resolutions, which leads to a growing sense of unease that only strengthens as Borgman and his mates enter suburbia and bodies begin to pile up. Borgman knocks on the door of Richard (Jeroen Perceval) and Marina (Hadewych Minis), the heads of a seemingly normal family, complete with children and a regular nanny (Sara Hjort Ditlevsen). All Borgman asks for is a bath. Can a well-spoken, seemingly harmless homeless man get clean? When Richard balks, Borgman claims to know Marina. She denies it but the first crack is already in place in this relationship before he\u2019s even in the house. Richard confronts the tramp on his front step, beating him brutally. When Marina later finds Borgman hiding in the garage, she takes pity on him, in no small part because he\u2019s been injured by her husband. She lets him stay in hiding in the house. And Borgman knows how to hide, often having to say \"I\u2019m here\" because no one actually hears him come in. He borders on supernatural in the way he smoothly slides in and out of the family home, and he begins to influence Richard, Marina, and their children. \"Influence\" is one word for it. Where \"Borgman\" goes from here, I won\u2019t spoil, but it takes a turn from what you might presume is a simple domestic thriller to something much stranger when Borgman\u2019s crew gets heavily involved in what one could only describe as the takeover of an upper-class family. Van Warmerdam is clearly commenting on class issues, countering Borgman\u2019s tramp status with the wealth on display in the world that he increasingly manipulates. However, the social commentary of \"Borgman\" feels like background more than thematic centerpiece. Van Warmerdam is way more interested in mood, malevolence, and the general sense of unease that permeates every frame of \"Borgman.\" To start asking too many questions about Borgman\u2019s background and purpose is to lose focus on the more tonal joys to be held here. There is malice, darkness, and true evil potentially hiding not just within every knock at the door but at the family dinner table. It only takes a catalyst to reveal it. At almost two hours, some of \"Borgman\" feels a bit too cinematically deliberate\u2014purposefully opaque without meaning at all, even tonally. There were times when I wanted to \"get on with it\" and I'm not sure the destination satisfies as much as the journey. However, frustrations are few and far between, thanks in large part to the riveting work by Bijvoet and Minis as the drifter and the woman he claimed to know when all he needed was a place to take a bath. Or did he? Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Silence", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Silence\" is a monumental work, and a punishing one. It puts you through hell with no promise of enlightenment, only a set of questions and propositions, sensations and experiences. It is no surprise to learn that the film's director, Martin Scorsese, has been working on it for decades, since he first read the 1966\u00a0source novel\u00a0by Sh\u00fbsaku End\u00f4 about Jesuit priests suffering for their faith in 17th century Japan, where Christianity is outlawed. I can't think of another Scorsese film that's so intent on simply showing us things and letting us consider their meaning. There's a little bit of voiceover narration and a few shots that go inside characters' perceptions, but for the most part you're an observer, watching people from a purposeful distance. The film starts with a long moment of actual silence, and embraces silence throughout its running time, or something akin to silence. Wood burning, waves crashing, wind moving through grass: this is what you often hear in place of a musical score. When \"Silence\" is not quiet, you wish that it were, because the soundtrack is filled with moans of pain and screams of agony and the sounds of bones being broken and flame searing flesh. And, of course, during such moments you fear silence, too, because the grave is silent. Advertisement The story is simple: two priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) leave Portugal for Japan to find a third priest (Liam Neeson) who has gone missing while working as a missionary. The third priest is believed to have committed apostasy by stepping on an image of Jesus Christ after being tormented by the Japanese. Eventually, one of these wandering priests\u2014Garfield's character,\u00a0Father Sebasti\u00e3o Rodrigues\u2014gets captured and goes through a similar experience, surviving torture and witnessing the torture of others while pondering unanswerable questions: How much suffering can a man take before breaking and renouncing that which is most important to him? If he does break, does it mean he has failed God? Does God want him to resist blasphemy no matter what the cost? Or does he want the priest to give up and renounce his faith, secure in the knowledge that God's love is great enough to forgive him for not being able to endure unendurable pain? Is God indifferent to the suffering? Does He even notice it? The movie starts with the first priest,\u00a0Father Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Ferreira (Neeson), witnessing mass torture of Christians and being told that if he will only commit apostasy, the suffering will cease. The story then jumps forward many years to find Father Rodrigues and his partner,\u00a0Father Francisco Garrpe (Adam Driver), as they make their way to Japan by way of Macao (with help from a Japanese Christian whose own faith seems reawakened by serving as their guide). The first hour of the film is a somewhat picaresque narrative that slowly builds dread as the priests get closer to figuring out what happened their predecessor. The Japanese authorities don't take kindly to Europeans wandering around their island nation talking about the glories of Jesus. In fact, they see Christianity as a cancer to be cut from the body politic. In the film's second half, Father Rodrigues finds himself locked in a wooden cage and forced to watch and hear the torture of Japanese Christians\u2014some of whom followed and helped him. He is plagued by doubts, not just about the wisdom of coming to Japan or his capacity to survive this ordeal, but the wisdom of the missionary enterprise, which expects people to suffer and die on behalf of ideals. The priest even begins to wonder what God wants, what He's thinking, and whether He has a point-of-view on misery and pain. Advertisement What would Jesus do? A lot of people in Father Rodrigues' position would interpret that as a physical challenge:\u00a0if Christ withstood the agonies of the cross, I can get through this.\u00a0But Christ wasn't mortal, so it's an unfair test. But what if the unfairness of the test is the test? And what of the other prisoners in the facility with the priest? All it would take to end their suffering\u2014or so the priest is told\u2014is one footprint on the image of the savior. Is it moral to allow others to suffer when their suffering can be ended with a single symbolic gesture? Would God want that? Maybe the priest is destined to realize that it\u2019s all right to apostatize if it ends the pain of others.\u00a0 Scorsese and his co-screenwriter Jay Cocks\u2014the two did uncredited rewrites on \"The Last Temptation of Christ\"\u2014have been accused by some of my colleagues of glorifying the European missionaries, or at least not examining them in a critical enough way. I didn\u2019t get this out of \u201cSilence\u201d at all. In fact, one of the things that impressed me most about it was the care it devotes to understanding the position of the Japanese authorities. Without condoning their brutality, it lets a major character\u2014Inoue Masashige (Issei Ogata), one of the officials in charge of eradicating Christianity from Japan, and the supervisor of the hero\u2019s suffering\u2014explain the official point-of-view on Western religion. He doesn\u2019t just consider it a corrupting influence on Japanese culture, he doubts that Christianity can truly take root in the \u201cswamp\u201d (his word) of his home country. There are echoes here of another recurring Scorsese fascination, the self-preservation instinct of the tribe. The tribe may tolerate rebellion, heresy or external threats up to a point, but after that they crack down mercilessly.\u00a0 Scorsese's respectful distance makes the suffering more unbearable than it would be if he showed every atrocity in close-up. It's unsettling because it conflates the point-of-view of God and the point-of-view of the audience. You're paralyzed. You want to act, or you want the movie to act, to stop the suffering, but the suffering continues until finally it doesn't. We're watching men of God being tested. Try as they might, they cannot entirely wrap their minds around the purpose of the test, and when they do grapple with it, they worry that they've arrived at the wrong conclusion. They worry that they\u2019ve missed the point; that they're not faithful enough or smart enough to understand why this horror exists, or must exist.\u00a0I don\u2019t know what to think of the ending of the film, which I won\u2019t discuss here except to say that I\u2019ve changed my mind about it many times, and that it seems to be constructed to encourage viewers to come at it again from new angles rather than settling on a single conclusion.\u00a0This is not the sort of film you \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdon't like.\u201d It's a film that you experience and then live with.\u00a0 Advertisement Scorsese has been here before, in one sense or another\u2014not just in straightforwardly theological dramas such as \"Kundun\" and \"The Last Temptation of Christ,\" but in his crime pictures and thrillers as well. The entire running time of \"Silence\" could be the self-flagellating fantasy of the young hoodlum hero of Scorsese's 1973 breakthrough \"Mean Streets\" as he holds his hand over a flame (the title character in \"Taxi Driver\" did the same thing), and the terrors visited upon the priests and their flock are sadistic enough to have come straight from the reptile brain of Max Cady in \"Cape Fear,\" a devil or demon figure who exists to punish people for the sins of weakness, hypocrisy and pride. But \"Silence\" foregrounds such things in the manner of a parable that is not intended to lead the listener to a single realization but to stimulate thought and emotion. This, too, is characteristic of Scorsese, who studied to be a priest but became a monk for cinema, and who nonchalantly describes himself as a \"lapsed Catholic\" yet has been preoccupied with sin and salvation for nearly 50 years and weaves Christian themes, imagery and situations throughout his work. You even find them in what might otherwise be straightforward commercial genre projects\u2014\"Cape Fear,\" \"The Departed\" and \"The Color of Money\" spring to mind\u2014in which Scorsese seems to be using theology to frame his story and characters in ways that he understands, maybe as a way of personalizing a story that's not all that personal otherwise. For a lapsed Catholic he sure does see the entire world in terms of imponderables and spiritual tests. Maybe there\u2019s an alternate reality in which Scorsese became a priest. I bet he was a good one.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "For \u201cThe Kingdom of Dreams and Madness,\u201d director Mami\r\nSunada was allowed remarkable access to one of the most important artistic\r\nenterprises of the last half-century, Studio Ghibli, at a unique point in\r\nits existence. News about the shuttering of the company that has given the\r\nworld masterpieces like \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d and \u201cSpirited Away\u201d reverberated\r\nthroughout the animation community and beyond earlier this year. And there\u2019s a\r\nsense in \u201cKingdom\" that this is an elegy of sorts, a goodbye to an era of\r\nremarkable creative resonance. The cinematic visions that emerged from the\r\ndrawing tables of this relatively nondescript building have influenced\r\ncountless creative voices, and will continue to do so for the rest of time. To\r\nsay I\u2019m a Ghibli fan would be something of an understatement (my \u201cTotoro\u201d\r\niPhone case had to be internationally ordered, for the record), and so \u201cKingdom\u201d\r\nnaturally speaks to my interests. If you\u2019re not enraptured with the work of\r\nHayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and the rest of the artists at Ghibli, it may not\r\nbe precisely what you\u2019re looking for, but Sanada captures something poetic\r\nabout art and creativity that could speak to anyone, animation fan or\r\notherwise. Advertisement Having said that, it\u2019s very helpful to have seen \u201cThe Wind\r\nRises\u201d and \u201cThe Tale of the Princess Kaguya,\u201d the two most recent Ghibli films,\r\nand the two pieces being worked on for the year Sanada had access to the\r\nstudio. Just the very idea that two such massive productions from two masters\r\nof the form were being produced simultaneously seems to cause ulcers in several\r\nproducers involved. And yet Miyazaki\u2019s process has been the same for decades.\r\nHe works from 11am-9pm every day, on the dot. He doesn\u2019t write scripts, he\r\nwrites storyboards, and his assistants begin production from those drawings\r\nbefore he\u2019s done, unsure of how the film will end. Miyazaki is very open with\r\nhis process, opening his studio and home to Sanada, and philosophizing on art\r\nand humanity in ways that feel like someone coming to terms with a life\u2019s work.\r\nHe speaks candidly about how he makes films for others, most notably the people\r\nat Ghibli, and yet there\u2019s something so deeply personal about \u201cThe Wind Rises\u201d\r\nthat it\u2019s the first film that makes him cry after its premiere screening. He\r\nshares the \u201cbeautiful but cursed dreams\u201d of its protagonist. \u201cThe Kingdom of Dreams and Madness\u201d contains surprisingly\r\nlittle actual film footage. There are more shots of Miyazaki's cat than his films. We see bits and pieces of \u201cWind Rises\u201d as it\u2019s\r\nbeing assembled, but this is more a \u201cyear in the life\u201d documentary than a\r\nhistory of the studio, although there are bits and pieces of the latter. Sanada\u2019s\r\nfilm is at its best when the director conveys the realization that this is a\r\nstudio and creative voice at the very least in a transitional period and\r\narguably in its twilight phase. The music, the tone, the subject matter of the\r\ntwo films, Miyazaki\u2019s candid self-reflection\u2014it all combines to paint a\r\nportrait of something beautiful that\u2019s coming to an end. At nearly two hours,\r\nSanada hits a few of these beats a bit too many times, even for this fan, and\r\nthe film bizarrely feels like it\u2019s ending around the 90-minute mark, complete\r\nwith a production-finishing montage, only to go on for another half-hour. It\u2019s\r\na fascinating look into a creative process that has been essential to the\r\nhistory of animation, but it could have been tighter as a documentary. There\u2019s an amazing passage in which Miyazaki receives a letter\r\nfrom a man who received assistance from Miyazaki\u2019s father after the war. The\r\nproduction of \u201cThe Wind Rises\u201d inspired the man to write Miyazaki, and the\r\ndirector points out how the event \u201cProbably shaped the way this man looked at\r\nthe world.\u201d Reality influenced art which then reflected back on reality. The\r\ntruth is that Miyazaki and the people at Studio Ghibli have been shaping the\r\nway we look at the world for years, and will continue to do so long after the\r\nKingdom has closed.

{"Title": "Much Ado About Nothing", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Within the first 10 minutes of Joss Whedon's \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" I found myself smiling with excitement, while also holding my breath in nervous anxiety. Would the film be able to sustain its confident manic tone, maintain its humor and smarts, its depth of characterization and innovative use of text and landscape? Would the magic hold? The magic holds. It holds from beginning to end. Audiences will remember Kenneth Branagh's well-received version from 1993, with the cast of stars tumbling and laughing over bright hillsides in Tuscany, dressed in flowing period garb. Whedon takes a different approach. It's done in modern dress. There are no big stars in it, although fans of Whedon's films and television series will recognize many of his regulars. He shot in glamorous black-and-white (Jay Hunter was the cinematographer), which may seem like a serious choice for such comedic material until you remember that some of the funniest comedies ever made were filmed in black-and-white. Whedon firmly places \"Much Ado About Nothing\" in the screwball tradition where it belongs. He uses one main location (his own house), and much of it takes place in echoing high-end interiors, perfect for a story where everyone is constantly eavesdropping on everyone else. The acoustics in the house are very poor for anyone who wants to keep a secret. The adaptation, done by Whedon, is terrific. The play moves from comedy to tragedy and back with dizzying speed, and while you may feel like you're getting whiplash, that's the desired effect. Advertisement Whedon, beloved by television audiences for his cult favorites \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Firefly\" (to mention just a few), is known for creating independent and memorable female characters, and in this, Shakespeare is a perfect fit for him as a director. Shakespeare created Rosalind in \"As You Like It,\" Katherine in \"Taming of the Shrew,\" Lady Macbeth in \"Macbeth,\" Cleopatra in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and a host of iconic others.  Misogyny is alive and well in Shakespeare and takes on a particularly vicious aspect in \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" when a woman's virginity is prized above her humanity, but Shakespeare, as usual, has his cake and eats it too. \"Much Ado\" strolls into some pretty dark forests, morally and spiritually, and while I'm not sure that Hero, the betrayed heroine, would agree with the title that it all had been \"much ado about nothing,\" the crookedness of the universe is righted gloriously in the end. The intrigues of Italian war and political life are merely backdrop in Shakespeare's comedy and it's backdrop here, too. The opening shows Don Pedro and Claudio (Reed Diamond and Fran Kranz, both excellent) returning from abroad, complete with security detail and a motorcade of gleaming cars. They bring with them Benedick (the marvelous Alexis Denisof), Don John (Sean Maher, who looks like Robert Chambers, the Preppy Murderer, a perfect choice considering Don John's malevolent character), and Don John's cunning sidekick Conrade (played, in Whedon's version, by a woman, Riki Lindhome). They stop off at the beautiful home of Leonato (Clark Gregg), to celebrate with relatives and friends, all of whom have nothing else to do besides hang out in the house, drink wine, gossip, and make mischief with one another's love lives. Claudio confesses to Don Pedro that he has fallen in instant-love with Leonato's beautiful young daughter Hero (Jillian Morgese). Don Pedro immediately begins scheming on a way to bring the romance to fruition. A masked ball thrown that night gives him the opportunity he is looking for. Hero's cousin Beatrice (played by Amy Acker) tells anyone who will listen (and even those who tune her out) that love is not for her, and marriage is for the birds. She especially wants everyone to know that Benedick is a jerk, and he doesn't matter to her at all! Benedick returns her insults, to her face and behind her back. Of course if the two were as indifferent towards one another as they declared, then why do they keep talking incessantly about each other? Hero and her maids, along with the menfolk in the house, conspire to bring the arguing two together. Advertisement All of this love-making could have gone forward without a hitch if Don John had not been in the house. Don John is disturbed by other people's happiness. He is the evil version of the melancholy Jaques in \"As You Like It\". He has no purpose beyond making trouble for others. He figures out a way to make it seem as if Hero had been unfaithful to Claudio, on the night before the two were to be wed. Claudio reacts ferociously. Hero faints. Leonato screams that his daughter has besmirched his family name. Don John smiles happily. Beatrice and Benedick find themselves unlikely allies in untangling the web of intrigue and malice. Doug Moston, acting teacher and Shakespeare scholar, had this to say to his classes about Shakespeare's language: \"If you think a line is bawdy, it\u2019s bawdy. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s bawdy \u2014 it\u2019s only because you haven\u2019t worked it out yet.\" Joss Whedon and his capable cast have \"worked it out.\" Every line shimmers with double entendre. Sex roils underneath every moment, every motivation, every misunderstanding and every rejoinder. Even the scene between Don John and Conrade, where Don John discusses how disturbed he is by joy, becomes a scene of hot foreplay between the two, where lines like, \"If I had my mouth I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking\" take on new worlds of meaning. Dogberry, a policeman in charge of security at Leonato's house, enters the scene late in the game, having stumbled across the plot against Hero, and once he arrives you never want him to leave. Dogberry tries to sound smart and official, all while saying things like, \"You shall comprehend all vagrom men,\" when he clearly means \"apprehend\" and \"vagrant,\" or dispatching his security guards with the order, \"Be vigitant, I beseech you.\" He is ridiculous, saying these mispronounced words with total confidence. He covers up his incompetence and lack of vocabulary with a bluff swaggering persona, complete with dark sunglasses, and Nathan Fillion, from \"Firefly\" and \"Serenity,\" gives a great and entertaining comedic performance. Advertisement Beatrice and Benedick steal the show, though, in this version and in every version I've seen, on film or on stage. Nobody has informed the two of them that they are not the leads, that their romance is the subplot. Their barbs are sometimes vicious, and both characters show a studied indifference towards marriage and love. Beatrice and Benedick are the patron saints of 1930s screwball comedy. Sam and Diane from \"Cheers\" carried on their tradition. Any rom-com we see today is haunted by the arguing defensive love-mad ghosts of Beatrice and Benedick. The two are so equally matched, so dazzlingly verbal, so witty, so \"self-endeared\" (as Hero calls Beatrice), and totally obsessed with each other that, frankly, who else could put up with either of them? It's no surprise that when Hector Berlioz turned \"Much Ado About Nothing\" into an opera in 1862, he called it \"B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict\". Claudio and Hero are the ostensible leads of \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" but Beatrice and Benedick are the ones that everyone remembers. Watching Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof battle it out, in words and in a near wrestling match near the end of the film, is a supreme pleasure. Beatrice is a tough-talkin' dame like Carole Lombard or Katharine Hepburn, and Benedick is an independent irritable guy, reminiscent of Cary Grant or William Powell. Underneath the hostility is a coursing current of love and desire, lust and fondness, which both characters struggle mightily to hide. When they finally crack, when they finally give in, it is breath-taking and emotional. \"Much Ado About Nothing\" is one of the best films of the year.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Central Intelligence", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "There's a kitchen fight in \"Central Intelligence\" pitting a man with a butcher knife against a man with a banana. The man with the banana wins. I love scenes like this, where the movie seems to be saying, \"This is the kind of movie I am\u2014the kind where you can kill a man with a banana. Enjoy.\" And you do.  The film is a buddy action comedy in the vein of \"The In-Laws\" and \"Midnight Run,\" with a splash of 1930s movie slapstick. Kevin Hart plays Calvin Joyner, a deadpan worrywart who was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" in high school. He has a good job and a charming wife but still feels like a failure. Dwayne Johnson plays his old high school classmate, Robert Weirdicht, aka Bob Stone, a bullied fat kid who grew up to become a muscular CIA agent but still wears a fanny pack and can't stop talking about \"Sixteen Candles.\" Bob is six-foot-four and built like an action figure, which comes in handy in scenes that require him to do battle with a nunchacku-wielding assassin on a motorbike, or pirouette through a battle zone tossing tiny explosives from his fanny pack like Bugs Bunny as Br\u00fcnnhilde strewing flower petals in her wake.  Advertisement Bob says he just wants to hang out with Calvin, the only guy in high school who was ever nice to him, on the eve of their 20th high school reunion. He's secretly a renegade agent accused of killing his partner and committing treason, and he needs Calvin's accounting expertise to thwart a terrorist plot and clear his name. But his adoration of Calvin is sincere. He loves Calvin the way little kids love superheroes. Worships him. Adores him. He tells Calvin he needs his help and asks if he's out or in. Calvin says he's not in. Bob says he's in, that he was always in. Calvin wants to know why Bob asked him if he was in or out if he was always in regardless. Bob says it's because he wanted to feel the pride and excitement of hearing Calvin tell him he's in. \"I'm not in,\" Calvin says. He says this again and again, all through the movie: \"I'm not in.\" He screams it while Bob is pushing him in a mail cart through a hail of gunfire and telling him to relax, everything's gonna be fine. This is their relationship.  And the best thing about this movie is that you believe in the relationship. Hart and Johnson are a classic comedy duo in the tradition of Abbott & Costello, Bob Hope & Bing Crosby and Gene Wilder & Richard Pryor. And they certainly have the silhouettes for it: when the two stand side-by-side, their height difference is so great that they become iconic: the genie and the man who summoned him.  But the film also takes them seriously as characters with dashed hopes and unrealized aspirations, men who feel things deeply even though they might not show it. They bicker, they yell at each other, and they get drawn into circuitous conversations about subjects that have little to do with the mission.\u00a0 Hart is playing a mid-period Matthew Broderick character: an emotionally constipated Everyman who sounds like he's trying to be\r\n polite even when he's hollering about some cockamamie plan\r\n that Bob has roped him into. When a \r\nburly CIA agent hands him an iPad that was supposed to show images that \r\nwould frighten and horrify him, he stares at the iPad for just exactly \r\nthe right length of time before saying, \"That's PornHub.\"\u00a0   Bob is Calvin's id, lying to him and manipulating him to draw him into dangerous situations, but he's also his voice of conscience, urging him to act like the shining example of bravery and kindness that Bob always knew him to be. Johnson, who's become a fearless comic actor as well as a great action star, does the best work of his career as Bob. Calvin calls him \"Jason Bourne in jorts,\" but despite the fact that Bob can kill a man with anything, even a banana, and has a mysteriously chilly (and chill) quality that makes Calvin wonder if those awful stories about him are true, he's a sweetie-pie\u2014a Great Dane puppy bounding through the movie. Nobody in Hollywood has Johnson's aura of decency\u2014he should have played Superman\u2014and it's used ingeniously here, to allow us to like and even root for a man who is as innocently selfish as a child, a one-man wrecking crew demanding Calvin's full attention. \"I'll never be like Molly Ringwald,\" Bob laments. He means it. And it's tearing him up inside. Advertisement Each man embodies the other's unfulfilled fantasies of \"real\" success; Bob is the bad-ass knight in shining armor that Calvin was told he was destined to become. Bob aspires to have a relationship as stable and nurturing as the one Calvin has with his onetime high school girlfriend-turned-wife, Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). Calvin thinks he's a little man, in every sense\u2014a man of no importance\u2014but Bob Stone would not exist without him. And yet Bob is still a scared kid inside, a truth conveyed in expressionistic scenes of humiliation that replay in reflected surfaces and even behind Bob's head (like a movie that Bob has literally turned his back on because he can't bear to watch).\u00a0 Bob Stone is a magnificent comic creation, a man who exhorts his friend to be the hero of his own story because it worked for Bob, and who never stops searching the text of his world for bits of foreshadowing, for signs and symbols. But he wouldn't have the same impact if Calvin weren't there beside him, babbling in apprehension and improvising whopping lies while big men threaten to kill him. The two complete each other in an ungainly yet perfect way, like the centaurs that serve as the duo's high school mascot.  \"Central Intelligence\" is written by Ike Barinholtz, David Stassen and Rawson Marshall Thurber, and directed by Thurber, who also did \"We're the Millers\" and \"Dodgeball,\" two of the better recent examples of the smart dumb comedy. It may not be a deep and complex masterpiece that will spawn symposiums and appreciations, but it is a classic of a very particular sort. It's the kind of movie that you watch on TV when you're supposed to be doing more important things, or experiencing more important movies, even though you've already seen it ten times, because it's still funny, and because you believe in the big man and the small man that he looks up to.

{"Title": "The Young Karl Marx", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Raoul Peck is on a roll. The Haitian director raised some consciousness with last year\u2019s James-Baldwin-speaks-to-today-in-his-own-words documentary \u201cI Am Not Your Negro.\u201d And now there\u2019s this, a bold, some might say dialectical exercise. That is, an account of the title character\u2019s life and thought in the packaging of a conventional and possibly sentimental biopic. The movie begins with a text account of the industrial revolution\u2019s creation of a working class called \u201cthe proletariat\u201d in Marxist thought. Then, in 1843 German, a Marxist parable, in which poor folk are slaughtered for the crime of collecting deadwood in a forest. 25-year-old Marx writes incendiary articles for the Rhineland News, and upon arrest, agrees to follow a wealthy patron, Arnold Ruge, to Paris to work on his post-Hegelian philosophy and stuff. The action moves to Manchester, England, and a sewing-thread factory owned by Friedrich Engels, Sr. Junior, his wide-eyed son, has no use for his father\u2019s autocratic mien and mistreatment of workers, and one of the movie\u2019s most audacious scenes in staging the meeting of young Engels and his future partner Mary Burns, a working class woman with then-radical ideas, as a kind of meet-cute on the father\u2019s factory floor in the middle of a walkout.    Advertisement In Paris, Marx struggles, unpaid by Ruge, unable to provide for his wife Jenny and their daughter. Jenny is played by Vicky Krieps, of newly minted \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d fame. She is a very vivid presence from her entrance on\u2014the filmmakers could have cashed in by re-titling the U.S. release \u201cThe Hungry Karl Marx.\u201d Marx meets the visiting Engels in Ruge\u2019s drawing room, and after sniffing around each other\u2014Karl instinctively distrusts the born-into-wealth Friedrich\u2014express admiration for each other\u2019s work. They head to the streets, run from French monarchist police who are busting heads of foreigners and agitators, and get wildly drunk, on both exchanged ideas and spirits. Then it\u2019s The Hungover Karl Marx.    The movie chronicles their friendship, collaboration, and the tough time they had persuading more idealistic and less proactive workers\u2019 representatives that a coherent doctrine was necessary for any meaningful movement to form and thrive. Marx in particular spars, politely, with French anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudon. Marx\u2019s response to the elder statesman\u2019s famed pronouncement \u201cProperty is theft\u201d is an inquiry: \u201cWhose property?\u201d    The movie does not put ideas at the forefront, but it does present ideas with a solidity that\u2019s admirable. Peck\u2019s co-screenwriters Pascal Bonitzer, a longtime collaborator of the late Jacques Rivette, and the two clearly know their stuff. The movie is largely a story of personalities. Karl is fiery, brilliant, disorganized, passionate. Engels is, despite his courage and curiosity, a bit more of a wide-eyed innocent and certainly a more organized person. Their female partners do take secondary roles, but the movie depicts them as committed, innovative, and acute: true fellow travelers and comrades. The actors portraying these figures are all exciting to watch. August Diehl (who played a German major in \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d) is a fiery, sardonic, likable Marx. Stefan Konarske is a sincere, appealing Engels. Krieps\u2019 Jenny has more than a touch of slyness while Hannah Steele\u2019s Mary is appropriately fiery and proud. French great Olivier Gourmet is droll as Proudhon.    Marx and Engels\u2019 thought was genuinely revolutionary, and it\u2019s clear that Peck and Bonitzer would insist that said thought had little if anything to do with the depredations of the supposedly Marx-inspired Soviet Union. A post-diegetic text refers to Marx\u2019s \u201cKapital,\u201d noting that the work was unfinished, in part because Capital itself is ever evolving. An end credits sequence, a montage scored to a well-known '60s rock tune, attempts a precis of the evolution in very short form. It\u2019s not unpersuasive.\u00a0  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}

{"Title": "Results", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Writer/director Andrew Bujalski's latest film, \"Results,\" is his first to feature established actors (Guy Pearce, Cobie Smulders, Kevin Corrigan), and it is his version of a rom-com. What that means is that romance is a series of messy encounters and bizarre interludes, with buried motivations running the show. Human emotions are a mystery to these characters. They don't know how to speak the language of the heart, which (coincidentally) makes them seem more \"real\" than most characters in movies. In conventional rom-coms, when a character makes a heartfelt speech, it is articulate and cathartic. In \"Results,\" the characters (most of whom are physical trainers) fall back on fitness metaphors, and even as they do so they know that they aren't quite getting to the heart of the matter. Words help you access your emotions and these characters, for the most part, don't have the words. It's a very Bujalski-esque quality, awkward, prickly, irritable. \"Results\" doesn't have the inventiveness of \"Computer Chess\" (2013), and in some cases Bujalski feels out of his depth in \"Results,\" but perhaps that is just where he needs to be. \"Results\" is not entirely successful (the two main plots don't quite fit together) but it does have a charm and a style that works. In its own weird way, it is quite romantic, while acknowledging that romance is sometimes unpleasant, always messy, and hooking up with someone represents the beginning of a lifetime of getting into messes and digging oneself out. That quality alone makes \"Results\" a really refreshing film.\u00a0 Advertisement Taking place in Austin, Texas, \"Results\" introduces us to a close-knit, argumentative group of personal trainers, who all work at Power 4 Life, a gym created by the ambitious and helplessly inarticulate Trevor (Guy Pearce). Trevor has big plans: He wants to be a guru. He wants to create an entire \"philosophy\" for fitness and wellness, although he can't really articulate what that philosophy is. He wants to expand his gym to include juice bars and psychiatrists on call. The personal trainers who work for him are at each other's throats in competition for clients. When we first meet Kat (Cobie Smulders), she's on her daily run, and she chases down a car she recognizes to demand that the driver settle up late payments. Kat is ferocious and judgmental. Terrifying, really. She's also been sleeping with Trevor, her boss. They both know it's inappropriate, but they can't help it.\u00a0 Into this cloistered world of extraordinarily fit and driven people strolls the schlubby, sweaty Danny (Kevin Corrigan, in a hilarious performance). Danny is a transplant from New York, recently wealthy, holed up in an empty McMansion, playing his electric guitar in echoing rooms. For unknown reasons, he walks into Power 4 Life to sign up for training. Trevor, acting all shiny and inspirational in that desperate way that characterizes the anxious salesman, asks Danny what he's looking for and Danny, who does not know the lingo of wellness, says that he wants to know how to take a punch and not fall down. Trevor asks, \"Have you spent much time in gyms?\" Danny laughs scornfully, saying, \"Fuck no.\" Behind Trevor's desk is a poster declaring \"NO FEAR EXCUSES SURRENDER,\" but Trevor's head blocks Danny's view, and Danny expresses confusion why the poster says \"FEAR EXCUSES SURRENDER.\" This small comedic \"bit\" encapsulates the gap of understanding between the two men. They both speak English, but they can barely understand one another. Kat is assigned to train Danny.\u00a0 Kat's training sessions with Danny have a similar gap of understanding. Danny does what Kat tells him to do, but her inspirational language doesn't make a dent. It's all empty to him. He starts to obsess on her, watching Youtube videos of her workouts. It's creepy, but in a benign way. Besides, she's drawn to him too. What's Danny's deal? In the middle of the night he puts out messages on a local message board: \"I will give you $200 if you set up my television.\" Someone shows up to do that. \"I will give you $200 if you give me a cat.\" A cat shows up at the door. Danny's journey is so bizarre (is he malevolent? is he just lonely?) that it creates its own force field of energy, and when the film moves away from him to detail the relationship between Kat and Trevor, the film loses some of its charge. Danny disappears from the film for a long period of time, and the film tips over without that counter-weight.\u00a0 Advertisement There are a couple of hilarious set-pieces, beautifully filmed and performed, the main one being the chaotic dinner Kat and Trevor have with a Russian body-builder (Trevor's idol) and his submissive wife. Trevor cannot seem to stop speaking in halting homilies of inspiration, and yet he also turns into a cringing sycophant in the presence of his idol, bowing and scraping before the Great Man. The unsmiling Russian shoots down everything Trevor says in an unimpressed deadpan. The wife can barely sit down because she is so busy re-filling everyone's glasses and being a good hostess. Kat and Trevor fight with one another, using the Russian and the wife as sounding-boards. They are the worst guests ever. It's a totally screwball sequence. Bujalski's script is top-notch.\u00a0 These people, Kat and Trevor, don't know how to feel things. Or, they feel things but then resent the feelings, and go for a run to shake it off. The bond they share starts to make demands, emotional demands, and neither one handles it well or gracefully. This makes them very human. It's strangely touching, to see these two control-freak people submit to the conventions of a rom-com, spouting fitness metaphors the whole way. Love is not neat. It's a mess and \"Results\" does not try to clean up the mess.\u00a0 Guy Pearce is very funny in the role of Trevor, a good person who really cares about fitness: he's trying to create a \"brand,\" but he doesn't really understand what that means. He is not a good businessman. When he is asked to explain himself, he flounders, but all with an eager \"just hear me out\" energy that ends up being charming and almost pathetic. Cobie Smulders, so intimidating in her first appearance in the film, manages to suggest that Kat is in a bit of an existential crisis. She's almost 30. Does she have any plans? Is she good at anything else? And Kevin Corrigan, sweaty and clueless, creepy and benign, brings depth and humor to every line that comes from his mouth. He's the outsider in the main world of the film, but he becomes its compelling center.\u00a0 Advertisement Bujalski has carved out a very interesting place for himself in the world of independent film, starting with \"Funny Ha Ha\" (2002), a low-budget (putting it mildly) film about post-graduates meandering aimlessly through their lives in New York, talking endlessly, kissing each other, getting into messes, and then floundering around in the mess. \"Mutual Appreciation\" (2005) continued that trajectory, only this time in black-and-white. Most of mumblecore films were shot digitally and featured lots of improvisation, while Bujalski shot his on film and wrote detailed scripts. He is interested in the various forms that make up mainstream film and brings his own unique viewpoint to these well-established forms. \"Computer Chess\", from 2013, was an experiment in form (Many didn't care for it; I loved it.) Shot on an old Sony AVC-3260 camera and in 4:3 aspect ratio, \"Computer Chess\" looks like it actually was made in the year it takes place, 1984, and it tells the story of a group of software programmers competing in a computer chess tournament. \"Computer Chess\" was compelling visually, and extremely out there in some of its plot-points (the cats!), but it was hypnotic, entertaining and intelligent.\u00a0 \"Results\" is less focused than \"Computer Chess,\" but in a way that serves its particular story. It is interested in the emotions of people who are not accustomed to feeling emotions (besides irritation). When the characters clamp down on their softness, on their natural affinity for one another, they cause chaos in their own lives. The whole movie is chaos. And that's a good thing.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "A Coffee in Berlin", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "There's a sharp commentary at the heart of writer-director Jan Ole Gerster's debut feature, \"A Coffee in Berlin\" (originally titled \"Oh Boy\"), which swept up many of the major German film awards last year. It tells the story of Niko (Tom Schilling), a twentysomething guy who has dropped out of law school, failed to inform his father of that fact, and yet still accepts the father's funding for the schooling that no longer exists. \"A Coffee in Berlin\" has some funny things to say about the \"younger generation\" and its prolonged adolescence, its putting-off of dealing with serious matters. With themes reminiscent of \"Frances Ha,\" down to its being filmed in black-and-white, \"A Coffee in Berlin\" presents a day or so in the life of Niko, as he careens from one absurd interaction to another, clearly floundering, but still not seeing that it is up to him to create the life he wants. Not tomorrow, but right now. Advertisement What is truly delightful about the film is its loopy, gently slapstick sense of humor, its use of continuous running gags that pay off cumulatively (no small feat), and the dreamy sense that Schilling's somnambulism is pierced through only by the insane incomprehensible behavior of others. Schilling is a beautiful actor, accessible and vulnerable, and a veritable \"Everyman\" when compared to the kooks he encounters. Just one example of many: Niko has moved into a new apartment, and his nosy upstairs neighbor (Justus von Dohn\u00e1nyi) shows up at the door with a bowl of his wife's meatballs. The scene seems at first that it will be a friendly meet-and-greet until the neighbor, a big bulky guy, suddenly begins to open up about his lonely life, and how he just wants to watch football in peace, and how his wife recently had a mastectomy (he sobs, \"They took her whole rack!\"), and it ends with the man crumpling down the wall, weeping, all as Niko looks on. They have known one another 10 minutes when this operatic moment occurs. The scene is horrible. The scene is hilarious. It takes a very deft hand to handle such material: to make it both awkward and comedic, inappropriate and true. The film gains momentum as it goes along. There's a beautiful tension in every interaction. With each person Niko meets, you wait for the other shoe to drop.\u00a0He runs into an old classmate named Julika (Friederike Kempter), who seems happy to see him and yet also reminds him that he called her \"Roly Poly Julia\" back in school; she was sent to a \"boarding school for fat people\" to recover. She invites him to attend a performance-art piece put on by her theatre group, which leads to one of the funniest sequences in a film full of funny sequences. Anyone who has ever sat through an overly-earnest performance art piece and yearned to laugh, or at least inject some irony into the proceedings, will relate. There's even a movie-within-a-movie, as Niko and his friend Matze (Marc Hosemann) visit the set of a film being shot in Berlin so that Matze (an aspiring actor) can try to weasel his way into a part. One of Matze's friends plays the lead in the movie-within-a-movie, and it's the story of a romance between an SS officer and a Jewish woman. The friend, in his SS uniform, tells Niko and Matze the plot and gets so worked up by his fictional character's dilemma that he wells up with tears, all as his listeners squirm with embarrassment. Extras mill around outside, some wearing yellow stars and some wearing Swastikas, smoking cigarettes and talking shop. Advertisement The score of \"A Coffee in Berlin\" (original music composed by Cherilyn MacNeil and The Major Minors) is soft and jazzy, light and flippant, creating a comedic mood even when the actual events seem bleak. Niko confesses early on that he often doesn't understand what other people are saying to him, that they speak the same language but somehow he's not getting the message. His openness to others, and then his gentle confusion as things go south (and they always do), is part of his isolation, and also why the film is so strangely and consistently funny. Cinematographer Philipp Kirsamer manages to fill the film with a bustling sense of the urban sprawl of Berlin, with Niko making his way through all of the busses and trains and subway stations, as well as a collage-impression of a city in flux, with vacant lots, graffiti, empty squares at dawn. It's all part of the larger world with which Niko cannot seem to connect. Niko is thwarted throughout the film in his quest to get a cup of coffee. The coffee machine is broken, or the vending machine is out of order, or the urn is empty, or a simple cup of coffee costs over three Euros. As \"A Coffee in Berlin\" goes on, the lack of coffee becomes emblematic of the feeling that the world is somehow massed against him. His relationship with his dad is horrible, his finances have been cut off, Roly Poly Julia has some potential but maybe she is as nutty as everyone else, and Niko can't seem to get a foothold on meaning, relevance, or action. The continued running gag of no coffee gets an enormous emotional payoff in the film's contemplative final moment. \"A Coffee in Berlin\" veers confidently from melancholy to absurdity and back, and then back again. It's amazing that it hangs together as well as it does. The film is both silly and profound, a rare combination.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Escobar: Paradise Lost", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Few actors feel as present as Benicio Del Toro, a performer\r\nthat doesn\u2019t play-act, he embodies the characters he portrays. In \u201cEscobar:\r\nParadise Lost,\u201d Del Toro could be playing with children in a pool or ordering a\r\nyoung man to commit murder, and he performs both scenes with the same genuine\r\nintensity. He has such a keen awareness of his surroundings, whether it be his\r\nco-stars, shooting location, or even the few pounds he put on to play someone\r\nas larger than life as Pablo Escobar. He\u2019s really very good here, as he almost\r\nalways is, no matter the quality of the film around him. The rest of the movie?\r\nNot so much.

It truly will be paradise\u2014and debut\r\ndirector Andrea Di Stefano does a solid job of conveying the beauty of this\r\npart of the world. One day, Nick runs into a lovely young woman named Maria\r\n(Claudia Traisac), who asks if he\u2019s going to bring more \u201cYankees\u201d down to their\r\npart of their world. Nick politely corrects her; he\u2019s Canadian. Nick is very\r\npolite. Nick is also a tad na\u00efve. When Maria introduces him to her\r\nrich uncle Pablo Escobar, Nick doesn\u2019t exactly ask the right questions. He does\r\nhappen to wonder aloud how Uncle Pablo has so much money, to which Maria\r\ncasually answers, \u201cCocaine.\u201d Huh? You don't say. Not long later, Nick mentions over polite conversation that some\r\nlocal thugs have been giving him and his brother trouble, including attacking\r\nNick with a violent dog (in a harrowing scene). Anyone who\u2019s seen a movie will\r\nknow the thugs end up dead. And then Nick happens to be on the Escobar estate\r\non a day that he\u2019s not supposed to be there, and things get really bad. Advertisement The second half of \u201cParadise Lost\u201d is actually a pretty\r\nrobust thriller, especially a centerpiece action-suspense scene in which Nick\r\nstruggles to keep his head above water as the world is crashing around him.\r\nThere\u2019s a harrowing phone call or two and some really strong sense of setting,\r\nbuoyed by confident direction, especially for a first-time director. Here\u2019s the\r\nmoment where I realized that it\u2019s not Josh Hutcherson\u2019s fault that his\r\ncharacter doesn\u2019t really work, and not really even Di Stefano\u2019s, but the fact\r\nthat this is two movies grafted into one. On one hand, we have a true story of\r\ncrime and poverty bringing down paradise on Earth. On the other, we have the\r\nstory of an innocent caught in a web of violence. Both films kind of work, and both films are lessened by the way they are smashed together here. Were this just a straightforward,\r\nfictional thriller, it might be pretty effective. But it\u2019s not. The name is right there in the title. And\r\nevery time that Benicio Del Toro shows up as Pablo Escobar, we\u2019re reminded of\r\nthe movie that this could have been, making it easier to criticize the movie it\r\nchose to be instead.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Monuments Men", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"The Monuments Men\" tests the proposition that an appealing cast can put almost any script across. Near the start of this World War II drama about Yanks searching for art stolen by the Germans, star\u00a0George Clooney asks, \"Who will make sure that the statue of David is still standing and the Mona Lisa is still smiling?\" and the audience thinks, \"Why you, George, and your merry band of character actors playing over-the-hill soldiers, and us, if we can tag along too.\" By the midway point, that rah-rah sentiment has downshifted to, \"You guys, I guess\u2014and where are we now?\" By the end, it's something like, \"Wake me when you find that statue you're always talking about.\" Advertisement That's a harsh assessment of a film whose heart is in the right place, but heart alone does not a good film make. Directed by Clooney from a script he wrote with his regular filmmaking partner Grant Heslov, \"The Monuments Men\" is a throwback to a very specific type of World War II adventure picture: a star-studded adventure made between ten and 20 years after the war's end. Such films were aimed at a morally exhausted U.S. audience that wanted to be congratulated for its role in ending tyranny\u2014however large or small or nonexistent it might have been\u2014but that also wished to be entertained, preferably with a caper, a romance, and knowing jokes about bureaucrats and regulations.\u00a0 Clooney and Heslov's film offers all these elements, plus an alternately rousing and lyrical score by Alexandre Desplat that evokes \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" and \"The Great Escape.\" (Brass, kettle drums, whistling.) As the movie sends Clooney, Matt Damon, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville and Jean Dujardin\u2014playing art historians or art experts of one kind or another\u2014in search of German-pilfered paintings and statuary, it adds something else as well: an appreciation of how hard it is to get people to care about art when cities have been reduced to rubble and whole populations wiped out.\u00a0 The movie's best quality is its willingness to be real about the heroes' prospects and illustrate how hard it is to make a moral or philosophical case for their mission when millions have already died. When a field officer informs Clooney's Frank Stokes that even though a particular church contains significant art, they'll still bomb it if Germans decide to use it as a hiding place, you understand in practical terms where he's coming from, because the lead-up to this conversation took you to the beach at Normandy, post-D-Day, then past many bombed-out cityscapes. \"The Monuments Men\" presents its heroes as mice skittering through the margins of history, trying not to get stepped on. They're mostly too old or out-of-shape to be effective soldiers, and they're aware that the combat troops they pass in the field would support their mission only to the point where they had to choose between saving a Picasso and getting shot. Advertisement John Frankenheimer's action thriller \"The Train,\" starring Burt Lancaster as a French resistance fighter trying to stop Germans from looting the country's art at the end of the war, covered these themes in some depth, but with a grimy, sinewy, immediate quality. \"The Monuments Men\" is going for something different: a realistic portrait of wartime, one that shows the heroes being thwarted by higher-ups who aren't bad people but just have different priorities, and that isn't afraid to wander off into nooks and crannies of the main plot and let its characters hang out and just exist.\u00a0 This would all be wonderful news if the film had a discernible shape and a bit of cinematic flair. Unfortunately, it's the most visually un-dynamic film George Clooney has ever directed, a succession of plain vanilla long-shots and closeups that betray no sense of how to block actors within a moving frame. (Odd how each new film Clooney makes is\u00a0less\u00a0visually interesting than the one before; it's as if you're witnessing a learning curve in reverse.)\u00a0Clooney and Heslov's screenplay, meanwhile, amounts to a series of handsomely decorated, intelligently acted, pleasantly shaped, sometimes amusing scenes that ultimately don't add up to much. The not-quite-romantic subplot between Damon's character and Cate Blanchett\u2014cast as a Belgian secretary for the German who's organizing most of the art thievery\u2014is not charming, not sexy, and ultimately doesn't even make much dramatic sense; there are more botched subplots where that one came from.\u00a0Every now and then, Clooney will chime in via voice-over to tell you where everyone's going, or what that scene that just ended meant to the unit, and to the mission. The narration is so slapped-together-sounding that you can picture the star in a recording studio scribbling lines on a legal tablet while viewing a scene that's not coming across, recording a passage in his affably gruff voice, then turning to the booth to say, \"I'm thinking maybe one more take, but this time without the word 'deployed.'\"\u00a0 Every now and then, \"The Monuments Men\" produces a memorably charming or haunting moment. There's an appropriately underplayed sequence of the men discovering a wooden barrel filled with tiny, misshapen bits of gold, then riding a freight elevator in silence as they think about where the bits came from. There's a fine comic scene of Balaban instantly seeing through a deception, but taking his sweet time exposing it because he's trying to get his mind around how stunningly obvious it is. The initial \"getting the team together\" montage has a brief close-up that reminds of what a truly great actor John Goodman is: he suggests a character's entire self-image through the jaunty way he cocks his helmet.\u00a0This is not a terrible movie. It's just not consistently good enough to get excited about. It's the kind of film that you'll stumble across on TV, watch for a few minutes thinking, \"This is all right, I don't know why everybody was so hard on it,\" then change the channel.

{"Title": "Under the Skin", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Is \"Under the Skin,\" in which Scarlett Johansson plays a mysterious woman luring men into a fatal mating dance, a brilliant science fiction movie\u2014more of an \"experience\" than a traditional story, with plenty to say about gender roles, sexism and the power of lust? Is it a pretentious gloss on a very old story about men's fear of women, and women's discomfort with their own allure? Does it contain mysteries that can only be unpacked with repeat viewings, or is it a shallow film whose assured style and eerie tone make it seem deeper than it is? Is there, in fact, something beneath the movie's skin? Why is every sentence in this paragraph a question? Advertisement I can answer that last one: \"Under the Skin,\" Jonathan Glazer's first film since 2004's \"Birth,\" is special because it's hard to pin down. It doesn't move or feel like most science fiction movies\u2014like most movies, period. It's a film out of its time. Its time, I think, is the 1970s, when directors like Alejandro Jodorowsky (\"El Topo,\" \"The Holy Mountain\") and Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now,\" \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\") made viscerally intense features with subjective visuals and sound effects and music and dissociative editing.\u00a0Certain modern filmmakers still work in this mode occasionally\u2014for instance, the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, whose 1998 film \"A Taste of Cherry\" shares some odd similarities with \"Under the Skin.\" As you watch any of those films, you think about what they're trying to say, or what they \"mean,\" or on a much simpler level, what the heck is happening from one minute to the next. But at a certain point you realize that on the simplest level, such films are saying: \"Here is an experience that's nothing like yours, and here are some images and sounds and situations that capture the essence of what the experience felt like; watch the movie for a couple of hours, and when it's over, go home and think about what you saw and what it did to you.\" \u00a0 The opening of \"Under the Skin\" might remind you of the openings of \"2001,\" \"Blade Runner\" or \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" or certain movies by Paul Thomas Anderson: an immersive, hypnotic gambit that feels like the mental equivalent of a palate cleanser. As Mica Levi's score buzzes like an otherworldly hornet's nest, we see a black screen with a tiny white dot in the middle. The dot grows incrementally larger, or closer, before shaping itself into a pattern of rings that simultaneously suggests a birth canal dilating, the stages of a rocket separating, and a lunar eclipse as seen through a telescope's lens. What's happening? The movie doesn't exactly tell us. Maybe this is the heroine, Johansson's character, falling to earth, or landing on earth. Maybe. Then see a man on a motorcycle retrieving the body of a young woman (also Johansson) and the woman donning her body as one might don a set of clothes. Who is the motorcyclist? Is he her mate? Her procurer? Her handler? Who is she? An astronaut? The vanguard in an alien invasion? An intergalactic sex tourist visiting Earth as an American might visit Amsterdam or Bangkok?\u00a0The opening is the first of many sequences in \"Under the Skin\" that feel more figurative than \"real\"\u2014moments in which we suspect we're seeing the poetic representation of a thing, not necessarily the thing itself.\u00a0 Most of the movie does, however, feel \"real,\" particularly scenes of the woman driving around Glasgow, Scotland, enticing men to get into her white van and follow her to an abandoned flat where, it is implied, they have sex. The men (shot by hidden cameras in a series of improvisations) seem like real men. They aren't movie star handsome. They're young, alert and engaging. Some are funny and seem like they might even have a chance with an attractive young woman who was not an extraterrestrial looking for a hookup. The unnamed heroine seems genuinely intrigued by their banter, sometimes amused, never in a condescending way. She seems to be learning about this new environment and the people in it, and enjoying herself when she isn't anxious about passing for human.\u00a0 Advertisement But once we join the woman and her men in the vacant apartment, the film turns figurative again. The men follow the heroine through a pitch black doorway that's yet another symbolically charged portal; it's as if, by stepping through it, both she and they are being born, or reborn. Once the couples step through, we don't see any sex, just nudity plus movement, in what might be a musical number choreographed by performance artists. The frame is completely black except for the woman and her prey. They both take their clothes off, item by item. The woman always backs away from the man, slowly, confidently, but with an eerily blank expression (most of Johansson's expressions are eerily blank, except when she's unexpectedly laughing or showing confusion or fear). The man walks forward, but seems to trudge lower and lower into a black pool. The heroine, meanwhile, continues to walk backward on the pool's undisturbed surface.\u00a0 The leading lady gives a performance different from any you've seen from her. It's keenly attuned to the movie's aesthetic. It's more about intuition and gesture than dialogue.\u00a0Johansson has to be at once achingly specific and so general that you can hang symbols on her. She pulls it off. And somehow Johansson, Glazer and his cinematographer Daniel Landin transform how we think of this star. They've taken one of the most glamorous actresses of the modern era\u2014a woman whose looks have been abstracted into hubba-hubba caricature in most films, and on awards shows\u2014and ironically restored her earthliness by having her play a creature not of this earth. They've made her beautiful in a real way, with hips and blemishes and folds in her skin.\u00a0 There are hints of an unspoken psychic bond between the woman driving around in the white van picking up men and the mysterious motorcyclist zipping around Glasgow, hugging the curves of hilly roads that dip and snake like the ones in the opening sequence of \"The Shining\"\u2014but we never find out precisely what the connection is.\u00a0There are times when the heroine is a vessel emptied of meaning. Other times she seems like a human struggling to learn the subtle everyday details of a new culture. She speaks in an English accent, the men in thick Scottish accents. The absence of subtitles adds to the feeling that she's a stranger in a strange land, and makes us empathize with her as we try to understand the men. We study their facial expressions and gestures to plug gaps in meaning.\u00a0 Advertisement She's the woman as Other, yet she's also \"just\" a woman, or \"just\" an alien creature. She is everything and nothing.\u00a0There are times when the film seems to be too freighted with meaning, as if inviting scholars to write thesis papers analyzing its masculine and feminine symbols. At other times it seems to be deliberately mocking such impulses, giving false clues to literal-minded viewers who insist on trying to \"solve\" movies like equations. But the film's disturbing finale goes beyond such simplistic \"this=that\" analysis. First it removes all doubt as to who the heroine is\u2014what her \"secret\" is. Then goes beyond such questions, so that you feel a mix of despair and wonder not unlike what you'd feel at the end of a melodrama, or a Grimm fairy tale whose ending, however dreadful, is not depressing because it feels\u00a0right. \u00a0 Movies like this don't find their way into commercial cinemas very often. When they do, they don't tend to star anyone you've heard of. When a film comes along that doesn't fit the usual marketplace paradigms, such as \"The Tree of Life\" or \"Upstream Color\" or \"Spring Breakers,\" you take notice. \"Under the Skin\" is a film in that vein. Right after it ended, I argued its merits with a friend who didn't care for it, and I jokingly referred to it as \"what would happen if Michelangelo Antonioni directed 'Species.'\" It sounds like a glib joke, but I meant it as a compliment to the movie's mix of horror film menace and intellectualized control. It seems to hard to believe today, now that the pantheon of great directors has hardened into consensus, but there was a time when people thought there was less to Antonioni than met the eye, too. On the basis of this film, \"Birth\" and his debut \"Sexy Beast,\" Glazer strikes me as a director in the same weight class as Antonioni and all the other great filmmakers I've name-dropped in this piece, including Kubrick, the artist Glazer most often evokes. (Like Kubrick, Glazer takes his time\u2014this is only his third feature in 13 years\u2014and like Kubrick, he becomes more formally audacious, technically innovative, and inscrutable with each new work.) I wanted to watch \"Under the Skin\" more than once before I reviewed it. Life got in the way of that. No matter: I feel secure in saying that it's going to end up on my list of the year's best movies. I saw it almost a week ago and it has never been far from my mind. Is it perfect? Probably not. It might be too much of something, or too little of something else. Time will sort out the particulars. But I do know that the movie's sensibility is as distinctive as any I've seen. \"Under the Skin\" is hideously beautiful. Its life force is overwhelming.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Rob the Mob", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In 1991, as New York City stopped in its tracks to follow the trial of mob boss John Gotti, a story briefly took over the front pages, a sideshow to the main event: a crazy in-love couple from Queens, taking advantage of the chaos in the organized crime world, started holding up various Mafia social clubs, pocketing the cash. They knew the Mob wouldn't contact the police. And was it really a crime to steal from such obviously bad guys in the first place? \"Rob the Mob,\" directed by Raymond De Felitta and written by Jonathan Fernandez, looks at the sideshow from multiple angles. Breezy, sleazy, and sometimes-intense, \"Rob the Mob\" depicts a very specific sliver of time in New York history, a time overrun by crack, graffiti, and omnipresent organized crime.  Advertisement Tommy (Michael Pitt) and Rosie Uva (Nina Arianda) have recently emerged from short stints in prison for holding up a florist's shop. They are in love. Rosie has gotten a job at a debt collection agency, run by a smiling enthusiastic guy (Griffin Dunne) who likes to hire ex-cons (he himself did time for fraud). Rosie, a woman with an ingratiating supportive attitude and a big laugh which masks her intellectual shortcomings, convinces her boss to also hire Tommy. When money is tight one month, they decide on their reckless quick-cash crime spree. Rosie drives the get-away car and Tommy, wearing a ski-mask, does the stick-up, accidentally firing off the Uzi into the ceiling and back walls. The group of \"wise guys\" in the club empty their wallets, all while issuing threats of what they will do when they track him down. When Tommy and Rosie go home to their bleak cold-water flat, they laugh and commiserate over how easy it was.  \"Rob the Mob\" doesn't just stick with Tommy and Rosie. It looks at their crime spree from the perspective of the dogged Federal agent (Frank Whaley) searching for specific Intel on the structure and hierarchy of the New York crime families. We also meet a journalist named Jerry Cardozo (an excellent Ray Romano) who has been covering the Mob for 30 years, and writes a front page story about the mysterious criminal duo, naming them \"Bonnie and Clyde\". He is shocked when, one day, Rosie calls him at his desk to correct one of the facts in his story. We also get scenes of the paranoia within the Mob, brought on by the one-two punch of the Gotti trial and the sudden crime spree. The Mafia here is headed up by a reclusive boss with a mysterious past named \"Big Al\" (played by Andy Garcia, with a white Ernest Hemingway beard in a performance of coiled intensity.)  During one of their stick-ups, Tommy and Rosie steal the wallet of a guy named Joey D. (Burt Young). In the wallet is a folded piece of loose leaf paper, and on it is written what becomes known as \"The List\": a family tree of the Mob, its internal structure, its command set-up. Private home phone numbers are listed. As the Gotti trial goes on downtown, police and FBI work overtime trying to figure out who reported to whom in the organization, and, of course, there is no H.R. department. \"The List\" would represent the break they need. But Tommy and Rosie, whose bravery explodes into increasing delusional mania with each successful stick-up, decide to use \"The List\" as a bargaining chip with the Mob, and they start making threatening phone calls to everyone on it.  Advertisement \"Rob the Mob\" romanticizes Tommy and Rosie, filming them in slo-mo dancing through raining dollar bills, and kissing in the rain on a deserted Coney Island boardwalk, but the couple lacks the iconic power of other famous crime-spree cinematic duos, including their namesake. The romantic treatment of some of their scenes and the sentimental soundtrack is all counter-acted by casting Pitt and Arianda, who inhabit their roles familiarly, grubbily, easily. Both actors portray characters who are clearly not smart, not even a little bit, but they do so without being patronizing about it. You don't get the sense that they, the actors, are \"slumming\". Tommy and Rosie have no self-awareness, and no powers of self-reflection. Tony award-winning Arianda, in particular, is fascinating to watch. She was fascinating to watch in her small part in \"Midnight in Paris,\" where she droningly and happily repeated whatever her snobby husband said. Arianda's Rosie is filled with enthusiasm and support for those around her (watch, in particular, how she butters up her boss, cheering him on like they're at a pep rally), and despite her initial resistance to Tommy's plan, she finally embraces it wholeheartedly. She's not killing anyone. She's stealing from bad men. \"What's the crime in that?\" she asks Cardoza, grinning at him chummily over her slice of pizza. Arianda shows Rosie's shallow grasp of abstract concepts in a frozen smile and confused flicker in her eyes when confronted with something she doesn't understand. Cardoza says to her, \"We got a saying in the newspaper world--\" and she cuts him off, brightly, supportively, missing the entire point: \"I love sayings! Slogans!\"  The rest of the cast is populated by stalwart long-time New York actors, grounding the film in its location and era. Cathy Moriarty shows up in a heartbreaking cameo as Tommy's devastated mother, wrecked by a lifetime of disappointment and violence. Moriarty gives another unforgettable cameo performance in the upcoming \"The Double\". It's exciting to think of the direction her career is taking.  \"Rob the Mob\" is too cutesy a title for this dark grubby little tale.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Being Evel", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Does the world really need another movie about Evel Knievel?\r\nWell it depends. The pioneering (in a sense) motorcycle daredevil has already\r\nbeen the subject of two fiction films\r\n(one in which he played himself, or \u201chimself\u201d), one self-produced documentary,\r\na good number of television specials and retrospectives. Knievel himself passed\r\naway in 2007\u2014not in any kind of stunt accident but rather from a pulmonary\r\nailment, exacerbated, reportedly, by Hepatitis C, which the performer likely\r\ncontracted from one of countless blood transfusions\u2014and the above-mentioned\r\nmovies have long been forgotten by all but the most dedicated cultists. Which\r\nis, in a way, too bad. The first fictional Knievel movie, in 1971, starred George\r\nHamilton as the cycle maniac and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Lolita, Sue Lyon, as his\r\nwife. 1977\u2019s \u201cViva Knievel,\u201d which featured\r\nthe man himself at the height of his hubris (he didn\u2019t cotton to having been\r\nplayed by Hamilton six years before) costarred Gene Kelly (!) and was directed\r\nby deft Hollywood journeyman Gordon Douglas. Given Knievel\u2019s general\r\ndisposition at the height of his fame, directing him is (to paraphrase Steve\r\nAlbini) a job I wouldn\u2019t wish on a dog I didn\u2019t like.  Advertisement Anyway. The point is that the phenomenon that was Evel\r\nKnievel\u2014and he was indeed a phenom\u2014doesn\u2019t get much recognition in contemporary\r\nculture, despite the fact that, as interview subject and co-producer of the\r\nmovie Johnny Knoxville notes early on, the guy kind of invented extreme sports.\r\nThis highly conventional, intermittently\r\nengaging example of the Entertainment Documentary (you know, the kind that\r\nlivens up its talking heads with rear-projected imagery behind them, and\r\nfeatures animated reenactments, that sort of thing) outlines how this cocky kid\r\nfrom Butte, Montana became a post P.T. Barnum icon by essentially risking\r\nsuicide every time he got on a chopper. Discovering early on that he was kind\r\nof thrill crazy, he started using his cycle to jump over cars without any kind\r\nof mathematical calculation or preparation. He just got the cars lined up, put\r\nup the ramps, and went. This method held for quite some time, up to his\r\nill-fated but fame-producing missed-it-by-that-much jump over the fountains of\r\nVegas\u2019 Caesar\u2019s Palace and beyond.  This haphazard approach led to spectacular successes and\r\nperhaps even more spectacular failures. The footage of his crash after clearing\r\nthe Vegas fountains was the most replayed clip of its time. Similarly\r\ncringe-inducing is a scene from earlier in his career, in which he tries to\r\njump over an oncoming cycle, misjudges the timing, and takes a horrific spill.\r\nThe guy had a capacity for physical punishment that was equal to if not greater\r\nthan his talent for self-promotion. The movie interviews dozens of sports and\r\nmedia figures, including the recently passed Frank Gifford, who interviewed\r\nKnievel frequently on \u201cWide World Of Sports,\u201d and they all have wild, hairy\r\nstories of Knievel\u2019s bravery and wiliness. There\u2019s also bracing period footage\r\nof Knievel being a scowling jackass at Snake River Canyon, the site of one of\r\nhis most poorly conceived stunts, in which he attempted to rocket over the\r\naforementioned geological gap after being thwarted for over a decade in his\r\nquest to jump something over the\r\nGrand Canyon.  The movie is certainly colorful\u2014this is a guy who, when he\r\nhad it made, lived VERY large, even if he continued on what seemed like a quest\r\nto break every bone in his body multiple times. And it tells, as it keeps\r\nreminding us, a very American story. For all that, though, it doesn\u2019t\r\nilluminate the guy\u2019s character beyond what\u2019s obvious. Nor does it bestow much\r\ndepth upon Knievel. No, he\u2019s not a monster on the level of Jack \u201cPal\u201d Smurch in\r\nJames Thurber\u2019s caustic short story \u201cThe Greatest Man In The World.\u201d Although\r\nhe\u2019s depicted as behaving pretty badly, particularly with respect to\r\nwomen-chasing, what he does isn\u2019t all that unusual in the annals of late 20th\u00a0Century rags-to-riches guys who become dickheads when they\u2019ve got some cash in\r\ntheir pockets. There is, finally, even\r\nin his most vividly temper-flaring moments, something of a cipher about him.\r\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the movie (competently directed by Daniel Junge, also\r\nof \u201cA LEGO Brickumentary\u201d) or if it\u2019s\r\nhim.

Kayla wants in on the shared experience, and decides she\u2019ll do the deed with Connor (Miles Robbins), and Sam, even though she\u2019s way more interested in a lesbian at her school named Marcie (Sarayu Blue), decides she\u2019ll join in as well with her date. As the trio of couples head out on a night of debauchery, Julie accidentally leaves a group chat open on her laptop and the girls\u2019 parents, in a very funny scene, decipher the emojis and discern the plan. Even though Hunter initially balks, they head out to save the girls from doing something they\u2019ll regret.    Advertisement Despite what you may have thought from the trailers, Cannon is careful not to deliver a comedy that relies on the double standard that has long-defined teenage boys and girls regarding sex. In fact, Julie and Mitchell are constantly being called out on their bullshit. Lisa had Julie at a young age, and doesn\u2019t want the same for her daughter, but it\u2019s also crystal-clear that Julie is in love with Austin and this is no mere hook-up. In \"Blockers,\"\u00a0sex, and experimentation in general,\u00a0is treated as a natural part of the evolution into adulthood and it\u2019s the parents trying to hold it back who are the relics. Some of the best parts of\u00a0\u201cBlockers\u201d make it clear how much being overprotective leaves you stuck in time, and presents the teens as progressive/woke/etc. in a clever, modern way. Clearly, there are some decent ideas for a comedy in \u201cBlockers,\u201d and some very funny scenes from a cast with rock-solid comic timing, but the movie was either rewritten one too many times or one too few. Whatever the case, it\u2019s an understatement to say that it\u2019s all over the map tonally. The first half-hour or so really worked for me, as it became clear how much Cannon could get from a talented cast (not just the adults, but the kids work too, especially scene-stealer Viswanathan), but then \u201cBlockers\u201d falls into that trap where every subsequent scene has to up the ante in terms of insanity. It loses the emotional grounding that feels genuine in the opening scenes as the drugs, booze, and lunacy gets turned up to 11 in an effort to \u201ctop\u201d something like \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d or \u201cSuperbad.\u201d \u201cBlockers\u201d has five credited writers (Ed.-It did at SXSW but has since been reduced to two), and you would be able to guess that if I hadn't told you. It\u2019s just\u00a0incredibly difficult to balance the wildly divergent tones in a movie that features more sex jokes than any I\u2019ve seen in years with characters that feel real talking about going away to school and leaving their parents and friends.\u00a0 With that in mind, it\u2019s notable how close \u201cBlockers\u201d gets to working. The crowd I saw it with at SXSW\u2014a festival that\u2019s become notable for mainstream comedy debuts, launching \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d and more in recent years\u2014ate it up and used words like hysterical on their way out. The film is\u00a0undeniably funny, and I\u2019d like a world in which Cena/Mann/Barinholtz get more work\u2014AND, even more importantly, where more female directors are hired to direct R-rated studio\u00a0comedies. I just hope the next one is a little better than \u201cBlockers.\u201d This review was filed from the 2018 SXSW Film Festival on March 11, 2018. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Sicario", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cSicario\u201d opens with two indicators of a violent world, one a discovery and one an explosion, both setting the stage for the satisfying thriller that follows.\u00a0This is a universe in which evidence of evil exists in plain sight,\r\nhiding in the walls of a house in suburban America. And it is a world in which\r\nviolence can erupt in the blink of an eye, taking lives and shattering others.\r\nAt times, \u201cSicario\u201d is a deeply satisfying, intense examination of a war with\r\nno rules of engagement, driven by a spectacular performance by Benicio Del Toro\r\nand typically mesmerizing cinematography from Roger Deakins. At other times, especially\r\nin its middle act, \u201cSicario\u201d can be frustratingly self-indulgent, filled with\r\noverhead helicopter shots of the Mexican border and a thumping, pretentious\r\nscore. It\u2019s a film that lacks the urgency of the really great thrillers, but\r\nexists in that rarefied air of refined production values on every level and a\r\nflawless ensemble. That it falls short of greatness could be considered a\r\ndisappointment, but there\u2019s still much to like here. Advertisement That opening scene features FBI Agent Kate Macy (Emily\r\nBlunt) trying to find a kidnap victim in an Arizona home. She literally barrels\r\nthrough the wall in her truck, and just takes down a target as he unloads a\r\nshotgun in her direction. The shotgun blasts a hole in the wall, revealing a\r\ndead body, wrapped in plastic. And this cadaver is not alone. Soon, they\r\ndiscover the home is filled with corpses, and their investigation leads to an\r\nexplosion. What is going on? What horror has crossed the border from the\r\nnotoriously lawless town of Juarez to Arizona?  Macy\u2019s fearlessness and quick wit draws the attention of her\r\nsuperiors, and she\u2019s brought in on a meeting for an inter-agency task force.\r\nLed by a mysterious, professionally undefined (he could be CIA) man named Matt\r\n(Josh Brolin), the people behind this task force like what they hear from Kate.\r\nThey bring her aboard, and Matt, Kate and the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del\r\nToro) head South to capture a drug trafficker and bring him back to the States for\r\nquestioning. This sequence alone justifies a look at \u201cSicario.\u201d Venturing into\r\na part of the continent in which drug lords have become so prominent that dead\r\nbodies hang in public places as messages, the team has to act quickly. On the\r\nway back from Mexico, they get stuck in traffic at the border. Cars around them\r\ncould contain the drug trafficker\u2019s cronies, waiting to strike. This scene is\r\na master class in the production of tension. Deakins uses car windows\r\nbeautifully and editor Joe Walker seamlessly cuts the action together. That the\r\nmovie never tops this sequence again is where the problems arguably start. We\r\nopen with such intensity that the lack of sizzle in the second act starts to\r\ntake a toll. Part of the problem is that Taylor Sheridan\u2019s script doesn\u2019t\r\nreally develop a protagonist. Kate is too often an observer, an unwilling and\r\nuninformed traveler on this journey. Brolin\u2019s Matt and Del Toro\u2019s Alejandro are\r\nso clearly in charge of what\u2019s happening that they\u2019re thinking of moves several\r\nmachinations away while Kate is unclear of not only what role she\u2019s supposed to\r\nplay but what roles everyone has as well. I get that this sense of confusion is\r\npart of the point. \u201cSicario,\u201d at its core, is about a world in which the lack\r\nof leadership on either side of the drug war has created complete chaos. And so\r\nit makes sense that it would feature a protagonist equally confused by the lack\r\nof ground rules. However, this makes for a film that doesn\u2019t have the emotional\r\npunch of the best thrillers, at least not until the final act when the tables\r\nare turned, and we realize that we may have been focusing on the wrong story all\r\nalong. Advertisement Despite the issues I have with the narrative of \u201cSicario,\u201d\r\nit\u2019s impossible to deny the technical elements that are so far above average,\r\nand Denis Villeneuve\u2019s skill with directing actors. He draws a great performance\r\nfrom Brolin as the kind of guy who enjoys keeping those around him uninformed.\r\nHe considers intelligence as a tool to an upper hand. Del Toro has a very\r\ndifferent purpose, one that\u2019s slowly revealed, and he\u2019s simply magnetic here.\r\nHe steals every scene he\u2019s in. Blunt is typically excellent as well, even if it\r\nfeels like the underdrawn nature of her character is the film\u2019s biggest flaw. By the time \u201cSicario\u201d gets to its final act, and Villeneuve\r\nand Deakins approach \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d territory through strikes under the cover of darkness with night vision goggles,\r\nit\u2019s impossible to nitpick the screenplay. When life and death are in play,\r\nsuch as in that scene on the freeway, and really the entire final act, \u201cSicario\u201d\r\nrises to the level I hoped it would maintain the entire time. It becomes an\r\nentire film of that opening scene\u2014a movie of secrets and the threat of constant\r\nviolence. It\u2019s about a world that we can\u2019t really even comprehend\r\nwhen it comes to its lack of order and degree of atrocities. And it\u2019s in our\r\nbackyard.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Our Kind of Traitor", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The work of the British novelist John le Carr\u00e9 is inextricably linked, in the minds of many readers, with the Cold War. But he, like many others plugged into current events, has long understood that the fall of the Soviet Union did not, by any means, put an end to Russian, British and American-accented espionage hijinks. His 2010 novel, \u201cOur Kind of Traitor,\u201d capitalizes on explicit links between high profit gangsterism in the former USSR and government corruption in the West, whose self-righteous self-image is just one reason it likes to keep such things tightly under wraps.\u00a0 Advertisement \n The movie adaptation, directed by Susanna White and starring Ewan McGregor, Naomie Harris, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Damian Lewis, is a handsome and often absorbing picture. It begins with the depiction of an unusual ceremony, culminating in the bestowal of a pistol on someone we believe to be a lucky dealmaker; as is the custom in old gangster movies, however, the gift is in fact a \u201cmarked for death\u201d gesture, and several bleakly depicted murders follow, in the snow, yet. Cut to the altogether sultrier climes of Marrakesh, where McGregor\u2019s Perry Makepeace (nice name, John) is unsuccessfully trying to warm up longtime girlfriend Gail (Harris). A rift has occurred in their relationship, a bad one. And while it\u2019s not revealed for a while just what it was, it seems highly ill-advised for Perry, once by himself, to accept the invitation of a blustery Russian named Dima (Skarsg\u00e5rd) to go out and party with him. But go out and party with him he does, and while he\u2019s entranced by visions of (probable) call girls riding horses through the hallways of the site of the revels, he\u2019s also got sufficient conscience to step in and break up a sexual assault. Dima admires Perry\u2019s nerve, or stupidity, in this incident: the would-be rapist, a heavily tattooed ape, is, like Dima, a Russian mobster. Dima deems Perry either noble enough, or stupid enough, to entrust, and enlists him as a sort of carrier pigeon: Perry is to bring British intelligence a teaser of some incriminating evidence that Dima is willing to part with in exchange for safe haven for himself and his family in Britain. Seems he\u2019s under the impression that someone is going to be gifting him with a special pistol some time soon.\u00a0 \n Perry agrees, Gail semi-balks, and soon enough they\u2019re embroiled in a scheme headed by an agent who happens to have an agenda of his own pertaining to one of the British bigwigs on Dima\u2019s list of the corrupt. Far from a simple courier, Perry becomes a major player in the deal. Gail and Perry see their relationship healing as they get to know Dima and his family, and develop protective instincts toward them. Perry\u2019s a professor of poetics, and we see him teaching T.S. Eliot, and evoking Dante, one of Eliot\u2019s great heroes. Later in the movie a character speaks of a certain kind of espionage work as being for \u201cpeople disillusioned with their lives, who have lost their way \u2026 giv[ing] them back a sense of purpose.\u201d Which of course evokes the opening of Dante\u2019s \u201cDivine Comedy,\u201d in which the protagonist, at middle age, finds himself lost in a forest. And the movie ends with a shot that evokes both Eliot\u2019s \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d and the video for Yes\u2019 \u201cOwner of a Lonely Heart.\u201d These touches are a bit heavyhanded, to be honest, even as the movie\u2019s action, featuring train travel to secret rendezvous spots and other pleasing bits of spy movie spycraft, will prove a pleasure to the genre fan. While White\u2019s direction is atmospheric, the sense of tension never gets crucial; the movie\u2019s got more of a mood of resignation than of conflict. For all its respectful and respectable qualities, it also suffers from a certain inertia.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Private Violence", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In the recent uproar following the release of the video footage showing  Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punching his wife Janay in the  elevator, a hashtag started trending on Twitter: #WhyIStayed. Beverly  Gooden, from North Carolina, did not watch the elevator footage, but  heard the commentary, the overwhelming refrain being, \"Why didn't she  just leave?\" A survivor of domestic violence herself, Gooden went on  Twitter and began a series of Tweets about why she stayed. The hashtag  started trending, as more and more people started sharing their stories.  It made national news. HBO's new feature-length documentary, \"Private  Violence,\" directed by Cynthia Hill, has been over a decade in the  making, but its release could not come at a more opportune time. A look  at the complexity of domestic violence, especially when it comes to the  difficulty of prosecuting abusers in a court of law, \"Private Violence\" keeps its focus narrow, a smart choice, following around Kit Gruelle, a victims' advocate from North Carolina. Advertisement Kit Gruelle lives in the mountains of North Carolina, and works with  women's shelters and law enforcement on various domestic abuse cases  about to enter the court system. She also trains first responders,  police officers and hostage negotiators on the complexities of what  goes on in domestic abuse situations. There is a fascinating scene  showing a role-playing scenario where two cops in training interview an  arguing \"couple\" (in reality, domestic abuse advocates). The cops  afterwards are taught what they did right, what they did wrong, what  signals they missed and what red flags they ignored. This is very important  work. Misconceptions and preconceived notions, not to mention  prejudices and judgmental attitudes, leave victims at risk. As a survivor of an abusive relationship herself, Gruelle is able to  communicate powerfully to those who cannot understand why people stay in  violent situations, and why they often keep going back. At one point, when  describing her own relationship, Gruelle says, \"I would always go back  because at least then I knew where he was.\" \"Private Violence\" highlights the diversity of  Gruelle's tasks, featuring her driving around from courthouses to  shelters to doctor's offices, back to her home in the mountains. There  are a couple of moments where Gruelle is shown listening to something,  the testimony of a survivor, or, in one scene, a terrible tape sent to  her of a man whipping his wife, screaming \"Don't you ever cross me!,\" and,  in those scenes, Hill zooms in on Gruelle's eyes, catching the  intensity of the listening going on there. Those are riveting and  empathetic moments. One can see why Hill was so taken with Gruelle as a  subject. \"Private Violence\" also presents the horrifying case of Deanna Walters, a woman kidnapped by her husband  and driven across the country against her will with their 2 1/2-year-old  daughter. He beat Deanna all along the way; so badly in Oklahoma that  he almost killed her. The police officer who finally pulled the truck  over and called an ambulance, said, \"In the 15 years I've been a law  enforcement officer, I've never seen anybody in a car wreck as badly  beat up as that girl.\" However, Deanna's husband was not charged with  anything and allowed to return home to North Carolina. Deanna's daughter  was placed in foster care (Deanna saying, quietly, \"That destroyed  me.\") Because the two had crossed so many state lines, and because  Deanna didn't know what state she was in half the time, there was fear  that the case would get lost in the shuffle, and that nobody would want  to prosecute it on a state-level. Gruelle and others hoped that his  multiple crimes (kidnapping, assault) could be tried in a federal court  where the punishment might be steeper. (Gruelle is quick to point out  the terrible irony that kidnapping is a worse offense in the eyes of the  law than beating someone so badly she almost dies and continues to have  seizures as a result of the beating.) Deanna Walters had been asked  repeatedly, by friends, family, and then law enforcement and lawyers,  the common question: \"Why didn't you leave him?\" Gruelle points out:  Deanna did leave him. And he retaliated by kidnapping  her and then almost killing her. Advertisement \"Private Violence\" is the story the important  work of Gruelle, of Deanna Walters' case, and of the American court  system, the giant loopholes in the law, and the multiple problems with  enforcing restraining orders (as well as prosecuting those who violate  such orders.) Gruelle, appearing on a radio show, comes with a stack of  files over a foot high of restraining orders that had been violated, resulting in the women being murdered. Gruelle says, \"I refer to  restraining orders as a last will and testament.\" As long as survivors are asked \"Why didn't you just leave?\" there will  be a need for advocates such as Kit Gruelle. And as long as there are  people out there like Gruelle, doing the frustrating and often thankless  work of not only keeping victims safe but bringing their abusers to  justice, there is hope. \"Private Violence\" is extremely sad, but it has a lot of hope. \"Private Violence\" opened Friday in limited release and plays tonight, October 20, 2014 on HBO.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Ridiculous 6", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "I\u2019ll be honest. While I really do try not to form any\r\nopinion at all before watching a film, I approached Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d with some understandable trepidation. The stories of a script so racist\r\nthat several of the Native Americans involved in the project walked off the set didn\u2019t\r\nexactly fill me with hope, and Sandler\u2019s comedy track record has been spotty at\r\nbest, somehow getting even lazier as his career has devolved into getting studios\r\nto pay for his vacations (\u201cJust Go with It,\u201d \u201cBlended\u201d). When Netflix decided\r\nto not screen it for TV or film critics before it premiered on their streaming\r\nservice today, it felt like the final straw. Little did I know how bad it would\r\nbe. The combined \u2013isms of a script in which a Native American character is\r\nnamed \u201cBeaver Breath\u201d are overwhelmingly unfunny enough, but it\u2019s really only one aspect\r\nof the monumental failure on display in a film that is almost bafflingly bad.  Advertisement Where do we begin? The recurring joke about a burro with\r\ndiarrhea that can spray across the room? The extended bit in which a man scoops\r\nout his right eye? The character who is supposed to be so dumb that he thinks\r\nwomen poop babies and says \u201ccanty-lopes\u201d\r\nand \u201cpanty-cakes\u201d? The fact that\r\nVanilla Ice plays Mark Twain and actually says, \u201cMake it rain like Twain\u201d as he antes into a poker game? You read that\r\nright\u2014Vanilla Ice plays Mark Twain.\r\nHow about the multiple occasions in which you can see people like Blake Shelton\r\nand Will Forte look around and basically say, \u201cCan you believe we\u2019re getting paid for this?\u201d It\u2019s like someone\r\nmade a bet that they could take money from a major company like Netflix and do\r\nthe absolute bare minimum with it. The best place to start is probably with Adam Sandler\u2019s\r\nhalf-asleep, horrendous performance\u2014the worst of his career\u2014in the lead role of\r\nTommy, aka White Knife, a man raised by the Apaches to have superhuman fighting\r\nskills. Sandler can\u2019t decide if Tommy should be the stoic, leader of this gang\r\nof misfits or the wacky Native American stereotype he likely first conceived him as, and so he makes no choice at all outside of \"sleepy.\" He can\u2019t hide\r\nhis disdain or complete lack of interest in the project. I get that Sandler is\r\nmaking movies pretty much just to keep his friends employed at this point, but\r\nwould it be too much to ask to see an ounce of acting effort?  Tommy\u2019s journey begins when he meets his father, Frank\r\nStockburn (Nick Nolte), just before the old man is kidnapped by a bad guy named\r\nCicero (Danny Trejo). He leaves his tribe to find his dad, discovering along\r\nthe way that Frank was a busy man and Tommy has five half-brothers: Ramon (Rob\r\nSchneider), Lil Pete (Taylor Lautner), Herm (Jorge Garcia), Danny (Luke Wilson)\r\nand Chico (Terry Crews). They form \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d and set out to save their\r\nnewly-discovered patriarch. To say that Sandler and Tim Herlihy\u2019s script is \u201cepisodic\u201d\r\nwould be an understatement. It\u2019s a series of scenes only loosely connected by\r\ncast and location. I\u2019ve seen episodes of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in which the\r\nsketches seemed more of a single piece than parts of this film. One minute,\r\nthey\u2019re learning how to play baseball from John Turturro; another minute they\u2019re\r\nplaying poker with Vanilla Ice, David Spade and Blake Shelton. It\u2019s like\r\nsomeone put ideas for Western-themed sketch comedy on a board and then Sandler\r\nthrew darts at it to determine its order. The film has no flow, no rhythm, and\r\nabsolutely no reason to be 119 minutes. Advertisement And then there\u2019s the broad racism and misogyny of the piece.\r\nAfter the controversial walk-offs, Netflix claimed that this was \u201csatire.\u201d It\u2019s\r\nnot. There\u2019s nothing satirical about Sandler\u2019s bad Native American accent\r\n(which totally comes and goes, by the way) or Schneider\u2019s Hispanic caricature. Saying\r\nthat this is satire is like the drunk guy at the bar telling you how many black\r\nfriends he has after telling a racist joke. Don\u2019t fall for it. There are a pair of good-to-great Westerns coming out in the\r\nnext few weeks in theaters that should satisfy your need for gunslingers and\r\nhorse-riding. Much has been made of the impact that Netflix has had on the television\r\nlandscape. Given the fact that \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d is the first of a\r\nfour-picture deal with the company, they seem to have little interest in making\r\nthe same impact in the world of film.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Mary and the Witch's Flower", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower,\u201d the first film from Studio Ponoc, an animation outfit founded by Studio Ghibli veterans Hiromasa Yonebayashi and Yoshiaki Nishimura after Ghibli closed its doors in 2015, starts in medias res, with a violent firestorm engulfing the screen. A small girl with bright red hair escapes the maelstrom by flying away on a broomstick, pursued by dolphin-squid-fighter-jet hybrids. She plunges down through the clouds and crashes into a field, where her stolen cargo of glowing blue flowers scatters, instantly transforming the landscape (trees burst out of the earth to towering heights in the blink of an eye). Who she is, where she is, and why she needs to escape isn\u2019t revealed until nearly the end of the film.\u00a0 Advertisement After the action-packed prologue, \u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower\u201d segues into another world entirely. In bucolic England, another red-haired little girl, Mary (Ruby Barnhill, in the English dub version), waits out the final days of summer vacation while staying at the home of her great-aunt Charlotte (Lynda Baron). The only other kid around is a boy named Peter (Louis Ashbourne Serkis), whom Mary takes a disliking to for no apparent reason. One day, she follows a black cat\u2014who appears to be beckoning her on, like the white rabbit in\u00a0Alice in Wonderland\u2014into the forest. Deep in the forest, she discovers a twisted tree with a broomstick embedded in its trunk and blue flowers glowing at its roots. Mary picks one of the flowers, and is promptly yanked into the sky by the broomstick, which whisks her\u2014and the cat\u2014to a mysterious colorful city floating in the middle of the clouds. This is Endor College, a school for witches. Headmistress Madame Mumblechook (Kate Winslet) gives the agog Mary a tour of the school and becomes convinced Mary is a prodigy, the likes of which she has never seen. \u201cRed-haired witches have always been supremely superior,\u201d she gushes. Mumblechook brings Mary to see Doctor Dee (Jim Broadbent), a small Lenin look-alike, who scribbles formulae on gigantic blackboards, trying to perfect his hush-hush experiments in transformation. He, too, is impressed by Mary\u2019s promise. All of this unfolds in a pure and almost stately atmosphere of accord and exchanged pleasantries. It\u2019s not until halfway through the film that any conflict arises. Is Endor too good to be true? Well, what do you think?\u00a0 \u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower\u201d tiptoes into some pretty interesting territory about magic, its proper and improper\u2014even immoral, unethical\u2014uses. Eventually, when Mary goes up against Mumblechook and Dee, she won\u2019t rely on magic to get her through but ingenuity and courage. This is not the expected path for a film about magic; it\u2019s saying, essentially, \u201cYou don\u2019t need it. You\u2019ve got everything you need with you already.\u201d I found this aspect of the film tremendously exciting, especially how it plays out in the final third.\u00a0 Advertisement The animators invoke worlds upon worlds in \u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower:\u201d the green woods and mist-filled forests of England rendered in swooning evocative watercolors, and the show-stopping Endor, a psychedelic space from out of a dream or drug trip, packed with strange objects, unexplainable phenomena, students floating by in soap bubbles, fountains morphing into human form, grotesque creatures loping out of the shrubbery and disappearing. Endor is dazzling in an off-putting way (similar to some of the \u201cworlds\u201d presented in \u201cThe Congress,\u201d where animated avatars engulf their originals.) The action sequences are intricate and thrilling.\u00a0 \u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower\u201d is based on\u00a0The Little Broomstick, a 1971 children\u2019s novel by popular British author Mary Stewart (who just died in 2014). It\u2019s not hard to picture J.K. Rowling reading\u00a0The Little Broomstick\u00a0as a child, getting swept away by the story of a regular kid (who\u2019s really not regular at all) attending a boarding school run by witches and warlocks. There\u2019s a lot here reminiscent of other stories, like\u00a0Alice in Wonderland,\u00a0Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter, as well as other films from the Studio Ghibli canon. Yonebayashi\u2019s Oscar-nominated \u201cWhen Marnie Was There,\u201d also adapted from a British YA novel published 50 years ago, features a little girl who discovers an abandoned mansion while staying with her relatives in the English countryside. Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s \u201cKiki\u2019s Delivery Service\u201d comes to mind, too, tracking the adventures of a young witch and her \u201cfamiliar,\u201d a cat named Jiji. \u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower\u201d doesn\u2019t feel derivative, but it lacks the depth of these other explorations.\u00a0 Mary, as a character, is refreshingly unremarkable. She\u2019s a regular kid. She has empathy for animals. She\u2019s got a healthy temper. She takes joy in the simple things. She\u2019s helpful to her great-aunt. She hates her hair. She follows the gardener around asking him questions. She seems like a real child (Barnhill\u2019s performance is excellent). However, there\u2019s nothing\u00a0missing\u00a0for Mary.

{"Title": "Last Flag Flying", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cThe worst thing that could ever happen to anybody has landed on you \u2026 and now you just have to deal with it.\u201d And most of us, if we\u2019re lucky, don\u2019t have to deal with \u201cthe worst thing\u201d alone. Richard Linklater\u2019s moving \u201cLast Flag Flying,\u201d a quasi-sequel to Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cThe Last Detail,\u201d is a film built on the deeply humanist career of its filmmaker, one that is about, at its core, what we\u2019re willing to do for one another on our darkest days. It is about being there for people when they need a shoulder to cry on or a hand to help them get up. And it reflects Linklater\u2019s undeniable belief in humankind. Is there any filmmaker who so clearly loves his characters more than Linklater? Jesse and Celine in the \u201cBefore\u201d films; the kids of \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d and \u201cEverybody Wants Some!!\u201d; everyone in \u201cBoyhood\u201d\u2014Linklater\u2019s affection for the people he presents is palpable, and it\u2019s that graceful humanity that keeps \u201cLast Flag Flying\u201d from descending into melodrama. It dips a few too many times to stand with the filmmaker\u2019s best work, and a few asides into \u201cwacky old person behavior\u201d are regrettable, but this is another solid dramedy from one of our best working filmmakers. Advertisement Larry \u2018Doc\u2019 Shepherd (Steve Carell) has had an absolutely horrific year. His wife recently passed of cancer, and he just received news that his son, Larry Jr., died in combat in Iraq\u2014the film takes place in late 2003 (we see Saddam Hussein\u2019s capture on TV screens). The news that Larry has to accompany his son\u2019s body to Arlington has rattled him and he needs some people by his side to whom he hasn\u2019t spoken in decades, his two Vietnam buddies, Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and the Reverend Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne). Cranston is doing a loose riff on what Nicholson did in the original Ashby film, playing the rebellious, hard-drinking, tough-talking member of the trio; Fishburne is the now-religious man who hasn\u2019t lost the passion of his youth, he\u2019s merely channeled it into something else; Carell sometimes looks like a shell of a man, giving the most subdued performance, and one of the best, of his career. What follows is basically an actor\u2019s showcase in the form of a road movie.    And it\u2019s one heck of a showcase. Linklater has received ample credit throughout his career as one of our best writers, but his work with performers still feels underrated. Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, Jack Black, Julie Delpy\u2014Linklater has directed them to performances that would be on any highlight reel of their entire careers. And he does phenomenal work here as an actor\u2019s director, allowing Carell, Fishburne, Cranston, and relative newcomer J. Quinton Johnson (as a soldier who has to accompany the men) to do fantastic, character-driven work. There\u2019s great joy in watching actors this talented being given the space to develop their characters in such a way that the performer fades away and we only see the character. There\u2019s a scene near the end in which the quartet is conversing on a train in which I realized how well-rounded and developed all four performers were in that moment.    Sadly, Linklater and co-writer Darryl Ponicsan (who also wrote the book and \"The Last Detail\") don\u2019t always trust the truth of their situation, ladling on sitcom-ish asides that really grate, although none go on long enough to completely sink the film. The old guys getting confused for terrorists; going on an excursion to buy something mysterious called a cell phone; breaking down Eminem\u2019s \u201cWithout Me,\u201d which Sal is stunned to learn is sung by a white guy\u2014these are all regrettable diversions from the truth of the film because they all feel so completely like a writer\u2019s contrivances.    Advertisement \u201cLast Flag Flying\u201d is far more interesting when it gets philosophical. There\u2019s an interesting undercurrent of faith at play in this story\u2014faith in a higher power that leads one into life as a Reverend or faith in a system that orders young men to die in impossible wars, and ultimately a faith in each other to do the right thing. I wish it was even more daring in terms of how this theme is explored, but it\u2019s definitely there. I also wanted more examination of the individual vs. the institution, most reflected in the decision over whether or not to bury Larry in his uniform. Does the uniform represent the man who gave his life or the system that took it? And what about the flag? Again, I feel like there\u2019s a slightly more daring, thematically strident version of \u201cLast Flag Flying\u201d that could have elevated this movie from good to great if it were willing to be just a few degrees more challenging.    Linklater doesn\u2019t help the opinion some will have that this is a bit too manipulative with a score that hits the tinkly piano chords whenever emotion comes into the narrative, but I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit to being moved on more than one occasion. Death comes into all of our lives. If we\u2019re lucky, it doesn\u2019t come into our lives when it comes to our own children. We\u2019re not all so lucky. People very important to me are dealing with the injustice of death as I write this, and \u201cLast Flag Flying\u201d reminded me how essential it is to just be there for them in whatever capacity I\u00a0can. One of the last lines of the film is \u201cDoc needs us.\u201d Linklater is reminding people to be present when they\u2019re needed. Be aware. Be caring. Be truthful. Be alive. More than anything, just be human.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Game Over, Man!", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The stoner comedy style refined by Anders Holm, Blake Anderson and Adam DeVine on the Comedy Central hit \u201cWorkaholics\u201d for seven seasons has moved to Netflix and gotten even raunchier, crazier, and more defiantly reckless. \u201cWorkaholics\u201d meets \u201cDie Hard\u201d in the comedy \u201cGame Over, Man!,\u201d an admirably stupid affair that amply displays the abilities of its\u00a0comedic collaborators in a way that elevates it above many other Netflix original comedies but a movie that probably works better if you\u2019re seriously drunk or high. It\u2019s often clunky and often offensive, but there are moments that remind one how often \u201cWorkaholics\u201d was pretty damn funny in the way it captured a certain kind of man-child who can\u2019t leave the drunk/high/horny culture of college life behind even when they graduate to a cubicle. It will work best for those lamenting the cancellation of the Comedy Central hit that spawned it, but probably not much for anyone else. Advertisement \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d stars Holm, DeVine, and Anderson as three relatively interchangeable bros who work housekeeping at a fancy hotel. In their spare time, they work on a tech project called Skintendo, which is sort of a virtual reality thing, but they really use most of their time to get high and act like idiots (sort of like they did on \u201cWorkaholics\u201d). Leaning into the personalities developed on that show, Holm is the de facto leader of the group, mostly due to his ego, and Anderson is the sweeter, smarter member of the trio. DeVine is the borderline lunatic once again, giving the actor the chance to show off his physical comedy chops, and his willingness to do absolutely anything to get a laugh.    The action of the comedy takes place on the night of a major party at the rooftop bar of the hotel, hosted by the insanely popular and insanely wealthy Bey Awadi (Utkarsh Ambudkar). Just as the guys are mustering up the courage to present Bey with their tech startup idea \u201cShark Tank\u201d-style, a group of high-powered assassins (led by Neal McDonough and Rhona Mitra) take over the party. They\u2019re going to hold Bey and his party goers hostage, including a hotel employee played by Aya Cash of \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst,\u201d until they get millions of dollars transferred to their account. Our heroes stumble into a plan to stop them and save the hostages.    To say that \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d thrives on extreme comedy would be an understatement. Imagine the envelope-pushing humor of \u201cWorkaholics\u201d with no concern about offending advertisers. A few of the more extreme sequences in \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d feature autoerotic asphyxiation, attempts to torture Bey by making him toss another man\u2019s salad, and a severed penis used as a prop. It\u2019s the kind of thing that could send a conservative viewer to the hospital with cardiac arrest. I am far from a traditionally conservative viewer when it comes to comedy, but even I rolled my eyes at the ridiculousness of this whole enterprise a few times. On the one hand, there\u2019s something admirable about being willing to do anything for a joke. On the other, extremity isn\u2019t funny on its own unless you\u2019re really high.    Advertisement More problematic is how often \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d sabotages its best bits. There\u2019s a funny, extreme beat in which DeVine\u2019s character chooses to \u201chide\u201d by pretending to have choked himself to death with his dick in his hand in a closet. But then that bit is followed up by some pretty extreme homophobia. The \u201cWorkaholics\u201d brand of humor often pushes a joke past its breaking point\u2014where it goes from funny to annoying. And that happens more than once in \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d The best bits are often the quickest ones, including a scene with Shaggy that is undeniably funny, and the times when the comedians are just riffing off each other. And the movie gets markedly funnier as the pace picks up because of the plot. Early scenes that go on way too long\u2014there\u2019s a used condom bit that will likely have many viewers lunging for the SmartTV remote\u2014are supplanted by a quicker pace.\u00a0 \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d is grotesque, violent, insane\u00a0and offensive\u2014in other words, it\u2019s kind of exactly what you\u2019d expect from a \u201cWorkaholics\u201d movie unrestricted by basic cable censors. If you\u2019ve never seen the show, you might want to dip your toe in the water with it before jumping into this deep end. If you\u2019re already familiar, suit up and dive in.

{"Title": "The Internship", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In one of the early scenes in \"The Internship,\" heroes Billy and Nick (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson) have a video-conference interview with two recruiters from Google at a computer in a public library. Billy and Nick are two forty-something wristwatch salesmen who lost their jobs when their company folded (nobody uses watches anymore). Both men are now adrift in a world that has passed them by. After a long night of sadly Googling the \"jobs for people with no skills\", Vaughn's Billy stumbles upon Google's competitive internship program and signs up himself and his buddy Nick for an interview. Batting away the children who want to get on the public computer, Billy and Nick shout at top-volume into the screen, despite the fact that they are told by the recruiters, \"Guys, we can hear you\". Billy and Nick jam their heads close together like an old vaudeville team posing for a manic promotional photograph and jabber right into the camera, exuding not only obvious technical incompetence but blatantly embarrassing need.  Advertisement Both men seem to be on the verge of mental collapse. They're Willy Lomans on speed. It's excruciating to watch. And hilarious. Directed by Shawn Levy and\u00a0written by Vince Vaughn and Jared Stern, \"The Internship\" stuffs some creaky gear-shifts and boring exposition in its first 15 minutes; even Will Ferrell's one scene falls a little flat. But the Google interview is the moment the film explodes. The energy is uproarious.\u00a0 Billy and Nick (miraculously, after that debacle of an interview), are chosen to join the Internship summer program at the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. They will compete with other \"Nooglers\" (that's what they're called, don't blame me!) for the coveted positions offered to only a couple of interns at the end of the summer. Billy and Nick, of course, are the oldest people in any room at Google. The college kids assigned to their team immediately treat them with scorn and disrespect, with good reason: Billy, in trying to describe an idea he has for an App (an idea that already exists, of course), keeps saying that after you take the picture with your phone, you put it \"on the line\".  The internship program is run by a Mr. Chetty, played wonderfully by Aasif Mandvi as a Google version of Lou Gossett, Jr.'s drill sergeant in \"An Officer and a Gentleman.\" Mr. Chetty is cold, frightening, and unapproachable. The other members of Billy and Nick's team are played by Tiya Sircar, Dylan O'Brien, Tobit Raphael, and Josh Brener. The script delineates every character smartly, following them on similar journeys of transformation over the course of the summer. Tobit Raphael is Yo Yo, a kid so pressured by his mother to be the best that he picks at his eyebrows (by the end of the film he only has one eyebrow). Tiya Sircar plays a bubbly young woman who talks a big game about her sexy \"cosplay\", only to reveal in a later scene that she's never had a boyfriend, and all her experiences are figments of her imagination. Dylan O'Brien's Stewart is a serious young man who can barely drag his eyes up from his phone; he displays the practical cynicism of a generation that knows that graduating from college is not a guarantee of anything.\u00a0 The team does not bond immediately, and nobody wants Billy or Nick slowing them down. It's tense. But during a ferocious Quidditch match with a rival team, filmed with the intensity of a World Cup final, Billy gives an inspirational speech to his team about a \"little welder girl\" who wanted to go to dance school and never gave up. It's extremely stupid and extremely enjoyable, and the team bonds and comes from behind to almost win the match. They start to work together. Billy and Nick play catch-up in terms of technology, and, of course, the old geezers have a couple of life lessons to teach the young whippersnappers, too. Everybody wins. Advertisement The movie depicts Google culture as if it were a benevolent version of life in a cult compound, with everyone wearing colored beanies and \"Noogle\" T-shirts, riding colorful Google bikes around the campus, and taking the Google shuttle bus into town. The interns compete in different challenges: coding, answering helpline calls, locating bugs. It's hard to believe that a scene about answering a Google helpline could be a gripping cliffhanger, but Levy and his cast pull it off.  There are a couple of problems with the material, none of which ended up mattering much to me. One is the glorification of Google as both a successful company and a mystical entity that makes the world a better place. This sentiment is treated without irony. The food is free at the commissary! There are \"nap pods\" where you can rest! There's a gigantic slide between floors! It's the best place ever! Another potential hitch is that Billy and Nick are angling for an anonymous entry-level job at a gigantic corporation that's hardly the Emerald City that everyone seems to think it is. How long would these two last in homogenized corporate culture, anyway? Do they really want to become a Noogler, filled with \"Googleyness\"? Their enthusiasm doesn't quite track. The flip side of these caveats, though, leads us to the underbelly of the film, its real guts. Google is just the excuse to tell a story about the challenges of growing older, the importance of taking risks, and what it means to be a man in a changing world (shades of Willy Loman again). On that level, the film is solid and quite effective. The moments of sentiment, when they come, feel fully earned, and they come out of characterization.\u00a0 In time you start to care about Yo Yo's emotional life, for example, and when he busts loose in one scene, it's quite satisfying. Owen Wilson's character has never had a relationship that lasts longer than a couple of months, and during his time at Google he begins a flirtation with a serious woman who is always on her way to a meeting (played by the fantastic Rose Byrne). She's a tough nut to crack, and there's a beautiful quiet scene in which she suddenly reveals some of her life regrets to Nick. The director handles the film's tonal dips and swerves confidently. He allows \"The Internship\" to slow down on occasion, and gives both the story and its characters room to breathe. The ending pumps up the suspense in an artificial way, but by that point the real work has already been done. It's not about winning the competition. It never was.\u00a0Billy and Nick are baffled by much of what they encounter at Google, and both have their challenges. They're only in their forties but they're already being treated as old and irrelevant; it's a new experience, one they are not yet used to.\u00a0 Both actors play that anxiety beautifully. You can see disappointment and fear flickering in Vince Vaughn's eyes: he is someone who is used to breezing through on his charm, but the charm is no longer working. He can't just grin at people anymore in a cute conspiratorial way and get away with murder. Everyone sees through him now. And Owen Wilson's Nick is a bit of a follower. As long as he had Billy by his side, he didn't have to make his own choices. Now it's time to step up and be an adult. Besides, some of the things they bring to the table at Google are relevant and necessary. At one point, Wilson gives Vaughn a pep talk, saying, \"You're tough! You grew up in the '70s! You didn't wear a bike helmet. You're tough!\"  Advertisement It's no surprise that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have such entertaining chemistry onscreen. We saw it before in \"The Wedding Crashers\", the gigantic sleeper hit of 2005. What is a surprise is that it has taken them this long to appear together again. In the studio system days, they would have been set to work cranking out comedies as an established duo, beloved by a vast audience. But in today's more individualistic, independent industry, it's taken Wilson and Vaughn nine years to get together again. It's good to see them.", "Critic": "Alpha"}

The first film had its issues, for\r\nsure, but at least it conveyed a DIY, nostalgic throwback to \u201880s horror that\r\ncould excuse some of its deeper flaws. And the second film had two segments\r\nthat I would call must-see, at least for horror fans. It was more polished than\r\nthe first movie (which many purists saw as a flaw), and conveyed where this\r\nseries could go with some talent and some effort. There was little reason to\r\nexpect such a horrendous drop in quality as there is to \u201cViral,\u201d a film that\r\ncontains some of the sloppiest, most ineffective filmmaking I\u2019ve seen all year.  Advertisement Even the wraparound segment doesn\u2019t make any sense. The\r\nfirst two films hinged on old VHS tapes discovered\r\nand then \u201cplayed\u201d for the audience: short films connected\r\nby a wraparound segment. The connective tissue this time is an obnoxious piece\r\nthat seems designed to play off the titular concept of virality in today\u2019s\r\nsocial media world but is just loud, poorly edited and remarkably annoying. You\r\nhave to dig to discern that \u201cV/H/S: Viral\u201d consists of short films with enough\r\nviral content to actually be deadly. Imagine someone screaming at you between\r\nshort films and you have some idea what\u2019s going on here.  Now, the idea that these are viral short films does give the\r\nfilmmakers a bit more freedom in terms of the general restrictions of the found\r\nfootage genre. However, that still\r\ndidn\u2019t excuse half of the \u201cwhy would someone be filming that\u201d choices that\r\nfollow. To say that \u201cV/H/S: Viral\u201d pushes the suspension of disbelief in terms\r\nof found footage would be an understatement. The \u201cZombie Go-Pro\u201d segment in \u201cV/H/S/2\u201d\r\nwas delightfully simple\u2014what if someone had a camera on their head during the\r\nundead apocalypse? All of the filmmakers here would have been well-advised to\r\nfollow that simple-is-better structure. The problems start with the first convoluted mess, \u201cDante\r\nthe Great,\u201d a piece about a magician (Justin Wellborn) who finds a magical cape\r\nand goes power mad with it. Everything about this segment fails. The acting is\r\nunconvincing, the structure is never consistent (are they making a documentary\r\nor is this hidden camera footage?), and the storytelling is unengaging. There\u2019s\r\nnot a single clever, interesting or memorable moment in it. The scariest thing\r\nabout it is that someone thought it was competent enough to be included in a\r\nmajor film. It needed rewrites, recasting, and another round of editing. And it\r\nprobably still wouldn\u2019t have worked. Advertisement The bafflingly low bar set by \u201cDante the Great\u201d makes Nacho\r\nVigalondo\u2019s \u201cParallel Monsters\u201d feel like an oasis in a horror desert. In it, a\r\nmad scientist in his basement opens a door to a parallel reality, where he sees\r\nan identical version of himself. The pair agrees to hop universes for 15\r\nminutes, look around, and come back. He QUICKLY learns that the external\r\nappearance of his doppelganger is the only thing that\u2019s the same on the other\r\nside of that door. This bit has a nice energy and the confidence brought to it\r\nby Vigalondo, but even it ends on a note of disappointment. In comparison to\r\nthe rest of the film, it\u2019s a masterpiece, but even it just misses what I think\r\nVigalondo intended by virtue of being largely one-joke. It\u2019s a good joke, but\r\nit\u2019s still just one joke. And then it\u2019s back into the pit with \u201cBonestorm,\u201d an aggressively\r\nloud and annoying piece about skateboarders who stumble on a cult looking for a\r\nsacrifice. There are only so many shots of skateboard kids slicing and dicing\r\ntheir enemies one can take before we\u2019ve crossed the line from film to something\r\nthat looks more like a video game. I take that back. Most video games are more\r\ncompetently made. Like a lot of horror fans, I'm both more forgiving and more critical of the genre. I know, from experience, that those who love horror movies will often overlook flaws simply because they so badly want their genre to become more respectable and critically acclaimed. Horror fans seek out under-the-radar gems, and embrace their genre's most creative voices. However, it also feels like that blind love for the horror genre can be abused by lazy filmmaking. I get angry when it feels like a fan base is being exploited because, well, \"they'll see it anyway because they liked the last one.\" We've seen this in countless bad horror sequels. And it's exactly what we're seeing here with \"V/H/S: Viral.\"", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Annabelle: Creation", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "It used to be a pretty reliable rule of moviedom that sequels to inferior horror films were even more worthless than the original. After all, how do you build on nothing? Last year\u2019s \u201cOuija: Origin of Evil\u201d was widely and correctly considered superior to the dull original, and 2017 repeats that shocking trick with \u201cAnnabelle: Creation,\u201d a vast improvement over the monstrously awful \u201cAnnabelle\u201d from 2014. Whereas that film felt like a quickie way to cash-in on the success of \u201cThe Conjuring,\u201d David F. Sandberg\u2019s follow-up doesn\u2019t feel focus-grouped to death or spawned purely for profit margins. It has echoes of the original film, and works more with mood and less with cheap scares than either \u201cAnnabelle\u201d or \u201cThe Conjuring 2,\u201d resulting in a truly effective genre flick. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s damn closer than anyone would have predicted. Advertisement While the title makes clear that this is an origin story for one of the creepiest dolls in film history, it also sets up its own characters and universe in which to play, one that echoes the construction and themes from James Wan\u2019s original film more than any of the works that have followed. Just as that box office hit centered on a group of sisters caught in a nightmare, \u201cAnnabelle: Creation\u201d is essentially a haunted house flick with another collection of young girls faced with things that go bump in the night. In this case, it\u2019s a group of orphans who are allowed to live in a large, isolated home when their orphanage closes. Led by Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), the girls vary in age\u2014again, like the sisters in the original film\u2014but focus immediately falls on Janice (Taliha Bateman), weakened by polio, and her sweet best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson). Any good horror fan knows that evil always preys on the weak and kind first. And so it\u2019s Janice who first notices something isn\u2019t right in the Mullins house. Sure, Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) seems like a nice enough guy, but he\u2019s overly concerned about anyone going in his deceased daughter Bee\u2019s room. And Esther Mullins (Miranda Otto) is even more mysterious, injured, bed-ridden and ringing a bell whenever she needs her husband. The girls mostly stay to themselves, but Janice is the first to notice that Bee\u2019s locked room is open in the middle of the night, and then she finds that damned doll. Before you know it, souls are being fought over, lights are going out, and religious imagery is being subverted everywhere. These movies have several themes, but one of the most prominent is the utter failure of religion to protect us from true evil. Sandberg loves to cast light through crosses on windows and gets some incredible mileage in the final act with imagery that recalls the crucifixion. Yes, believe it or not, \u201cAnnabelle: Creation\u201d has what the first film was so clearly lacking: a strong visual language. Sandberg and his team do a marvelous job at building tension through old-fashioned horror movie means like forcing our perspective to stay with our terrified young ladies. As their eyes widen and the hair on their neck goes up regarding just what is making that creaking sound down the dark hallway, so does yours. Sandberg knows that fear manifests most greatly from the unknown and he has a ball playing with sound and light in \u201cCreation.\u201d Creaking chairs, footsteps when everyone should be asleep, that damn bell Mrs. Mullins rings\u2014all get used masterfully in the first half of the film.\u00a0 Advertisement Of course, we know all of these tricks. And Sandberg knows we know. Rarely have I seen a mainstream horror movie that riffs more playfully with the awareness of the modern horror audience. Sandberg knows that if he shows you an open door into a darkened room, your eyes are going to be planted on that darkness, searching the edges of the frame for movement, glowing eyes, whatever. If he puts Annabelle in the background, no one\u00a0is paying attention to the foreground. He has a blast with these constructions during the set-up parts of \"Annabelle: Creation.\" And then Sandberg and his team unleash the fury in the final half-hour of the film, constructing some of the best mainstream horror sequences of the last few years, including one in a barn that had the poor large gentleman next to me just whispering \u201cno, no, no.\u201d That\u2019s when you know a movie is really working. When it reduces grown men to single syllables. \u201cAnnabelle: Creation\u201d isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s a bit too long (109 minutes) and sometimes feels like it\u2019s making up its own story logic as it goes along. In that sense, it\u2019s more like a ghost story told around a campfire than a literal origin story\u2014a blend of religious imagery, grieving parents, weakened children, and otherworldly evil\u2014and that urban legend aspect could have allowed Sandberg and writer Gary Dauberman to lean into the insanity of their concept a bit more. The aforementioned barn sequence being a great example of when the movie knows to go crazy, but the movie often feels like it\u2019s pulling back from true risk-taking. It sometimes seems too restrained, believe it or not given it\u2019s about a possessed doll, and a few too many of the scariest scenes end ineffectively with jump scares that don\u2019t pay off like the great build-ups. But, again, it\u2019s more about what could be making that creaking sound in the hallway than the heavily made-up demon that\u2019s actually there.

{"Title": "Kiki", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In 1990, Madonna brought \"Voguing\"\u2014an exaggerated dance style started in the underground ballroom scene in Harlem\u2014to the mainstream with her mega-hit \"Vogue,\" a song that celebrates fantasy and escapism and beauty. Madonna hired dancers she had seen out in the New York club scene, and suddenly, that secret underground world of drag clubs and \"Harlem ballroom\" was on display at the MTV Awards and in the David Fincher-directed video of the song. That same year, \"Paris is Burning,\" Jennie Livingston's documentary about the Harlem dance club and drag scene, won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance. If anyone wondered where Madonna heard about \"voguing,\" the documentary was the answer. Now, 26 years later, comes Sara Jorden\u00f6\u2019s \"Kiki,\" another deep dive into the same scene. It's an intimate look at a marginalized community, many of whom rely on the various neighborhood clubs for support systems that don't exist anywhere else. The so-called \"Kiki\" scene is not just about the various competitive dance club contests. The scene provides a social structure, a \"net,\" for kids who have nowhere else to go. Advertisement Jorden\u00f6, a Swedish filmmaker, collaborated on the film with LGBTQ activist Twiggy Pucci Garcon (he gets a co-writing credit). Twiggy is a highly visible member of the ballroom scene, and his involvement was crucial in terms of providing Jorden\u00f6 access to a community that is highly protective (with good reason) of its members. The documentary has a high-energy and full-immersion style that thrusts you into the center of the various \"houses\" connected to the scene. Each \"house\" has a team that competes in the dance competitions. The dance competitors are mostly queer and trans people of color, and \"Kiki\" introduces you to many of them. \"Kiki,\" with all of its group scenes (kids Voguing on the Chelsea piersa common hangout, the raucous competitions themselves), is really a character-driven narrative. While there are similarities in many of their stories, each journey is different. Many of the young adults profiled have been kicked out of the house for being trans, queer, or just gender-nonconforming. They have gravitated towards one another, and immersed themselves in a culture that is nonjudgmental, open, and caring. They take care of each other. They crash on each other's couches. They have each other's collective backs. \"Paris is Burning\" highlighted the struggles of queer kids in the Reagan/Bush era, and \"Kiki\" shows the anxiety of the scene at the tail-end of the Obama years. Many of these people depend on federal funding. They are among the most vulnerable members of our society. They already experience an onslaught of harassment from family, peers, police. Many of them have fallen into addiction or sex work. There are support groups sponsored by each house, where people can talk openly about these issues. Twiggy is one of our main ways \"in\" to this closed scene, and you see him running warm-ups for rehearsals, and keeping everyone in line, reminding them of the stakes in the competitions. He is an activist, working for the homeless LGBT youths in his community, helping to provide structures of support and relief. Gia Marie Love emerges as the star of the film, however: a trans woman who has transformed herself from a bullied youth into a leader in her community. Watching her run a support group, it's not hard to understand why she was a debate club champion in high school. There's the soft-spoken Divo, kicked out of the house by his mother, who was\u2014as he admits freely\u2014saved by the ballroom scene. Advertisement One thing \"Kiki\" does really well is show how these dance competitions are an organizational structure for kids who might otherwise slip through the cracks. Everyone makes their own costumes, which are fantastical and outrageous. Taking place in school gyms and community halls, it's a safe space where people can let loose and express themselves, with no fear of harassment or rejection. This is a scene that takes care of its own. In many cases, it's literally life or death. Jorden\u00f6 makes a couple of directorial choices that repeat throughout: each person is seen standing on a city sidewalk, a pier, a street corner, staring directly at the camera, a vision of stillness that stops the film in its tracks, giving us a chance to breathe, to look. There are also a couple of scenes shot in an empty theatre, where the various dancers, bathed in blue light, show their stuff. It provides another perspective of these street kids, their ability to translate their fantasies of themselves into movement, elegant and elongated and exaggerated. The full-immersion style has its drawbacks. The characters are introduced early on, those the film will follow, but biographical details and \"confessional\" comments come late in the documentary. It takes a while to understand what is happening, and who is who. The jostle of names and information and intersecting relationships is a confusing bombardment.\u00a0 With music by Qween Beat, \"Kiki\" shows the new generation of the ballroom scene, their care for one another, their awareness of the struggles ahead, their determination to be themselves, against all odds. They are scared, but they are strong. They know what is right and they fight for it. \"Kiki,\" with all its rough glamour and rambunctious dancing, is a political film. These kids live it.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Stratton", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "This movie opens with a bunch of texts extolling the badassery of the \u201cSpecial Boat Service,\u201d a branch of Britain\u2019s Royal Navy. The text has a certain needling quality; were it to have wound up saying \u201cTrust us, it\u2019s really badass,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be a bit surprised. We see the problem here. Unlike \u201cNavy SEALS,\u201d which has an intriguing ring to it right off the bat, \u201cSpecial Boat Service\u201d sounds like something you\u2019d call if you need a particularly swanky water taxi. \u201cStratton,\u201d then, is titled for a particularly badass member of Special Boat Service. It is based on a book by Duncan Falconer, which yes, is a pen name,\u00a0apparently, for a person who was once in the Special Boat Service and has written one non-fiction book about it and a bunch of Stratton novels about it. This movie is directed by Simon West, who as many people are fond of recalling, also directed \u201cCon Air,\u201d the 1997 action thriller that has accrued something resembling classic status over the past two decades. Apparently \u201cCon Air\u201d is enough to get some people\u2019s hopes up every time a new film directed by Simon West comes around. This wannabe franchise opener does not fulfill any hope, however. Advertisement After explaining Special Boat Service, the movie chronicles Dominic Cooper\u2019s Stratton on a mission in the Persian Gulf, particularly Iran\u2019s Strait of Hormuz. The bearded operative is joined by American partner Marty, stealthily raiding a chemical weapons plant while their remote support team keeps track of them. I don\u2019t watch the television series \u201cScorpion\u201d regularly, honest I don\u2019t, but this opener feels like an episode of that show with the \u201cwacky\u201d characters excised. That is, a tense woman in front of a computer (Gemma Chan) instructs Stratton and Marty as the \u201ctension\u201d mounts and the inevitable cry of \u201cWe have no choice! Just send in the chopper!\u201d is sounded.    Back home on his lonesome, Stratton licks his wounds on his houseboat, from which his now ex-girlfriend has disembarked. No worries: he has an eccentric hard-drinking neighbor (Derek Jacobi) on a neighboring boat. I think these guys are standard issue for British intelligence agents. Back at the office, Stratton reports to female boss Sumner, whose authority is immediately undercut for the viewer on account of her being portrayed on an elliptical exercise machine when Stratton walks in. There\u2019s all sorts of bad news. The guy who led an armed attack on Stratton and the now-absent Marty is a long-thought-dead Russian operative with whom Sumner (poor Connie Nielsen) was once romantically involved. Also, there\u2019s a mole in the SBS offices, whose identity you\u2019ll guess as soon as the actor who plays him walks into a frame. And there\u2019s a terrorist attack in the offing. Target: they don\u2019t know yet. Oh, wait, a little while later they find out. Oh, no. It\u2019s London.    This really is a paint-by-numbers action movie with two good things going for it. Those are brevity\u2014it\u2019s only 93 minutes long\u2014and immediate forgetability. This latter quality, I allow, is only considered good by a certain class of people, those who feel overly beleaguered. Given that this is a movie reaching our screens in a time when people are just plain tired, and perhaps dreading the travails of the year ahead, an aggressively unimposing movie such as this might not be the worst time-waster. But it\u2019s still a time-waster.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "It's So Easy and Other Lies", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\u201cIt\u2019s So Easy and Other Lies\u201d is a TV special (or DVD extra) about Duff McKagan\u2019s live reading of his book of the same name, as accompanied by a band. It\u2019s not revealing or dense enough to really qualify as a feature doc, as evidenced by its remarkably brief running time and superficial retelling of complex chapters from McKagan\u2019s life. To call it a greatest hits version of the book wouldn\u2019t even really be accurate as the film can\u2019t stay focused on any chapter or anecdote long enough for them to resonate. And the movie has an undeniable black hole at its center in the fact that it barely mentions Axl Rose, and includes no original Guns N' Roses recordings (although the band does play instrumental versions of songs like \"Paradise City\" and \"Nighttrain\"). McKagan reads passages from his book and performs songs in front of an audience, and that serves as the foundation of \u201cIt\u2019s So Easy and Other Lies.\u201d I would have much rather just watched a concert film of that event than the documentary that Christopher Duddy tries to shape from it. Advertisement Of course, \u201cIt\u2019s So Easy and Other Lies\u201d opens with the word \u201cfuck\u201d and some guitar riffs. It kind of legally has to, right? As the personable and incredibly talented McKagan reads chapters from his book, Duddy intercuts them with old photos, footage of Duff riding around L.A., interviews and even animation. It\u2019s a cluttered approach that feels desperate to please and almost manic. For the next seventy minutes or so, this style rarely changes, as the film flits from subject to subject. We learn about when Duff met Slash. We hear about McKagan\u2019s early bands (some with names like Thankless Dogs, Cleavage and The Fartz). We get a bit about how Seattle drug culture was killing some of the biggest names in music. Although any music fan who sees \u201cAndrew Wood RIP\u201d followed by \u201cLayne Staley RIP\u201d and then hears the line from McKagan\u2019s book \u201cand the grunge thing didn\u2019t happen until like ten years later\u201d will know how haphazardly the film has been edited together (Wood died in \u201990, Staley in \u201902, grunge \u201chappened\u201d in between). It may sound like nitpicking but it\u2019s an example of how unfocused the movie can feel. There are also elements of McKagan\u2019s writing that are easily forgivable as we speed through the book but less so when read aloud. Lines like \u201cThe whole world is vibrating with anger from within \u2026 and, more ominously, from without\u201d don\u2019t do the production any favors. Most frustratingly, Duddy and McKagan SPEED through the Guns N' Roses years, probably because they knew its degree of difficulty without the actual music. About Axl Rose, we hear McKagan say \u201cI liked him right away,\u201d and then praise his voice, and that\u2019s about it. McKagan talks about hearing Axl scream for the first time, and we don\u2019t hear it. It made me want to pause the movie and go listen to Appetite for Destruction again (and I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t do that). The long history of the drama of GNR is well-recorded, but you can\u2019t really tell McKagan\u2019s story and treat it like a footnote. When someone says late in the film, \u201cWe could talk about McKagan a lot and not talk about Guns N' Roses,\u201d he\u2019s not quite right. And when the film focuses more on Velvet Revolver than GNR, it\u2019s impossible not to feel like the balance is off. 41 minutes into the film, McKagan starts actually singing\u2014\u201cKnockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door,\u201d one of two songs GNR recorded that they were allowed to use, and the other is also a cover, proving that original lyrics were clearly a no-no\u2014during a particularly rough flashback about when his pancreas exploded during a time when he was so deep in his addiction that he barely noticed at first. I would have watched a lot more of that. I imagine the live show, interspersing the readings and live music, is more powerful by having both. By reducing it to just a few lines from the book and editing in everything else, all of it is diminished: the music, the book, the true story. And when the movie essentially ends 30 minutes later (it\u2019s filled out to a more reasonable film running time with an actual musical performance\u2014\u201cYou Can\u2019t Put Your Arms Around a Memory,\u201d a New York Dolls cover that GNR did on \u201cThe Spaghetti Incident\u201d), we\u2019re left wondering what we\u2019ve learned. Duff McKagan is talented, smart and nice. He went through some deep shit with his addictions and came out stronger and happier, with a beautiful family. And he was in one of the best bands of all time. His story deserves a better movie. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Neither Heaven Nor Earth", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Cl\u00e9ment Cogitore\u2019s strong \u201cNeither Heaven Nor Earth\u201d reminds\r\none of \u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d and \u201cAbout Elly\u201d in how those films use disappearance\r\nas a thematic tool more than an unsolved mystery demanding resolution.\r\nCogitore defines his setting well, focusing on the wind, sun and sand of\r\nAfghanistan 2014 as a French group of soldiers keep the fragile peace and\r\nplan for departure. It\u2019s a world that seems mostly harmless, but an early\r\nshoot-out with Taliban in the hills makes it clear that the potential for danger remains. It\u2019s\r\nin this unique setting, a place that inherently feels like purgatory for those\r\nstuck there, that Cogitore crafts a tense tale of faith and mystery.  Advertisement After an encounter with a man and his sheep who get too\r\nclose to their guard post, a pair of French soldiers in Afghanistan, well,\r\ndisappear. One night, they\u2019re watching figures on the horizon. The next\r\nmorning, they are simply gone. Satellite images of the area offer no insight.\r\nThe commander, a confident man named Antar\u00e8s (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier), is naturally\r\nconvinced that they were kidnapped by local opposing forces. Through a\r\ntranslator, he interrogates the denizens of a local village, but his men have\r\nsimply vanished off the face of the Earth. He orders everyone to keep their\r\ndisappearance secret until he can figure out what is going on. Then more men\r\ndisappear. In this rock-strewn middle of nowhere, a man partnered with\r\nanother soldier in a bunker steps outside to urinate. We watch him through the\r\ndoor, knowing that danger\u2014both physical and possibly supernatural\u2014lurks over\r\nthe horizon. Our movie-watching sensibility trains us to fear for his\r\nsafety. We\u2019re in the bunker, he\u2019s out in the dangerous world. He returns to the\r\nbunker and his fellow soldier is gone. This scene really sets the tone for \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d given it\u2019s unbroken nature\u2014we know no one could have come in\r\nand kidnapped this man\u2014and the way Cogitore smartly keeps us in the bunker,\r\nwhere something happens. Exactly what that something is starts to drive Antar\u00e8s\r\ncrazy. As fear starts to overtake the soldiers underneath him, this practical\r\nleader questions what he knows as true\u2014men don\u2019t just disappear. \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d is effective more as a study of fear and failed leadership\r\nthan it is as a horror movie. In fact, if it has a weakness it\u2019s that audiences\r\nexpecting it to build to something tenser or even terrifying will be\r\ndisappointed. It drags a bit around the hour mark when it needs to be building\r\ntension and/or deepening its thematic points. There\u2019s also an underdeveloped\r\nsubplot of sleep deprivation, in that everyone becomes convinced that sleep-time is when people are taken by whatever force is removing them from this barren\r\nlandscape. Terrified and sleep-deprived in a war-torn country? There are times\r\nwhen I wanted those feelings to register more primally and emotionally than\r\nCogitore seems interested in doing. Advertisement Most of the directorial flaws and arguably wasted\r\nopportunity of the final act of \u201cNeither Heaven Nor Earth\u201d are offset by the unshowy,\r\ngrounded way in which Renier grounds the film. A regular collaborator of the\r\nDardennes brothers (\u201cL\u2019Enfant,\u201d \u201cThe Kid with a Bike\u201d), Renier has the natural\r\ncharisma of a born leader that\u2019s fascinating to see undermined by the unique\r\nsituations he finds himself in. While Cogitore generally allows viewers to\r\nplay with the film\u2019s themes to whatever degree they desire (don\u2019t all men\r\ndisappear to some extent during war, for example), Renier has to play the reality\r\nof the situation, and does so admirably. It\u2019s his plight\u2014that of a man\r\ntrained to be rational but now faced with the irrational\u2014that keeps \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d moving.

Its synthetic\r\ntrappings notwithstanding\u2014the \u201cElectronic\u201d part\u2014EDM is dance music, just like\r\nBig Band Swing was, just like early rock and roll was, just like disco was. All\r\nmusics that were initially reviled, and to some extent (with the arguable\r\nexception of Big Band Swing) initially misunderstood by Hollywood.  Advertisement \u201cWe Are Your Friends,\u201d directed by Max Joseph, from a script\r\nby Joseph and Meaghan Oppenheimer (based on a story by producer Richard\r\nSilverman), makes a big deal out of \u201cgetting\u201d EDM. There\u2019s the sleek,\r\nvisual-format flexible manner of the filmmaking, which mixes graphic design\r\ntropes with animation and such for some of the movie\u2019s most engaging sequences.\r\nThere\u2019s a scene in which the protagonist, a fledgling EDM DJ named Cole Carter,\r\nexplains the science of EDM as he rocks a dance floor, elaborating on getting\r\nthe magic BPM (Beats Per Minute) count that makes the music control the dance\r\nfloor subjects, almost zombie-like in the grip of the pulsating bass. There\u2019s a\r\nlittle music-wonk name dropping, with a mentor DJ showing off a rare Buchla\r\nsynthesizer and comparing his possible prot\u00e9g\u00e9, unfavorably, to one Juan\r\nAtkins.  Joseph recently made a documentary about the EDM production\r\nteam/record label DFA, so he\u2019s got some genuine knowledge under his belt. And\r\nwhile EDM is an area of music in which my expertise doesn\u2019t extend far past\r\nthat of an interested dabbler/dilettante, the EDM soundtrack of this movie\r\nsounded pretty credible/hot to me. Too bad that the movie\u2019s character dynamics\r\nand plot are as cheesy as that of, oh, I dunno, \u201cDon\u2019t Knock The Rock.\u201d How\u2019s\r\nthis for clich\u00e9: talented, eager, but unseasoned DJ gets taken under the wing\r\nof older, popular, but jaded and close-to-washed-up genre star, who shows him\r\nthe ropes, opens his ears, and who also happens to\u2026wait for it\u2026have a gorgeous\r\ngirlfriend with whom Mr. Talented And Eager gets entangled in a bad way. Yeah,\r\nthat kind of plot.  What\u2019s worse is that said DJ, Cole Carter, comes complete\r\nwith a contingent of San Fernando Valley tatted BroDouche pals, kind of out of\r\nthe \u201cDiner\u201d handbook but even more belligerent, clueless, and sexist. And minus\r\nany charm. There\u2019s super-brash Mason (Jonny Weston), self-proclaimed \u201cmovie\r\nstar\u201d Ollie (Shiloh Fernandez), and Squirrel (Alex Shaffer). In the event you\r\nhaven\u2019t guessed, Squirrel is the shy, sensitive one.  As for Cole, he\u2019s played by Zac Efron, getting a tad edgier\r\nafter \u201cNeighbors.\u201d I had, a few months ago, come upon a bit of misinformation:\r\nI read somewhere that Zach Braff was playing the role of the EDM DJ in this\r\nmovie. I had a great observation prepared, something along the lines of,\u00a0 \u201cZach Braff trying to pass himself off as a\r\nguy who\u2019s even HEARD any EDM, let alone an EDM DJ, is about as plausible as\r\nBruce Hornsby jamming with The Melvins.\u201d But, as I said, I was misinformed.  Advertisement Efron, however, often looks nearly at sea as Braff would\r\nhave. Part of it has to do with his character being a bit of a cipher to begin\r\nwith. His mentor-girlfriend triangle, while entirely rote and predictable in\r\nmost of its particulars, also constitutes one of the more watchable overall\r\nportions of the movie (the stuff with Cole and his pals is very nearly\r\ninsufferable, and the detour these career-challenged millennials take with a\r\ncoarse real estate vulture in a subplot constitutes several varieties of\r\nnadir), because the mentor DJ is played by Wes Bentley, who brings a humming\r\nundercurrent of sardonicism to his role, and the assistant/girlfriend is played\r\nby Emily Ratajkowski who is just\u2026delightful to look upon. A scene at a Vegas DJ\r\nfest wherein her character gives Cole a tab of Ecstasy, or whatever it is, and\r\nthey \u201croll\u201d together made me wish I was a much younger man, a man with hair,\r\nand a tolerance for recreational drugs. I should say ALMOST made me wish, as I\r\nhappen to be happily married to a beautiful woman who doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m\r\nbald. I should also mention that aside from having Major Presence, Ratajkowski\r\nnavigates her character\u2019s three crucial (actually only) nodes, Sweet, Sexy, and\r\nSensible, very well.  But I digress. Lest the viewer come to the conclusion that\r\nthis movie\u2019s portrayal of the EDM drug culture is too cavalier, there does kick\r\nin near the end a Cautionary Tale Plot Point, which is arbitrary to the point\r\nof insulting.

As is often the case with films that crib from the horror-comedy\r\nmasters like Peter Jackson, the balance is tougher to pull off than it first\r\nappears, and \u201cDeathgasm\u201d gets a bit numbing and repetitive before it\u2019s over,\r\nbut there\u2019s enough fun, clever material here for metalheads and horror fans to\r\nlike until Sean Byrne\u2019s superior \u201cThe Devil Candy\u201d (a TIFF hit that also plays\r\nwith that elusive dynamic between metal and Satan) lands sometime next year. Advertisement Brodie (the natural Milo Cawthorne) has just moved to a\r\nmiserable new town, one in which he clearly doesn\u2019t belong. Staying with his\r\nultra-religious aunt and uncle, Brodie wears his metalhead status like a crown,\r\nrefusing to give into bullies like his cousin or the perceived suburban norm.\r\nAfter a few false starts of friendship with other social misfits who have\r\nsuffered similar bully abuse, Brodie finally thinks he\u2019s found a soulmate in Zakk\r\n(James Blake) another guy who paints his face and rocks out. Brodie also notices\r\nthe prettiest girl at school, the charming Medina (Kimberley Crossman), and\r\nfalls hard, even though she\u2019s dating his jock cousin. After being bullied one\r\ntoo many times and failing to win the heart of the blonde lass, Brodie plays a\r\nsong with his new band, DEATHGASM (all caps, of course), and inadvertently brings\r\nforth a demon force known as The Blind One, instantly plunging their normal\r\ncorner of the world into bloody chaos. Can the rockers survive the end of the\r\nworld? I do mean instantly.\r\nOne of the more admirable elements of \u201cDeathgasm\u201d is how little time Howden\r\nwastes once the demonic viscera hits the fan. This is not a slow burn\u2014it\u2019s an\r\norgy of crazy violence and impressive make-up effects. Before the guys know it,\r\neveryone around them has been possessed by something that looks like what Ash\r\nlocked in the basement in \u201cEvil Dead 2.\u201d The summoning song is played and\r\nsuddenly people are puking blood and faces are getting power-sanded. Through it\r\nall, Howden keeps an admirable, Jackson-esque levity in the film that works\r\nmore often than it falters. Dialogue like, \u201cIt\u2019s\r\nweird, but I think he would have wanted to go out like this,\u201d after a\r\nparticularly brutal death keep things from getting overly gross and repulsively gory for a while\r\n(I also particularly enjoyed a bad guy ordering someone be decapitated a second\r\ntime to confused looks of his minions). However, gorehounds need not worry that a movie called \u201cDeathgasm\u201d\r\nplays it safe. This is a defiantly, well, metal movie. From a possessed human\r\nbeing bludgeoned with a sex toy to a guy whose head and spine are literally\r\nripped from his body, there are a number of opportunities for the film\u2019s\r\nfanbase to give devil horns to the screen. At its best, it\u2019s like a Megadeth\r\nalbum cover sprung to life. The only problems come, as they often do in films\r\nlike this, in the pacing department. To be honest, it\u2019s another trait shared\r\nwith metal in that a lot of heavy albums get numbing and exhausting around the\r\n2/3rds mark. That\u2019s about when I was ready for \u201cDeathgasm\u201d to finish up its\r\nencore.  Advertisement Howden\u2019s debut is helped greatly by his cast, especially\r\nCawthorne and Crossman, a cute couple who go well beyond \u201cdork\u201d and \u201cpopular\r\ngirl\u201d to ground their characters in ways that horror often misses. The director\r\nand his stars commit to the insanity of their project.

{"Title": "The Scribbler", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "With narrative echoes of \u201cSucker Punch\u201d and stylistic\r\ncommonalities with \u201cSin City,\u201d one would expect John Suits\u2019 \u201cThe Scribbler,\u201d\r\nadapted by graphic novelist Dan Schaffer, to at least be a bit of escapist fun.\r\nA female empowerment, mental illness-defeating, noir-esque comic book movie\r\nwith B-movie Goddesses like Gina Gershon, Sasha Grey and Eliza Dushku? Where do\r\nI buy tickets? And yet \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d never clicks into the escapist mind f**k\r\nit really needed to be to work. It can't maintain its style and never finds its substance. It\u2019s a ridiculous narrative with scenery-chewing\r\nperformances, but it doesn\u2019t have the form to match. It\u2019s dull when one wants\r\nit to be ludicrous, and serves as a reminder of how hard it is to bring comic books to celluloid life on a limited budget. Advertisement Suki (Katie Cassidy) has multiple personalities, one of\r\nwhich is the title character. Her Doctor (Billy Campbell) has developed a\r\ntechnique known as \u201cThe Siamese Burn,\u201d which is essentially a massive shock to\r\nthe system designed to destroy the extraneous personalities one at a time. But\r\nwhich ones are extraneous? And what will she do when she\u2019s down to two?\r\nQuestions like these linger in the background of what is also a poorly-written\r\nmystery. The \u201cBurn\u201d subplot is actually part of a flashback conveyed through an\r\ninvestigation by two police officers (Eliza Dushku, Michael Imperioli) into why\r\nall of Suki\u2019s fellow inhabitants of Juniper Tower happen to be showing up dead.\r\nThe Tower is a halfway house for the \u201cmentally and socially inept,\u201d which\r\nallows for a cavalcade of odd characters, including a bunny ear-wearing Sasha\r\nGrey, milk bath-taking Gina Gershon, disturbing Michelle Trachtenberg,\r\nscene-stealing Garret Dillahunt and a girl who just walks around naked (Ashlynn\r\nYennie). One by one, most of these characters jump from Juniper Tower, leading\r\none to wonder if \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d doesn\u2019t have echoes of \u201cIdentity\u201d as well and\r\nthese people are all just dying personalities of the film\u2019s protagonist. The best moments of \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d embrace the film\u2019s\r\nridiculous concept with overheated dialogue pulled from the noir/action comic\r\nbook manual. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what happened, from the beginning?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s\r\nnot always the best way to tell a story.\u201d Those lines early in Schaffer\u2019s film\r\nsets it up as a work that will navigate the traditional storytelling structure\r\nin a unique manner, but \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d ends up depressingly linear.

{"Title": "Obvious Child", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Writer-director Gillian Robespierre's \"Obvious Child\" arrives with the buzz of Sundance behind it, and the unfortunate buzz of being billed as the first \"abortion comedy.\" Those words are a bit misleading. \"Obvious Child\" is definitely a comedy, and it also deals with abortion. But the approach is not glib or casual. It's a film that is really about the behavior of its main characters, the rhythms of conversations, the unexpected moments that surprise, and the sudden flashes of feeling that act as an ambush. It's a whirlwind. It touches on themes of arrested development, needing to grow up and to accept responsibility for who you are (both onstage and off, the film being about a standup comedian who uses her own life story in her act), but \"Obvious Child\" is not ponderous with these themes. Advertisement \"Obvious Child\" starts in a small stand-up club in Brooklyn, the kind of place with seven or eight tables and a unisex bathroom covered in graffiti. The comics who show up all have bigger dreams, they have agents, they just sold a pilot. The film opens with Donna (Jenny Slate) on-stage, in the midst of doing a set, one that is immediately disarming, honest and legitimately funny. It feels unscripted. It's a bit of a mess. Her delivery is spontaneous, even down to moments where she loses track of what she is saying and has to find her way back to the joke. She gets an enthusiastic response from the audience. But her boyfriend, smoldering in the back, feels differently about being used as a prop in her comedy, and breaks up with her. The breakup scene is when I first sensed that \"Obvious Child\" was working on a unique wavelength. She is truly crushed at the turn of events. Donna is not just a wise-cracking broad, using her comedy to keep people at bay, or joke her way out of living a serious life (although that is part of it). Comedy is not pathologized here, although the impulse to get up and talk about your life in front of others is examined in interesting ways. Donna is vulnerable and that vulnerability is part of her act. The concept of using one's life as fodder for your art is an underlying motif of \"Obvious Child,\" and it comes back again and again, seen through different angles of the prism. Sometimes Donna hits it out of the park. Other times, like when she goes on-stage wasted, in the wake of the breakup, and rambles on incessantly to an increasingly embarrassed audience, she falls flat on her face. Donna is almost thirty, and still babied by her parents (Richard Kind and Polly Draper), she is a clerk in a bookstore called \"Unoppressive Non-Imperialst Books,\" and lives with her roommate Nellie (an excellent Gaby Hoffman). One drunken night at the club, she goes home with a guy named Max (Jake Lacy), who is not a comedian, is in business school, and seems taken with Donna's aggressive brand of conversation (despite the fact that he also has a hard time keeping up with it). They cavort around. They laugh. They have sex. It's all a part of her breakup tailspin. Advertisement When she finds herself pregnant a couple of weeks later, she doesn't know what the hell to do. Max keeps showing up in her life. He seems to want to go on dates now. Should she tell him he got her pregnant? She barely knows him. Unlike in Judd Apatow's \"Knocked Up,\" with a similar circumstance and where abortion is not even mentioned by name (except for the cowardly \"schma-shmortion\"), \"Obvious Child\" is honest. There are moments of gallows humor. There are moments of deep pain and struggle. There's one great scene when Donna is in the back of a cab, and she decides to go talk to her mother so she asks the cab driver if he can turn around and go back to Manhattan. His response is rude, albeit in a cursory way, and yet she is so lost and scared that she dissolves into sobs in the back seat. Slate manages to give us a character who has walls and a certain persona, and yet that persona constantly cracks. It's part of her act; it's part of what she \"uses\" for comedy. Her emotions come up against her will. When she is able to harness them, she is funny and even charming. When they get the better of her, she goes down with the ship. You can understand why Donna has loyal friends who put up with all of that. And it's also completely plausible that Max enjoys her so much. He's a subtext kind of guy. He listens to what isn't being said. He is not completely overrun by the onslaught of her wisecracks, and sometimes gives as good as he gets. He is taken aback by her dirty jokes, but isn't judgmental. \"On the page,\" Max may seem like a cliche. But as portrayed by Lacy, he feels like a real guy, someone you've met, someone you know. There are a couple of coincidences in the script that feel artificial, and there's a bit too much reliance on second-unit shots of Manhattan landscapes to get us from one scene to the next. But what is interesting here is the behavior, the subtext coursing beneath the text, the feeling that what comes up for these people is too big to be controlled, and yet they still try to control it. Romantic films, even good ones, often operate from cliche. \"Obvious Child\", an extremely self-aware film, acknowledges those cliches, and yet provides the characters a larger and more chaotic space to be themselves. The film is not anti-romantic. In many ways, it is extremely romantic. Watch Donna's reaction to when Max warms up the butter packets with his hands before giving them to her. It is an automatic gesture on his part, casual, and yet it says everything. She is nearly undone by the moment. \"Obvious Child\" is Robespierre's first feature, and it is an incredibly confident debut. Watching all of these people listen, talk, behave, react, think, work stuff out\u2026that's the genius of \"Obvious Child,\" that's the strength and beauty of its unique wavelength.

{"Title": "Escape from Tomorrow", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "As a movie, \"Escape from Tomorrow\" is a dark, weird, smutty, fitfully amusing comedy that ultimately wears out its welcome. As a provocation, it's aces, especially if\u2014like the film's writer-director, Randy Moore\u2014you hate Disney and everything it stands for.\u00a0 To be clear, I don't hate Disney. In fact I love a good number of the company's films, am fascinated by the history of its theme parks, and own books about the company's founder, Walt Disney. But I'm also a father of two who's visited Disney World on days when I was in a foul mood but had to suck it up and pretend to have a great time. That beleaguered side of me reacted to \"Escape from Tomorrow\" with cathartic glee.\u00a0This\u00a0low-budget black-and-white comedy about a husband and father going mad at Disney World\u00a0is clearly the work of a filmmaker wrestling with demons. It was shot on location in Disney World without permits. Judging from what's onscreen, that was the only way it could have been done: if Disney had known what the cast and crew were up to, they'd never have allowed them anywhere near the parks. \"Escape from Tomorrow\" is an act of cultural vandalism, the feature film equivalent of drawing genitals on cute storybook animals. \u00a0 Advertisement Roy Abramsohn stars as Jim, the beleaguered husband of Emily (Elena Schuber) and father to two small children, Sara (Katelynn Rodriguez) and Eliot (Jack Dalton). He already seems distracted or dissatisfied when we meet him, but the sudden news that he's been fired from his job pushes him over the brink. Something inside of him snaps. He behaves with impatience and then bitter anger toward his wife and kids, develops a pathetic sexual obsession with two beautiful teenage girls (Annet Mahendru and Danielle Safady), and hallucinates sinister visions on harmless rides. The latter include a visit to Disney's \"It's a Small World After All\" that transforms the chirpy, one-world puppet show into a psychedelic nightmare. As Jim, Abramsohn has a bit of the beaten-down schlub quality that Matthew Broderick brought to the hero in \"Election.\" He doesn't sugarcoat the character's unlikable qualities; he puts the desperation front-and-center, and makes sure that Roy owns all of his thoughts, including the sleazy and revolting ones. Moore's themes and vision are too narrow to support a feature-length comedy. It's fine that we never leave Jim's perspective, and that the whole story is shaped, at times deformed, by his mix of despair, lust and resentment; many great movies have stayed anchored to one character's point-of-view. The problem is that Jim's psyche isn't fascinating enough to wallow in for 90 minutes, and the supporting characters offer no relief from the monotony of his distress; they aren't written to suggest that there's more to them than what Jim sees\u2014and that's too bad, because whenever there's a gap between a lead character's perception of reality and reality, it enriches the story. The movie's teenage girls never seem like more than dirty-old-man fantasies, Lolitas skipping and laughing and teasing him. Emily is rarely more than a suffering spouse or a griping shrew (except in a marvelous late scene where she senses the depth of his misery and reaches out to him). We sometimes feel that Jim is not just projecting his pain onto undeserving proxies\u2014that maybe these rhymes-with-witches are his real problem.\u00a0 The movie's wild and disturbing climax redeems some of the movie's missteps. It unleashes the moviemaker's id by way of Jim's flipped-out imagination, and suggests he's right to think that the Mouse has a sinister agenda. There's a sense of missed opportunity at the end: \"Escape from Tomorrow\" could have been a sneaky masterpiece, and it isn't. But it's still a\u00a0vital and significant American feature; all movies should be this \"disappointing.\" \u00a0With its sneaky production history and low-tech special effects (including green-screened backgrounds a couple steps up from a karaoke video), \"Escape from Tomorrow\" is guerrilla art. It lashes out against the placid, sexless, clean-scrubbed version of happiness peddled by Disney, not because it thinks sanitized diversions have no place in American life, but because the Disney vision is as blandly oppressive as Nurse Ratched in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\"\u00a0 Advertisement \"Escape from Tomorrow\" screened at Sundance and EbertFest earlier this year. It got good critical notices and a lot of sight-unseen support, mostly from filmmakers who resented the way that media corporations squash art that tries to comment on their world view, their characters or their corporate history. Some assumed the movie would never get a proper theatrical release.  That Moore's film did, in fact, see the light of day suggests a sea change in media corporations' sense of what the phrase \"Fair Use\" means, and what level of bullying they can get away with. Maybe Disney's lawyers realized it's not appropriate to try to silence a comedy because it dares to treat Disney World and its copyrighted rides and characters as one might treat any other iconic site that families visit, such as the Washington mall or Times Square. To insist otherwise might have invited a legal battle\u2014one that Disney would have lost, once the jury realized that \"Escape from Tomorrow\" was a political as well as an artistic statement, and that the decision to shoot on location was essential to its mood and message.\u00a0 This is a small film set in small world, but its audacity makes it important. It feels like the first salvo in an intellectual property war. The enemy was wise not to shoot back.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Autopsy of Jane Doe", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "A very good year for horror films has one more scary story to haunt your dreams, the effective and creepy \u201cThe Autopsy of Jane Doe.\u201d Like many of the great horror films of 2016, Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal\u2019s thriller marries its concept to solid, character-driven work from the film\u2019s leads. As horror has become one of the best ways for indie filmmakers to tell personal stories, the emphasis on performance has gone up, leading to great acting turns in films like \u201cThe Witch,\u201d \u201cI Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe,\u201d among others. The concept of \u201cThe Autopsy of Jane Doe\u201d would make for a great ghost story around the campfire, but it\u2019s the dedicated work by Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox to ground the flick that makes it truly effective. Advertisement The actors play a father and son who work at one of the most inherently creepy places one could work: a morgue. The opening scenes beautifully set the tone. The two men are playful with each other, but it\u2019s clear that the elder is the knowledgeable one, and his kid is new to the game. Fans of shows like \u201cForensic Files\u201d and \u201cAutopsy\u201d will immediately take to the idea that these two can read a story from a body.  So what story is Jane Doe going to tell them? The film actually opens in one of its only scenes outside of the morgue, as the cops investigate a house full of brutally murder bodies. There\u2019s a dead family in pieces everywhere, but the weirdest thing they find is the naked woman half-buried in the basement. While everyone else is a bloody mess, she doesn\u2019t have a scratch on her. How did she die? Who is she? She ends up on our coroners\u2019 table and starts to tell her story. Internally, she\u2019s an absolute disaster. It looks like she was bound and tortured before she died. Her tongue was cut out. She was burned at some point. But her exterior remains intact. Spotless even. And then things start to get really weird. The director of the cult hit \u201cTroll Hunter\u201d works wonders in the fantastic first hour. He sets up some beautifully realized devices, such as when Cox explains how they used to tie a bell to dead bodies just to make sure they were actually dead instead of in a coma. Any horror fan will laugh, as we\u2019re all well aware that a tinkling bell will play a creepy role about 30 minutes later. It\u2019s a wonderful device, like when a haunted house movie lets us see the creaking door during daylight before it creaks on its own at night. And the first and second act here have a wonderful set-up/pay-off structure to them. As we start to figure out who Jane Doe is, the tension rises and the creepiness increases. \u201cThe Autopsy of Jane Doe\u201d is basically a great haunted house movie\u2014the house just happens to be the morgue. And, again, one can\u2019t undervalue having two strong actors like Hirsch and Cox to sell what this movie is trying to sell. They make the unbelievable feel genuinely terrifying.  This holds true for about an hour of the 86-minute running time and then \u201cJane Doe\u201d turns up the crazy factor and races to a conclusion that doesn\u2019t allow much for character or logic. It\u2019s not uncommon for a horror movie to be more effective in its set-up than its climax. A whispered boo is much scarier than a scream in your face. Luckily, that first hour of \u201cThe Autopsy of Jane Doe\u201d is so clever and well-done that it makes the sins of the finale easy to forgive.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Ivory Tower", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Ivory Tower\" raises a number of fascinating questions and offers numerous facts on the current, deeply flawed state of the American system of higher education but suffers from a lack of focus or even a hint of what we do about the situation. In fact, there are at least three sections of \"Ivory Tower\" that could be branched out into their own, more satisfying standalone documentaries, including profiles of the UnCollege Movement, the recent events at the Cooper Union, and the lessons learned in the relationship between San Jose State University and the online learning company Udacity. There\u2019s enough interesting, raw material in \"Ivory Tower\" to consider but one wishes it was shaped into something more cohesive and pointed in its attack and approach. Advertisement Is college overrated? For so much of American history, college has been sold as the key to the future. More and more, it\u2019s a key that\u2019s coming with baggage, including thousands of dollars in student loans. Competition for prestige among high-profile universities has led to rampant expansion. More programs means more facilities, means more students, means more attention, and so on. And all of it means more tuition. The cost of an education has increased more quickly in the past few decades than any other good or service. And as federal money has been taken away from our country\u2019s education, the loan movement has begun to resemble the subprime housing crisis, giving people debt that their children will have to repay. Worst of all, no one is sufficiently asking what our increasingly in-debt kids are getting for their high-APR loans. Someone should. And \"Ivory Tower\" serves as a way to start the conversation about why education is seen as a financial privilege instead of a right for all who need it or are willing to work for it. Half of our college-educated people in this country under 25 are underemployed or unemployed, with debt that is increasing at rates that should be illegal. Something has to be done. It\u2019s understandable that \"Ivory Tower\" director Andrew Rossi isn\u2019t certain what that \"something\" is but his unfocused approach for at least the first half of his documentary is downright jarring. Stats fly across the screen like the fact that 68% of the students who are paying small fortunes for their education at public universities won\u2019t graduate within four years. And then we\u2019ve moved on before that stat or its impact is placed in context. The film jumps from the impact of Harvard on the education system as a whole to the party school atmosphere at Arizona State University to the interesting story of Deep Springs College, without spending enough time on any of these stories to give them resonance. Until Cooper Union. If you don\u2019t know the story, Cooper Union is a Manhattan college that was founded on the radical model of free education and continued to provide tuition-free learning for decades. Until recently. When a new President, Jamshed Bharucha, came to the conclusion that the school could no longer survive without charging students to learn there, chaos ensued. Critics pointed to the debt amassed by the construction of a very expensive new building on campus and the $700k+ salary of their new leader, and students did what so many critics of millennials claim they are incapable of doing: they staged a revolution. They protested in the form of a sit-in in the President\u2019s office. This chapter of \"Ivory Tower\" is easily its strongest, and could have served as the whole documentary, seeing as it is really the culmination of so many issues in our educational crisis today. Advertisement I had similar feelings about later chapters on the UnCollege movement\u2014a San Francisco-based community of people who are trying to use so many of the tools now available to young people to learn without academia\u2014and the fascinating story of Udacity, one that reminds us of the value of traditional education.  Perhaps Rossi places the Udacity saga near the final act of \"Ivory Tower\" to circle back to the beginning. \"Well, the Harvard model may not be working, but we haven\u2019t found a better one.\" If the message of \"Ivory Tower\" is that we have to accept our broken system, it\u2019s a hard one to take (especially for this father of three). The crucial question that \"Ivory Tower\" fails to ask is the most important one of all: What do we do now?", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Gravity", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's \"Gravity,\" about astronauts coping with disaster, is a huge and technically dazzling film. Watching Sandra Bullock and George Clooney's spacefarers go about their business, you may feel\u2014for the first time since \"The Right Stuff,\" perhaps\u2014that a Hollywood blockbuster grasps the essence of \u00a0a job that many can't imagine without feeling dizzy.\u00a0The panoramas of astronauts tumbling against starfields and floating through space stations are both informative and lovely.\u00a0 But the most surprising and impressive thing about \"Gravity\" isn't its scale, its suspense, or its sense of wonder; it's that, in its heart, it is not primarily a film about astronauts, or space, or even a specific catastrophe. At times it plays like a high-tech version of shipwreck or wilderness survival story that happens to take place among the stars, and that would fit nicely on a double-bill alongside \"Deliverance,\" \"127 Hours,\" \"Cast Away,\" \"Rescue Dawn\" or the upcoming \"All Is Lost.\"\u00a0For all its stunning exteriors, it's really concerned with emotional interiors, and it goes about exploring them with simplicity and directness, letting the actors's faces and voices carry the burden of meaning. \u00a0It's a film about what happens to the psyche as well as the body in the aftermath of catastrophe. \u00a0 Advertisement Not content to observe the agonizing physical details of the astronauts' struggles, \"Gravity\" goes deep into the feelings \u00a0of one character, Bullock's Dr. Ryan Stone, a first-time space traveller who boards a shuttle alongside Clooney's Matt Kowalski to repair the Hubble telescope. When debris destroys the telescope and their ride home, Ryan finds herself marooned in orbit alongside Kowalski, taking an unasked-for crash course in disaster management, learning all she can from her more experienced partner, struggling to control the anxious heartbeat that flutters on the soundtrack along with her shallow breathing and the sporadic hiss of backpack thruster jets.\u00a0 \"Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission,\" Kowalski tells mission control (voiced, in one of Cuar\u00f3n's only film-buffish in-jokes, by Ed Harris, a veteran of both\u00a0\"The Right Stuff\" and \"Apollo 13\"). We hear Kowalski speak this line for the first of many times during the majestic opening shot. We see space, and Earth\u2014and beyond it, a tiny speck that slowly draws close, revealing the mission, the vehicles, the characters.\u00a0 In the hands of lesser storytellers, this shot and other, equally striking ones might play like showboating. (The filmmaker and his regular cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, shot numerous films with spectacular long takes, including \"Children of Men.\") Luckily,\u00a0Cuar\u00f3n, who cowrote the script with his eldest son Jon\u00e1s, roots every moment in a tactile present. The fragility of the body has rarely been spotlit so harshly, throughout the entire running time of a feature. Every time the astronauts move, or don't move, you worry they're going to end up like their colleagues: bodies frozen hard as bricks, faces caved in like pumpkins. Ryan is our stand-in. The movie makes this notion plain by shifting between points-of-view within unbroken long takes. A lot of the time we're in what you might call third person limited, watching Ryan and Kowalski move through their treacherous environment and taking note of objects drifting with them, some menacing, others oddly poignant: a chess piece, a ballpoint pen, a Marvin the Martian doll, a puff of electrical flame, a lone teardrop. But then, gradually, subtly, \"Gravity\" will morph into first person, drifting towards Ryan and then seeming to pass through her helmet, edging closer to her face, then finally pivoting so that we're gazing out through her visor, hearing her voice and breath echo inside her suit as she looks for a space station, for Kowalski; for someone, something, anything to grab onto. Advertisement Some have already complained that \"Gravity\" is too melodramatic, too simplistic, too mystical, too something; that once we figure out that it's about the psychology of Ryan, we may write it off as less imaginative than we hoped. \u00a0I don't believe such shortcomings\u2014if indeed they are shortcomings\u2014can dent this film's awesomeness. If \"Gravity\" were half as good as I think it is, I'd still consider it one of the great moviegoing experiences of my life, thanks to the precision and beauty of its filmmaking.\u00a0 But even if we grant that the movie doesn't have the philosophical ambition of \"2001\", the space adventure to which it's most often compared, fairness demands we recognize that it's trying for something else. \"Gravity\" is reminiscent of \"2001\" mainly because it feels like a feature-length expansion of the sequence in which astronaut Dave Bowman gets locked out of the Jupiter spacecraft without his helmet. Beyond that, it's its own thing, and its storytelling is as simple as its visuals are complex. A surprising number of scenes are theatrically spare: just people talking to each other, telling stories, painting mental pictures for us.\u00a0 For long stretches, Cuar\u00f3n trusts Bullock to give us a one-woman show, and she delivers. Her work here constitutes one of the greatest physical performances I've seen, and she's framed in ways that make each moment resonate. The way she twists and turns and swims through zero gravity is a master class in how to suggest interior states with gestures. An image of Ryan curled up womblike in zero gravity packs a primordial wallop: it's a dream image dredged from the Jungian muck. Some of the shots of Bullock's face through her helmet visor evoke Carl Dreyer's \"The Passion of Joan of Arc,\" the film that perfected the emotionally expressive closeup. \"Gravity\" evokes that silent classic and others\u2014including Maya Deren's experimental short \"Meshes of the Afternoon,\" whose most analyzed sequence, a series of shots boiling evolution down to four gestures, might have influenced the unabashedly metaphorical closing scene of\u00a0\u00a0Cuar\u00f3n's movie. Advertisement If anyone asks me what \"Gravity\" is about, I'll tell them it's a tense adventure about a space mission gone wrong, but once they've seen and absorbed the movie, they'll know the truth. The root word of \"Gravity\" is \"grave.\" That's an adjective meaning weighty or glum or substantial, but it's also a noun: the place where we'll all end up eventually. The film is about that moment when you suffered misfortune that seemed unendurable and believed all hope was lost and that you might as well curl up and die, and then you didn't. Why did you decide to keep going? It's is a mystery as great as any in physics or astronomy, and one we've all grappled with, and transcended.", "Critic": "Delta"}

Ceylan invokes/evokes Chekhov in his\r\nscenario: protagonist Aydin, an aging former theatrical actor, runs a hotel in\r\na picturesque section of Anatolia and desultorily deals with surly tenants on\r\nsome land he owns, a disenchanted (and much younger) wife, a watchful sister,\r\nand various others, revealing the discontents at the roots of all their\r\nrelationship and a deep dissatisfaction with life itself, despite the prestige\r\nand autonomy and leisure that Aydin enjoys.  The movie, which won the Palme d\u2019Or at this year\u2019s Cannes\r\nFilm Festival, has been disparaged by some skeptical critics as a gabfest, and\r\nit\u2019s true, there\u2019s a lot of talk here, and very little of it\u2019s small. But\r\nthat\u2019s not to say that the film is glacially paced; even when staying in the\r\nsame settings, Ceylan\u2019s camerawork and editing are terrifically alert. The\r\ntalk, for all its abstractions, gradually lays bare the poor regard with which\r\nmost of the characters hold each other, and, at about the halfway point, when\r\nAydin (played with glum tenacity by Haluk Bilginer) calls his put-upon spouse\r\n(Melisa S\u00f6zen) a \u201cbored neurotic,\u201d the fur really begins to fly. Not much of\r\nwhat is said by these characters is particularly novel or earth-shaking it\u2019s\r\ntrue, but I think that\u2019s central to what Ceylan is doing here. This is a work\r\nof cinema, not theater or prose, and what counts most in \u201cWinter Sleep,\u201d to me\r\nat least, is not the commonplace sentiments of dysfunction and dread, but\r\nspaces between the words. The accumulation of images imbues the film with a\r\nkind of bleak coziness that brings to life the accusation that Aydin\u2019s sister\r\nNecia (Demet Akbag) levels at him: \u201cIn order not to suffer, you prefer to fool\r\nyourself.\u201d The strength of \u201cWinter Sleep\u201d is not so much in what any of\r\nthe characters say as much as what it needs its near-monumental length to\r\nactually show: which is the way the most seemingly banal circumstances can\r\nthrow you into a dark night of the soul before you even know what\u2019s going on, a\r\nstate of wide-awake despair so calamitous one has no choice but to make a\r\ncompanion of it. That sounds like a paradoxical state\u2014and it is, a painfully\r\nparadoxical one, but it\u2019s a real one, and the signal accomplishment of \u201cWinter\r\nSleep\u201d is that Ceylan\u2019s empathy and technical facility make it palpable in the\r\nartistic realm. It\u2019s a daunting achievement and in a strange way also a\r\ncomfort. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}

The movie, directed by Shawn Christensen from a script he co-wrote with Jason Dolan, begins by signaling the precocious literary brilliance of the title character, played by Logan Lerman in \u201cthe twerp is father to the bro\u201d mode, as he reads to a high school class an \u201cessay\u201d describing a girl he once formed a fascination with. \u201cShe had a virginal quality that contrasted her ice-cold outer shell,\u201d he says vehemently. He goes on to describe how he masturbated to this unnamed girl\u2019s image. He gets giggles from the class and a stern look from a female teacher. Sidney then commiserates with a male teacher, Duane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who\u2019s more sympathetic to his work. The female teacher, he advises Sidney, IS a published author. \u201cOf romance novels,\u201d Sidney sneers. \u201cWhat about Hunter S. Thompson or David Foster Wallace?\u201d Sidney asks earnestly. It is perhaps no coincidence that he names two figures who took their own lives. One of the many things the movie can never quite figure out is that either of those authors would have rather never written a single word had they thought themselves capable of writing a sentence as multi-level-abominable as \u201cShe had a virginal quality that contrasted her ice-cold outer shell.\u201d Advertisement The Movie About A Supposedly Great Writer In Which The Writing The Supposedly Great Writer Produces Kind Of Sucks is not, alas, uncommon. The approximations of Philip Roth that peppered Alex Ross Perry\u2019s \u201cListen Up Philip\u201d never landed smoothly but fortunately the movie had enough misanthropic juice in the story and dialogue to more than get by. What \u201cSidney Hall\u201d has is a lot of misogyny. As in an exchange in which the possible Love of Sidney\u2019s Life tells him that she loves Bob Dylan and horror movies and his response is \u201care you sure you\u2019re a girl?\u201d It also has a lot of what have to be shared fantasies of the screenwriters. The idea that a high school kid, writing a novel with the spectacularly on-the-nose title Suburban Tragedy, can get to the top of the New York Times best seller list for eight\u00a0months, is a big reach. (Would that Thompson and Wallace had done so well!) The movie gifts young Sidney with an indulgent assistant, a hotsy-totsy love affair, and a lot of Downsides To Fame that are even more narcissistic than the imaginary upsides. A reader\u2019s dramatic suicide, accompanied by a statement that Sidney Hall has put his cult on the path to \u201cexpose the suburban underbelly of America no matter what the cost.\u201d A D.B.

How postmodernly \u201cBound for Glory\u201d can you get, people? The movie gives Sidney a kind of stalker, known only as \u201cThe Seeker,\u201d played by Kyle Chandler, who shows up at libraries and bookstores where beardo Sidney shows up to burn copies of his own works, because The Fame Is Bad. The various story threads resolve themselves in flashbacks and flashforwards, the most memorable of which intercuts Sidney being harangued by his mother and Sidney trying to save the life of the woman he has finally realized is his own true love. This is some pretty can\u2019t-live-with-them, can\u2019t-live-without-them stuff, for sure. A climactic flashback reveals the root of Sidney\u2019s guilt has to do with his having watched a video cassette of an unspeakable act that he means to take to the authorities. Only he leaves it in the VCR and the aforementioned mother discovers it, freaks out, and a big old mess ensues. This guy is supposed to be a genius, remember. On the plus side, the movie\u2019s production values are very nice and its cast is notable. And as it happens, neither of those are pluses, because what they mean ultimately is that good money is put into this kind of worthless woman-hating garbage even now.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Tribes of Palos Verdes", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Based on a 1997 novel by Joy Nicholson, \u201cThe Tribes of Palos Verdes\u201d immediately tips the viewer off with the faux-sociology of its blandly ironic title. The story of an affluent family breaking apart after a move from Michigan to the tony coastal town in Los Angeles County, the movie is narrated by the family\u2019s female teen, Medina (Maika Monroe). We first see her swimming in the family\u2019s new, blue-upon-blue swimming pool. Explaining her close bond with her brother, she flatly intones in voiceover, \u201cThat may sound f\u2014ked up, but it\u2019s true. It\u2019s a twin thing.\u201d The prospect of spending the next two hours seeing the world through this character\u2019s eyes is not, at this point, pleasing. Advertisement Meet the Masons: Dad Phi (Justin Kirk) is an innovative cardiologist hoping to make bank and achieve medical celeb status in the new environs. Mom Sandy (Jennifer Garner) is a reluctant Californian, stressed out by all the phonies (the couple\u2019s first night out is at\u00a0 the Friendly Hills Country Club\u2014get it? It\u2019s not really friendly) and the \u201cincessant\u201d crashing of the waves down the hill. Brother Jim (Cody Fern) is preoccupied with popularity, which comes easy to him. Medina is searching for her own groove, which does not concern itself with popularity. High school seen through her eyes is a farrago of distracted vulgarity; all the shots of her classmates show them engaged in simulating sexual activity in distasteful ways. She buys a surfboard from a fatboy neighbor who\u2019s sitting on a few; he charges her a look at her bare breasts. She convinces Jim that surf\u2019s up for the both of them. The sport provides relief for a little while. As Medina puts it: \u201cFor the first time in a long time, we felt like we were in our treehouse again.\u201d A chaos of stars filled the night skies of Palos Verdes, but everything else was regulated,\u201d Medina observes. Not regulated: the emotions of the uniformly unhappy folk in her orbit. Phil falls for the real-estate agent who sold the Masons their home (Alicia Silverstone, not given much to do). Backing out of family life, he leaves Sandy unmoored. Jim, manipulated by his mom into pretending to accept a role as the \u201cman of the house\u201d flips out and starts drugging heavily. This is a world in which nobody is interested in, let alone able to, understand the suffering of those closest to them. In a scene early in the movie, an upset Sandy starts going at her full-body girdle with scissors. In the middle of this action, which would be disturbing to any human being who witnessed is, Medina walks in and nonchalantly asks \u201cMom? I need you to sign something for school.\u201d Because that\u2019s how strong her anomie is. This is pretty standard stuff, and it\u2019s not always rendered too convincingly. Directing brothers Brendan and Emmett Malone have a few tricksy formal tics up their sleeves\u2014long-held overhead views of their characters, shots that begin completely out of focus and are brought into focus within seconds\u2014meant to convey how much is \u201coff\u201d in the world where the tennis-club wives wear matching skirts like uniforms. The middle of the movie softens up, as Medina meets and finds an affinity with Adrian (Noah Silver), the son of Phil\u2019s new squeeze. Medina is snooty at first, but Adrian\u2019s sincerity wins her over, and the movie offers up some sequences of unforced lyricism before bringing the hammer down on the family tragedy. Advertisement The acting is good all around but that, too, improves in the quieter moments. Monroe, best known for her work in \u201cIt Follows,\u201d is tough and committed, and Jennifer Garner\u2019s portrayal of a mad housewife sprinting to a meltdown is acute, even if its does require her to tamp down pretty much all of her engaging life-positive qualities. The Malloys are experienced at shooting surfing, and the scenes on the water make the viewer understand just how Medina gets the bug.

{"Title": "Maps to the Stars", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "David Cronenberg is near the top of the list of directors whose works resist snap judgments. His mix of black comedy and unabashed melodrama is so delicate, and in some ways so off-putting, that at times it's hard to tell if he's kidding or serious (the answer is usually both). He's been described as a horror filmmaker, and his longstanding fascination with bodily invasion and the fragility of flesh confirms that label\u2014or does it? A good many of his films play like horror movies even if they don't have genetic mutations or other obvious \"monsters.\" Why? Maybe because he's less interested in gore and goo than in the beasts within: the monstrous nature of obsession and desire; the difficulty of escaping oneself, physically or emotionally; the cruelty of the societies that enfold and define his characters. Look back over Cronenberg's filmography, and you realize that he hasn't made an according-to-Hoyle horror picture since 1986's \"The Fly.\" The horrific quality seems to come more from his being appalled by what people can be, and do\u2014and from being sympathetic to their urges anyway.  Advertisement \"Maps to the Stars,\" written by Bruce Wagner, is another work in the good old Cronenbergian vein. Although it's been dismissed in some quarters as minor Cronenberg\u2014and criticized for \"getting Hollywood wrong,\" or something like that; as if \"Dead Ringers\" cared about the fine points of gynecology\u2014it's a sneakily powerful movie, so much so that its conceptual thinness isn't a deal-breaker. Not for nothing did Cronenberg model his remake of \"The Fly\" on tragic opera, then re-stage it with his regular composer Howard Shore as an actual opera, with a libretto by David Henry Hwang. This new film's cast of anxious, duplicitous, sometimes violent creative types rattle off declamatory dialogue so overwrought that it could be treated as arias scored for a 40-piece orchestra. The characters inhabit a Los Angeles that seems as intimate, even inbred, as a stereotypical backwoods town: every other scene reveals that characters you didn't know were connected are, in fact, part of an extended family, united not just by blood, but hunger for validation. They want luxury and fame as well, but those are signifiers of what they're truly after: adoration. Love. Unconditional acceptance. Julianne Moore stars as Havana Segrand, a formidable actress whose star has begun to fade now that she's passed 50. Like a lot of characters in this film\u2014and a lot of characters in Cronenberg's films, period, and Wagner's fiction\u2014she's defined by her tragic past, and knows this all too well, and is palpably desperate to escape it and re-create herself. Ironically, though (and appropriately, since this is Cronenberg) she's trying to escape herself by crawling deeper into a psychological cage that's enclosed her since birth: Havana wants to star in a biographical drama about her late mother Clarice Taggart (Sarah Gadon), a mercurial, psychologically and sexually abusive actress who could be a combination of Frances Farmer and Joan Crawford.  This one subplot, about an actress trying to master the awful memories of her mother by figuratively becoming her, gives you some clue what Cronenberg and Wagner are up to, not just with Havana but with all the major characters. Like Cronenberg's little-seen but fascinating \"Spider,\" \"Maps to the Stars\" often feels like a ghost story made by people who don't believe in the supernatural. The mother appears to her daughter in a very straightforward way\u2014as she might manifest herself in a theatrical production. But even though she's clearly an outgrowth of Havana's mangled psyche, you have to count her as an accusing spirit, rattling around in the haunted house of her daughter's damaged mind, and saying the most vile, undermining things. (As if the movie didn't already subtly echo \"The Shining,\" Cronenberg has Clarice appearing to Havana in a bathtub: shades of room 237.) Advertisement Havana, who will do or say just about anything to play her mother and hopefully win an Oscar, is the most vivid of the film's troubled souls, thanks mainly to Moore's utter disinterest in seeming powerful or dignified or otherwise stereotypically movie star-like. From \"Short Cuts\" and \"Safe\" onward, this actress has played troubled, desperate or generally put-upon characters so often that the best actress Oscar she won for \"Still Alice\" might as well have been mounted on a torture rack. But Havana proves merely the brightest star in this film's constellation of scheming sufferers, a bunch whose manias are a bit too contrived and schematic, but which fascinate anyway, thanks to the actors' virtuosity and Cronenberg's control of tone.  Havana's regular therapist/masseuse/TV psychologist is a self-help guru named Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Cusack), a man who presents himself as selfless and caring, but seems determined to crack open repressed minds mainly so he can root around and provoke extreme reactions. (When Stafford manipulates Havana's body on a yoga mat, Cronenberg's staging suggests sex, sometimes rape.)\u00a0  Havana's new personal assistant, Stafford's daughter Agatha Weiss (Mia Wasikowska), wears long gloves to cover arms that were burned in a mysterious fire; at first she seems almost Pollyanna-sweet, but soon enough she reveals a capacity for ruthlessness that rivals Havana's. The ghost story parallels continue via Agatha, who haunts Stafford; his brittle, fearful wife Cristina (Olivia Williams, in the latest in a series of knockout supporting performances), and Agatha's kid brother Benjie. The youngest Weiss is a cruel and territorial former child star who's looking to escape the gilded prison of juvenile idol-hood. Benjie is played by Evan Bird of \"The Killing,\" an actor whose haircut and clipped delivery revoke Frankie Muniz on \"Malcolm in the Middle\" when the character isn't doing a snotnosed power-broker routine, lounging around nightclubs like Leonard DiCaprio in his post-\"Titanic\" period. Compared to all these misfits, slimeballs and emotional basket cases, Robert Pattinson's limo driver and aspiring screenwriter Jerome Fontana seems well-adjusted, but as is so often the case with Wagner's characters, you'd best not get too comfortable with him. (This is the second time Pattinson has spent time in a limo for Cronenberg, after \"Cosmopolis,\" and the second time he's delivered a top-notch, blase-sexy-decadent performance.) I'm not convinced that the film's themes and situations are deep enough or well-articulated enough to deserve the brilliant filmmaking and acting placed in their service. As the story wears on and we glean new bits of information establishing the characters' connections, the story starts to seem less operatically inevitable than contrived and convenient: too neat, and trying to camouflage its too-neatness with wrenching scenes of violence and self-abasement. By the time you get to the end, Cronenberg has pinned all his people against the screen like so many laboratory specimens, ripped off their scabs, and vivisected their longings: an old wound here, a long--deferred dream there. Still, the movie sticks with you. It's a fleeting nightmare that refuses to fade. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Youth in Oregon", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "This is a big month for bad wordplay in independent film titles. There\u2019s a picture opening called \u201cDark Night\u201d which was inspired by the 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, where another movie whose name you\u2019ll never guess was screening. As for this item, directed by Joel David Moore (who\u2019s also a reasonably busy character actor, although he doesn\u2019t appear here) from a script by first-time-feature-writer Andrew Eisen, it is not a movie about young people in Oregon, as one might glean during the opening of the film, which designates Frank Langella as the lead actor and shows him, shirtless, in front of a bathroom mirror, being not terribly youthful. No, the title is a play on the word \u201ceuthanasia.\u201d Langella\u2019s character, newly 80 years old, lives, imposingly, in the house owned by his adult daughter Kate (Christina Applegate) and her husband Brian (Billy Crudup). Things are a little crowded in the house: Kate and Brian have two kids, hot-to-trot (if you\u2019ll excuse the expression) cheerleader Annie (Nicola Peltz) and rather more withdrawn Nick (Alex Shaffer), and Langella\u2019s Ray has a wife, Estelle (Mary Kay Place). The movie begins on a busy morning. Brian\u2019s asked to attend a clogged toilet, Annie\u2019s taking under-the-shirt selfies to text to her football-player boyfriend, and the ceaselessly cranky Ray has a doctor\u2019s appointment.  Advertisement At said appointment, Ray learns that the heart surgery he had a couple of years before hasn\u2019t entirely fixed his problems, and he confidentially tells his doctor he doesn\u2019t want any new surgery. That evening, at a party for his 80th birthday, upstaging an egregiously overacting waiter who goes on at length about a meal served with \u201ca creamy white sauce with herbs and spices\u201d (seriously, the guy comes on like he\u2019s in a Monty Python sketch), Ray gets up and announces that he has decided to die, and that he wants to go to Oregon, where he owns a property and where the laws pertaining to checking out with extreme prejudice are somewhat agreeable, and get it over with. The thing is, he insists on going from the East Coast to Oregon by car, because he doesn\u2019t fly. I know, I too raised an eyebrow at a character who is hell bent on ending his own life but won\u2019t take an airplane to get to he place where he\u2019s going to do it. But this is the kind of movie \u201cYouth in Oregon\u201d is: a movie that has to have a Road Trip, because it will only be through a Road Trip that the characters can go through the kind of self-discovery that is the very raison d\u2019etre of such entertainments. And so, with Brian offering to drive even though he thinks he\u2019s faking out Ray and Estelle\u2014the idea is he\u2019ll talk some sense into his father-in-law and they\u2019ll all drive back home together\u2014the journey, accompanied by a solemn original music score fueled by minimal piano and mournful cello, begins. Ray insists on listening to birdcall CDs in the car. Stopping for lunch, he gets tetchy about not getting any mayo on sandwich, and when Brian wryly brings up Viagra for some reason, Ray gets to boasting about past sexual prowess, and loudly, so the \u201cfeisty old guy acts embarrassingly in a restaurant\u201d requirement is checked off. As Brian\u2019s driving falters on account of being tired, Estelle, apparently a current or former nurse, offers him some uppers, and indulges a bit herself, so the \u201ccomedic bonding via pharmaceuticals\u201d requirement is checked off. And so on. At Salt Lake City, Josh Lucas turns up as Ray\u2019s estranged son, and the resentment between them is so thick that of course this character is the only one in whom Ray confides his condition. Back home, Annie keeps giving Kate trouble, and the movie gets padded in an unusual way, that is, with the suggestion of a sex scene between Annie and the aforementioned football player boyfriend (Will Janowitz). They\u2019re supposed to be on the outs because the aforementioned under-the-shirt selfies leaked to the high school populace in general, and when Kate walks in on the bubbling-up action, she is none too pleased. Yeah, I don\u2019t know either. And on it goes, all coming together in the foreshadowed Oregon property (which is well-kept in the way that such places are only in some movies) and with one character pleading \u201cPlease help me fix our family\u201d followed by a requisite reverse shot with a wide\u00a0angle lens taking in a beautiful view of nature to contemplate as a human gesture of reconciliation is contemplated, then executed. Is this all well-acted? It certainly is, especially by Langella. But all things being equal, I\u2019d prefer to see him in a revival of \u201cThe Man Who Came To Dinner.\u201d Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Ruby (Jamie Chung), a Chinese-American new to Hong Kong, stands outside a bar attempting to track down her friends. She has no idea where she is. A guy overhears her and steps in to help. This is Josh (Bryan Greenberg), who has lived in Hong Kong for 10 years. He's \"in finance.\" He knows his way around and speaks Cantonese. After momentary hesitation on her part, the two of them set out into the neon-gleam glamour of Hong Kong on a night-long \"walk and talk.\" Their bantering conversation has all the markings of a successful (albeit accidental) first date, punctuated by sight-seeing. The formula of \"Already\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong,\" written, directed, and produced by Emily Ting (her first feature) is one that has worked before.  Advertisement But the film lacks the underlying subtext that grounded similar hopeful-yet-doomed-romance stories in the past. The dialogue, charmingly delivered by the two leads, remains on a surface jokey level. The stakes are not high enough for either character and the two-people-at-a-fork-in-the-road story never comes to life, a practically fatal flaw. The essential element that such stories must achieve is the knowledge that the two characters need to be together. An audience must ache for the characters to break through to deeper intimacy with one another.  As Josh walks Ruby to her destination, they get to know each other and he shows her the sights. Josh expresses dissatisfaction with his finance job and wants to quit and be a novelist. (Of course he does.) Ruby, who barely knows him, launches into an inspirational speech about taking chances. He appears blown away by her banal insight. It's hard to believe he has never heard such a thing before. But it sets up the too-easy idea that his \"brief encounter\" with Ruby changes the course of his life. Ruby, too, a toy-designer, has unrealized dreams.  These are familiar devices and they can work. Ruby and Josh are so financially fortunate (no crime in that, they both work hard) it has softened them, made them lazy, complacent. Ruby barely notices Hong Kong, and complains about the lack of Netflix and the fact that it is impossible to get good Mexican food. Josh knows the cool non-tourist places to go, but has no perspective on his circumstances outside of the fact that, to Los Angelenos, it's \"already\u00a0tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong.\" Ruby and Josh, then, seem un-curious, and un-engaged with their own lives. It's hard to invest in two people who have so readily taken the easy way out.  Advertisement Ruby and Josh both have off-screen partners who make their presence known through phone messages or Outlook reminders of an upcoming Skype call. Their emotions towards their respective partners are ambivalent at best, and the problem with that is that the two come off as people looking for an excuse to cheat as opposed to a situation much more unstable and important. You know a \"romance\" film isn't working when you think in exasperation, \"Oh, go ahead, just cheat if your relationship bores you so much. No one'll know.\" Or: \"Break up with your partner. For God's sake, you're not married. No harm no foul.\" It's not the most romantic vibe.  Cinematographer Josh Silfen provides a welcome variety of angles to all the talk, the camera sometimes following the two from behind, or swinging around to move along ahead of them. Silfen also shows a visual sensitivity to the lights of Hong Kong: they blur and twinkle in the background/foreground, creating a dreamy atmosphere. It's a poetic style that serves a purpose: despite the attention-getting surroundings, the focus is on the one-on-one interaction of Ruby and Josh.\u00a0 The style keeps \"Already\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong\" from being a glorified travelogue, but unfortunately it also hones in on the lack of chemistry between the two leads. Both Greenberg and Chung were executive producers on the film. Both are obviously talented. Greenberg is effortlessly charming in a very real-guy kind of way. And Chung manages the switch-backs of mood and energy with ease. But Josh and Ruby \"bond\" during a conventional shopping montage, where they haggle over the price of a selfie stick, and an awkward scene where they get their fortunes told. Think of River Phoenix and Lili Taylor in \"Dogfight,\" which has a similar \"sightseeing\" structure, or Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in \"Before Sunrise\" paying the guy lying by the river to write a poem for them, and the difference is palpable. What is missing is the magic of connection.  \"Already\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong\" is in the long tradition of extended \"meet-cutes,\" films like Vincente Minnelli's \"The Clock,\" David Lean's \"Brief Encounter,\" Nancy Savoca's \"Dogfight\" and Richard Linklater's \"Before\" trilogy. There are elements of cultural disorientation too, reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's \"Lost in Translation.\" It is clear that Ting knows the \"bucket\" in which she wants to place her story, and the mood of self-control and bittersweet longing she wants to create. There are moments, brief moments, when that tone is achieved, but overall Ruby and Josh's connection has more in common with the feather-weight \"relationship\" of Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro in \"Falling in Love\" than the torment of \"Brief Encounter\" or the urgency of \"The Clock.\" If nothing else, \"Already\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong\" is an object lesson in just how difficult it is to make a film successful with this story-structure. It reminds us what a miracle \"The Clock\" or \"Before Sunrise\" were, the stories shimmering with delicacy and inference, in-depth conversations leading to connections more intellectual than sexual, masterpieces of barely-controlled passion and longing. \"Already\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong\" suffers in comparison.

{"Title": "Clouds of Sils Maria", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Depending on where you sit, this movie\u2019s a draw for very\r\ndifferent reasons.

Which is not to say that movies like\r\n\u201cMaps To The Stars\u201d (Pattinson working for the second time with maestro of\r\nunsettling content David Cronenberg) or this Stewart co-starrer are fated to\r\nrack up \u201cTwilight\u201d-comparable numbers. But they will be seen by a segment of\r\nthe mass audience that in most other circumstances isn\u2019t interested in auteurs.\r\nThe Stewart-intrigue factor is in itself a double-edged sword, because for\r\nevery 10,000 growing teens for whom Stewart can do no wrong, there\u2019s one film critic,\r\namateur or professional, who still is not sure if Stewart \u201ccan act.\u201d (I am not\r\none of these; I was impressed by her in \u201cPanic Room,\u201d \u201cUndertow,\u201d and \u201cInto The\r\nWild,\u201d to name three of her pre-\u201cTwilight\u201d films.) They look to films such as\r\nthis one, and another recent Stewart indie, \u201cCamp X-Ray,\u201d to settle the\r\nquestion for them once and for all.  Advertisement Then there are those for whom this movie\u2019s a draw because of\r\nits writer/director, Olivier Assayas, working here not just with Stewart but\r\nwith the great French actress Juliette Binoche, who was also in Assayas\u2019\r\nterrific 2008 family drama \u201cSummer Hours.\u201d Assayas is one of world cinema\u2019s\r\nmost penetrating and unpredictable talents; for instance, the two films he made\r\nprior to this one were \u201cSomething In The Air,\u201d an affecting, autobiographical\r\ncoming-of-age story of politics and cinema in the early \u201870s, and before that,\r\nthe sweeping, bracing, not-at-all-sweet \u201cCarlos,\u201d a trenchant biopic of the\r\ntitular real-life terrorism perpetrator whose activities galvanized Europe for\r\na period. \u201cClouds of Sils Maria\u201d is entirely different in some ways from those\r\ntwo films, but its invented worlds are very much in keeping with Assayas\u2019\r\nconcerns about how art and reality intertwine and feed off of each other.  The setup for the picture seems to promise a story of\r\nrivalry among artists: the movie begins on a train; world-renowned actress\r\nMaria (Binoche) is on her way to visit her artistic mentor Wilhelm Melchior,\r\nand deliver a speech at a ceremony honoring the reclusive theater master. Maria\r\nhas her efficient but frazzled and very hip young American assistant Val\r\n(Stewart) in tow; Val\u2019s the one in charge of the schedules, the multiple\r\nsmartphones, and the texting, and it\u2019s Val who first learns that Melchior, the\r\nman they\u2019re on their way to see, has died.  This loss changes the dynamic of the event. Maria has barely\r\ntime to register her loss than she\u2019s regaled with Chanel in a theater corridor;\r\nwhisked through a photo shoot; reintroduced to a former co-star she never\r\nliked; and approached by a hot young theater director to appear in a revival of\r\nthe Melchior play that made her famous. Playing, and this is no small thing,\r\nnot the ing\u00e9nue role that she is now to old for, but the role of an older, more\r\nembittered character. Set to play the younger woman\u2019s role is of course a\r\nyounger woman, a scandal-riddled star played by Chloe Grace Moretz and\r\ninitially seen mainly via paparazzi videos Val finds for Maria on YouTube.\r\nAfter this flurry of activity Val and Maria repair to Melchior\u2019s house in the\r\ntitle village. It\u2019s not far from this place that a particular cloud formation\r\ncalled the Maloja Snake, which provides the Melchior play with its own title,\r\noccurs. Aside from feeding each other lines from Melchior\u2019s play, and arguing\r\nabout life and art and career, Maria and Val aspire to go on a hike and witness\r\nthe snake-like cloud formation as it appears. In the meanwhile, elsewhere in\r\nEurope, Jo-Ann (Moretz) and her latest male conquest, a boy toy with literary\r\npedigree, hone in on, you might have guessed it, an opportunity to stretch\r\ncreative muscles and/or gain some form of artistic cred; for whatever reason,\r\nJo-Ann is hungry for a form of respectability even if she can\u2019t quite fathom\r\nwhat kind, not to even mention why.  Advertisement In pr\u00e9cis form this material looks like an unlikely walk\r\ninto \u201cAll About Eve\u201d territory for Assayas, only with more self-reflexivity.\r\nBut in spite of the superficial dynamics of the\r\nyoung-actress-meets/conquers-older-star scenario, which are fully acknowledged,\r\n\u201cClouds of Sils Maria\u201d is oodles more poetic and enigmatic than the term\r\n\u201cbackstage drama\u201d generally encompasses. It isn\u2019t a story of predatory ambition\r\nor women stabbing each other in the back; all the characters in the movie have\r\ntheir reasons, but the film, at least in the show business aspects of its\r\nstory, is concerned with the paradox of self-preservation within an enterprise\r\nthat requires you have to invest your trust with so many other people. Artistic\r\ncreation begins in the first person singular, but then turns plural, and not\r\neveryone who gets on board makes it all the way to the end of the trip. To that\r\nend, Assayas executes a gambit in the final fifth of the movie that makes\r\nmatters all the more enigmatic. It\u2019s almost as if the conflicts the film\r\ndepicts up until this point\u2014rendered in convincing, epigrammatic dialogue and\r\naction, performed with sometimes searing conviction by Binoche and Stewart in\r\nparticular\u2014have suddenly been deemed too pat by the filmmaker. His way of\r\nshaking thing up is\u2026intriguing, for sure. It's one of those moves that make a second\r\nviewing worth contemplating. In any event, the pleasures of the acting and the\r\never-acute visuals are apt to make a second viewing a distinct pleasure, even\r\nif it doesn\u2019t solve anything.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Columbus", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The buildings rise up out of the grass and trees like relics of a mysterious more sophisticated civilization. They are abstract, startling, sometimes anti-gravitational. They are not monuments. They were built for utilitarian purposes: banks, offices, a church, a library, a hospital. These geometric Modernist buildings pepper the landscape of the \"Midwest Mecca of Architecture,\" Columbus, Indiana, and were designed by some of the most innovative architects of the 20th century: it's no wonder people travel there from all over to take architecture tours. Columbus' architecture is the canvas for \"Columbus,\" the stunning directorial debut of Kogonada (mainly known up until now as a video essayist, whose Vimeo page\u00a0is a great archive of visual analysis). What Kogonada has done with \"Columbus\" (along with cinematographer Elisha Christian) is to blend the background into the foreground and vice versa, so that you see things through the eyes of the two architecture-obsessed main characters. Watching the film is almost like feeling the muscles in your eyes shift, as you look up from reading a book to stare out at the ocean. From the very first shot, it's clear that the buildings will be essential. They are a part of the lives unfolding in their shadows. Sometimes it almost seems like they are listening.\u00a0 Advertisement There is a story in \"Columbus.\" What is remarkable is how intense it is, given the stillness and quiet of Kogonada's style, and the focus with which he films the buildings.\u00a0 A Korean-born man named Jin (John Cho) travels to Columbus to care for his father, who is in the hospital following a catastrophic collapse. Accompanying him is an old friend (and possibly onetime lover), who was also his father's star pupil, played by Parker Posey. Jin has a distant relationship with his father. He can't connect with the worry and sadness his friend is feeling. On a separate track initially, we meet Casey (Haley Lu Richardson), working as a page at the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library (one of the most important interiors in the film). Casey has graduated from high school but has put off going to college perhaps indefinitely because her mother is a former meth addict. (\"Meth is really big here,\" says Casey. \"Meth and Modernism.\") She fears what will happen to her mother without her. Casey and a coworker (Rory Culkin) have interesting discussions, sitting amidst the towering stacks, their conversations a blend of tentative flirting, kindness, and gentle debate. One day, Jin bums a cigarette from Casey. They strike up a conversation.\u00a0 Over the course of \"Columbus,\" Casey, obsessed with architecture, takes Jin around, showing him her favorite buildings (she has a list). Jin is significantly older than Casey, but he treats her as a peer. There is instantly an intimacy between them, perhaps because both are so exhausted by their life circumstances. Their dynamic is fascinating. There's an irritable quality to some of it, as though neither one of them wants to let the other \"get away with\" just skating off the surface of things. When Casey rattles off facts about the famous glass bank designed by Eero Saarinen, Jin gets bored. He pushes her to go deeper: what does the building make you feel? There were only a couple of moments when the script was a little on the nose. But even in those moments the characters were wandering through such interesting spaces that there was always plenty to look at.\u00a0 Kogonada places their human figures against striking man-made backdrops with extreme care. He chooses his angles meticulously. There isn't an uninteresting shot in the whole thing. Shots repeat. Alleyways, sculptures, doorways, glass walls, the clocktower with the asymmetrical clockface, the church with the asymmetrical cross ... we go back to them again and again, Kogonada giving us time to contemplate them, to sink into them. There's so much sadness in the film, it seeps into the air. Kogonada allows space for it, interspersing the conversations between Jin and Casey, or Casey and her mother, with long still shots of the library's striking ceiling, of the glass bank gleaming at night, the glass walkway hovering over a river, of the two brick monoliths floating in the air, almost, but not quite, touching. It's a profound approach. The depth of emotion the film stirred up surprised me. I got so involved in these two people's lives. I cared about them. I liked eavesdropping on their conversations. Advertisement When I first moved to New York, every time I caught a glimpse of the Chrysler Building's whimsical jewel-like crown, my breath would catch in my throat. Eventually, over time, I got used to it as part of my everyday world. But there are moments, usually at dusk, when suddenly it's like I see it for the first time, and I stare upward, taking a moment to appreciate that architect William Van Alen thought that building up, that he saw something that beautiful in his mind, and that he knew what it would add to the skyline: something so tall, and yet also so delicate. I try to remind myself: Make sure to look at the Chrysler Building on occasion. Make sure to appreciate it. \"Columbus\" is a movie about the experience of looking, the interior space that opens up when you devote yourself to looking at something, receptive to the messages it might have for you. Movies (the best ones anyway) are the same way. Looking at something in a concentrated way requires a mind-shift. Sometimes it takes time for the work to even reach you, since there's so much mental ballast in the way. The best directors point to things, saying, in essence: \"Look.\"\u00a0I haven't been able to get \"Columbus\" out of my mind.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Vault", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "On one of the worst moviegoing weekends of the year\u2014go check out our reviews of \u201cJackals,\u201d \u201cTemple,\u201d and \u201cGoon: Last of the Enforcers\u201d for just a taste of the awful\u2014it was even more disconcerting than usual to hear that \"The Vault\" wouldn\u2019t be made available early for reviews. Yes, there are films that screen for critics that end up being surprisingly solid\u2014maybe the studio just doesn\u2019t have the confidence they should in it\u2014but it\u2019s more often that they\u2019re trying to hide a piece of junk. So, while I desperately try to approach each film with as much optimism as possible, it was difficult when I sat down to watch \u201cThe Vault\u201d to not be a little concerned. Much to my surprise, this genre hybrid has its moments\u2014way more than several of the films this week being made widely available to critics. It won\u2019t change your life, but it won\u2019t make you angry either. Labor Day weekend for a limited and VOD release? That\u2019s almost a positive review. Advertisement Sadly, \u201calmost\u201d is as good as I can get for \u201cThe Vault,\u201d a film that merges the bank robbery flick with a haunted house movie. Yes, it\u2019s \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d meets \u201cThe Haunting.\u201d And while that\u2019s an undeniably fun idea, director Dan Bush (\u201cThe Signal\u201d) doesn\u2019t quite know how to pull off either half. Both the heist movie and the spooky flick are underdeveloped with the former lacking the intense dedication to geography that puts you in the middle of the scene and the latter resorting too often to jump scares and undefined rules of the game. And then there\u2019s the ending, which is so resolutely stupid that I suspect the few people who do see this in theaters this weekend will throw their remaining popcorn at the screen. Co-written by Bush and Conal Byrne, \u201cThe Vault\u201d is a (mostly) single-setting affair at what looks like a relatively ordinary bank on what seems like a relatively ordinary morning. A young woman named Leah (Francesca Eastwood, Clint\u2019s daughter) is applying for a job as a teller; another woman named Vee (Taryn Manning) is complaining about checks that shouldn\u2019t have bounced; a local cop (Clifton Collins, Jr.) is flirting with another teller named Susan (Q\u2019orianka Kilcher). There\u2019s a lot of noise coming from outside from a fire down the street, and a trio of firemen enter the bank to make sure it\u2019s secure as well\u2014and then they\u2019re revealed to be robbers, working in conjunction with Leah and Vee. In fact, the two ladies are sisters, backing up their brother, the head fireman/robber Michael (Scott Haze), who needs some cash to get out of a really bad situation. They\u2019re not gonna hurt anyone. They\u2019ll just take what they need and leave. The problems start when the siblings discover that there\u2019s not much money in this small bank\u2014only about $70k. That\u2019s when another employee named Ed (James Franco) steps in to tell them a secret\u2014there\u2019s a second vault in the basement, and that one\u2019s got millions in it. Of course, there\u2019s a reason no one goes in the basement vault, and the robbers release something ancient and evil when they break into it. Before you know it, people are seeing shapes that don\u2019t show up on the security cameras and doing awfully gory things to themselves. Now, the robbers and employees have to escape something much worse than a federal crime. Advertisement Eastwood is a charismatic lead, and the rest of the supporting cast is adequate, but Bush can\u2019t quite figure out what movie he\u2019s making. He needed to co-write and direct a bank robbery film that worked on its own terms, without the hulking ghosts in the basement, but we know that\u2019s not this movie, and so the first act is something of a dull waiting game, waiting for the carnage to kick in. Once it does, I was surprised at how much the leads worked to keep the silliness from verging into camp. Eastwood, Kilcher and Haze sell the confusion and fear of their predicament. And while Franco looks bored too often, his is a smaller role than the poster would have you believe.  Ultimately, \u201cThe Vault\u201d isn\u2019t silly enough to be horrendously memorable or tense enough to be effective as the genre exercise it could have been. It falls into that underdeveloped gap in the middle. Maybe that\u2019s why the studio hid it from critics. It wasn\u2019t that it was awful, it was that they forgot they were releasing it.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Every Thing Will Be Fine", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The opening and closing sequences of \"Every Thing Will Be Fine,\" the first\r\nfiction feature from German director Wim Wenders in almost a decade, are among\r\nthe most masterful he\u2019s created, and over the course of his long career he\u2019s\r\ncreated quite a few such scenes \u2026 and, more to the point, quite a few such whole\r\nfilms. But bear with me.  The opening sequence sees young writer Tomas (James Franco)\r\nseeking space to create in a fisherman\u2019s hut on a frozen lake. Dispirited,\r\nunproductive, he tools around on land a bit, having intermittent tetchy phone\r\nconversations with his girlfriend Sara (Rachel McAdams). Driving in a snowstorm,\r\nhe\u2019s distracted, and has an automobile mishap. He\u2019s relieved to find a\r\ncompletely intact, but very shaken up child propped right next to his front\r\nbumper, and walks the boy to the remote farm house up the hill, from which he\r\nwas no doubt darting out with his plastic sled. Once they get to the house, the\r\nother shoe drops when they meet the boy\u2019s mother, Kate (Charlotte Gainsbourg).\r\nThere\u2019s almost no dialogue, only a calm command of cinema language, conjuring\r\nsuspense, dread and poignancy, enhanced by Wenders\u2019 expressive use of 3D, a format he also used for his spectacular 2011 dance documentary \u201cPina.\u201d  Advertisement So far so good, at least as far as the movie is concerned.\r\nNot so much for Tomas, who\u2019s traumatized by the accident to the extent that he\r\nchecks out on life big time, ending in a hospital bed after what Sara\r\nrecognizes as a half-hearted suicide attempt. So, yes: this is a movie in which\r\nJames Franco plays a white, male, mostly-self-tortured artist, coping with a\r\nmajor spiritual crisis. What could be worse?  In theory, I agree with you. And in practice, \u201cEvery Thing\r\nWill Be Fine\u201d wears a certain preciosity on its sleeve, starting with the\r\ntitle, with its deliberately broken \u201cEverything,\u201d oy. One might suspect The New\r\nSincerity in action, except that Wenders has always been a one-hundred percent\r\nsincere filmmaker, whether creating such acute stories of existential anxiety\r\nas \u201cThe American Friend,\u201d luminous, mysticism-laden parables of love like\r\n\u201cWings of Desire,\u201d or atrociously soft-headed meditations on being a man out of\r\ntime, as in his dire 2008 \u201cPalermo Shooting,\u201d his most recent fiction feature\r\nand not a particularly good omen for this one. \u201cEvery Thing Will Be Fine\u201d is in a very real sense\r\nthematically quaint, and too often the screenplay, by Bj\u00f8rn Olaf Johannessen, is\r\nspectacularly verbally maladroit, not to mention vague. \u201cNeither of us is fine \u2026 we want different\r\nthings in life \u2026 I just want to write \u2026\u00a0\u201d is the sort of thing the performers have\r\nto work with for the first half of the movie. As irritating as the commonplaces\r\nare, and as distractingly bad as the dialogue gets, glints and glimmers of\r\nperception and feeling find their way out from the 3D frame. Gainsbourg\u2019s\r\nsingle mom character, an illustrator, has a quiet, enigmatic dignity, and the\r\nscenes at the center of the film between her and Franco seem to want to take\r\nthe narrative in a more expansive direction, away from the commonplace\r\nsolipsism of Tomas\u2019 character, who by this point has moved on from Sara and\r\ninto a relationship with Maria Jos\u00e9e Croze\u2019s Ann, herself the mother of a young\r\ngirl. The narrative, as it happens, moves across a span of twelve years, and\r\ndoes go to some disturbing and unexpected places. Tomas\u2019 encounter with Sara\r\nmany years after the fact is satisfying in a way the filmmakers perhaps did not\r\nintend, but I can\u2019t be too confident about that.  And Franco actually does mostly alright by his possibly\r\nimpossible character. His inspired work in \u201cSpring Breakers\u201d notwithstanding,\r\nhe\u2019s been frittering away his credibility as a dramatic actor for some time, but given the lack of detail he\u2019s got to work with here, he\u2019s not a presence\r\nyou want to eye-roll off the screen. Although the point in the film at which\r\nhis performance needs to gather strength\u2014a tense kitchen-table confrontation\r\nwith another male near the end\u2014is exactly the point where he trots out his\r\nstoner squint-and-smirk; not really the right choice. Elsewhere he\u2019s\r\nfine, and particularly fine when his character is called upon to examine his\r\nown lack of affect.  Advertisement \u201cEvery Thing Will Be Fine\u201d is far from a perfect film. But\r\nWenders is trying to do new things within the confines of a pretty standard\r\nEuropean art-film scenario, and the viewer can see he\u2019s not approaching the\r\nmaterial as though it\u2019s rote; he\u2019s really trying to use the camera to get\r\nthrough the feelings of loss the characters suffer. Wenders is also the author\r\nof a book of essays called \u201cEmotion Pictures,\u201d and he once again brings some\r\nhonor to that concept with this flawed but intriguing work.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Permanent", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Every generation of girls has its aspirational hairstyle. I grew up on the tail-end of the Farrah Fawcett era, punctuated by Dorothy Hamill-mania and Princess Di-frenzy. My idol when I was 10 was Andrea McArdle, star of the Broadway show \"Annie,\" who had a bob cut with a little curl coming down either side of her face. My hair was too thin to replicate the look, even with the help of a curling iron. I was devastated. In an act of meaningless revenge, I cut off all my hair in an attempt to put the bouncy Dorothy Hamill-Andrea McArdle bob of my dreams firmly in the rear-view mirror. In \"Permanent,\" writer/director Colette Burson (creator of the HBO series \"Hung\") uses the premise of a Tween's bad haircut to explore\u2014to varying degrees of success\u2014issues of family, class, adolescence. Advertisement The year is 1982. Farrah Fawcett's hair still reigns. Young Aurelie (Kira McLean), who has moved with her parents to a Virginia suburb, stares longingly at the bouncing thick locks of the middle-school girls around her, and begs her parents (Patricia Arquette and Rainn Wilson) to let her get a \"permanent.\" Her whole life will be different\u2014especially in a new school where she knows no one\u2014if her hair had more \"body\"! But Aurelie's parents are openly broke, and the beauty salon trainee who administers Aurelie's perm leaves her looking like Little Orphan Annie with a finger in an electrical socket. The bullying she gets at school, already bad, ratchets up a notch. She gets in fights. All she needs to do is somehow come up with 60 bucks to get her hair straightened. She schemes and plans for a way to get that money. \"Permanent\" is filled with ineffectual narcissistic adults and children as cruel as Black Hats in a classic Western. Everyone mispronounces Aurelie's name (a teacher calls her \"Areola\" at one point). Jim, Aurelie's dad, was a steward on Air Force One, and proudly displays all of the signed photographs from U.S. presidents. He's going back to school, but stymied by his fear of swimming (long story). One look at the toupee glued onto his head makes it obvious where his daughter gets her hair insecurities. Jeanne, Aurelie's mother, is overworked and sexually frustrated (\"Jim!\" she pleads at one point, \"Sex is free!\"). Her main goal in life is to touch a dolphin and she's so furious when Jim doesn't show the appropriate interest that she sleeps on a blanket in the backyard. (Arquette and Wilson make a wonderful comedic team.) They are a family of misfit toys. Each person is afraid of everything, of change, of not belonging, of rejection. The trio freezes up when an unexpected knock comes on the front door. \"What is wrong with us that we're all afraid to open the door?\" moans Jeanne from her spot on the couch. The group family scenes are the best in the film. Aurelie befriends the straight-talking Lydia (Nena Daniels), who has been placed in remedial classes for no reason other than she is a black girl in a predominantly white school. A condescending teacher, speaking slowly, asks her to name a word starting with the sound \"sh.\" You can probably imagine Lydia's irritated reply. Lydia and Aurelie team up\u2014most memorably during a brutal scooter-hockey game in gym class, filmed like it's the World Cup\u2014to try to get back at the mean girls who torment their lives. Young Daniels, a Richmond native, has an Oscar-worthy moment late in the film during a school-wide poetry reading. The connections made in Burson's script between Aurelie's bad perm and Lydia's braided hair is not well-considered, especially when Lydia decides to unbraid her hair in a moment of shared freedom. \"Permanent\" is not substantial enough a story to be able to support a commentary on African-American girls and their hair. The film has a good comedic rhythm, and there's a rambunctious bickering energy in every scene. It's often quite funny. But \"Permanent\" feels like a short film stretched to feature length. It never quite rises above the level of its premise. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "In Transit", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"In Transit\" is a film about people riding a train from one place to another, talking about their lives with other passengers. That's all there is to it, and yet that's not all there is to it. The movie is a throwback to an earlier era of documentaries, when filmmakers did not feel obligated by commercial pressure to give their film the shape of a thriller, a sports film, a mystery or anything else, but instead simply brought their cameras into people's lives. The setting is the Empire Builder, an Amtrak train that journeys between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest, serving Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon as well as points in between; its route includes North Dakota, a new oil boom region that supplies many of this film's intriguing characters.\u00a0 Advertisement This film is nearly as welcome a breath of fresh air as my favorite film of 2016, Kirsten Johnson's \"Cameraperson,\" an autobiographical essay film made up of footage shot by a camerawoman over three decades, arranged in editing so that fragments of other people's lives explore universal concerns, such as war, trauma, childhood, parenting, illness, death, and the ethics of storytelling. \"In Transit\" is similarly supple and mysterious in the stories it tells and the points that it makes. And when it does make points, it never hammers them. It has a light touch, and many of the larger connections it draws are conveyed through editing, as when characters talk about the past that they left behind when starting over, and the movie cuts to a shot from the last car on the train, watching the rails recede into the distance. Considering that \"in Transit\" has no main character\u2014unless you count the train itself\u2014it is a remarkably coherent work. Clocking in at a brisk 75 minutes, it gives\u00a0us tantalizing glimpses into people's lives that suggest the totality of their experience while leaving us wanting more. This is my principal complaint about the movie\u2014it's a rare feature that might've benefited from a longer running time, because some of the characters' stories are interesting enough to linger on; at the very least, there are points where I wouldn't have minded if the filmmakers had stayed with one person for a couple minutes longer instead of cross-cutting between two or three stories.\u00a0 But the impulse to keep things moving relentlessly forward suits a film set on a train, and the people we do meet are consistently fascinating, even when we initially mistake them for merely eccentric or self-involved. We meet a mother and a daughter who bond by riding the rails, an immigrant woman who wants to see as much of her new country as possible, and a young man who's nervous about meeting a woman he courted from afar for many years. A very pregnant woman has a long conversation with an older man who keeps taking pictures through the windows, documenting his trip; we don't learn his story until much later, and it's so moving that I'd rather not spoil it here.  Advertisement \"In Transit\" is also a rare American film that gives us a sense of the richness of this country, both geographically and in terms of life experience. While the passenger manifest is predominantly white\u2014unsurprisingly, considering the states that the train is passing through\u2014there are passengers of many other races and ethnicities, as well as a variety of social classes, including many working class people who are either coming from oil fields or headed there. A series of scenes in the film's midsection lets us eavesdrop on a thirtysomething African-American man as he's counseled by a much older African-American man who knew Dr. Martin Luther King; their conversation focuses on optimism, ethics and the importance of love; its conclusion, a solo statement about life by the elder man, is one of the highlights of this moviegoing year.  As anybody who's familiar with public transit will attest, there's something about taking a long ride by yourself that encourages you to volunteer information you might not discuss with your own family. Passengers talk to the filmmakers and to each other about their relationship and marital troubles, their doubts about their career, their fear of aging, illness and death, and the difficulty of making a living in a supposed land of plenty. As the characters talk, mill about, eat, sleep, play cards and talk on the phone, the film crew's cameras frame them within an array of geometric spaces created by the rectangular shapes of windows and door frames, and track their progress from car to car, the overhead lighting panels and regimented rows of seats stretching into the distance in exaggerated perspective that makes the train seem a thousand miles long. The sound design is exceptional as well. There is no score to speak of, only snippets of pop songs that we hear briefly on passengers' phones, plus a bit of an old standard played (with merciful brevity) on a ukulele. After a while, the noises of the train itself become the binding element of the experience of watching \"In Transit\": the bell going ding-ding as the train goes into a station, the horn blowing as the train glides around corners or passes through towns.  No surprise that such an old-school project was masterminded by the late Albert Maysles (1926-2015). With his brother David (1931-1987), Maysles helped create \"Direct Cinema,\" an observational type of filmmaking that believed that the filmmaker should be as unobtrusive as possible, both in the room with subjects and later on when the footage is being edited. Maysles talked about \"In Transit\" for nearly two decades before this movie finally, posthumously appeared. It was originally envisioned as his pet project made of footage collected while riding trains: he would just take out his camera, interview people who were in the compartment with him, and then either keep going after they got off the train or disembark with them and see where they were going. I'm not sure how much footage he collected, but I'm told by people who worked with him that there was a lot. When I interviewed him for the Star-Ledger in 2000, he talked about and described some footage he'd already shot and made \"In Transit\" sound like the movie he'd been building up to throughout his long career. Advertisement This film is something else, though \u2014a collaboration between Maysles and co-directors Nelson Walker and Lynn True (who edited, brilliantly). None of the stuff Maysles shot over the years is in this movie: it's a one-shot project that attempts to realize his plan within a contained space and time span. The footage was shot by a team of camerapersons roaming about the train, plus a fixed camera that captured the landscapes rushing by outside. There is no indication of who shot what, though aficionados of Maysles' gently probing camerawork might have their suspicions.  All this makes \"In Transit\" a fascinating study in legacy as well as the gestalt of trains and the personalities of people who ride them. The characteristic Maysles mix of curiosity and compassion is present in every moment  of \"In Transit.\" It doesn't always feel like the films that Maysles made with and without his brother, but there are times when it does, strongly so, and there are other times when the Maysles touch is apparent even when the film is making choices that Maysles might not have made. And that's how Maysles would have wanted it, I suspect. In the second half of his life, he was as much a mentor as he was a filmmaker. Among its many virtues, \"In Transit\" is a moving tribute by students to a master who taught them how to see while encouraging their vision.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Lovers", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The first thing that really hits you about \u201cThe Lovers\u201d is not its muted color palette, ever-evocative of a smog-suffused Southern California dusk, but its musical score. A lush, romantic through line of melody, performed by a whole orchestra, with passages reminiscent of Ravel, Debussy, even Wagner. The score is by Mandy Hoffman, a longtime collaborator with this film\u2019s director, Azazel Jacobs. (There is a bit of authentic Tchaikovsky in the movie as well, and, near the end an unexpected but perfect 1980s pop hit.)  Advertisement Majestic, romantic, searching strains seem at first peculiarly incongruous with the action on screen. \u201cYou need to tell her now,\u201d an attractive middle-aged woman sitting on a bed tells a paunchy, balding, despondent-looking fellow some years older than her; his submissive response is rather less than zealous. Another couple, this one a woman in late middle age who\u2019s with a younger man, is then seen kissing by a tree near a nondescript office building; he, too, seems the more ardent one in the exchange. The older folks are Michael and Mary, played with incredible aplomb and discipline by Tracy Letts and Debra Winger. They are married, as it happens, to each other. They live in a bland split level house in a bland split level neighborhood, work bland undemanding jobs, and interact with each other with a tolerance that barely disguises, if at all, their jaw-clenched disregard for each other. Like most adulterers, they\u2019re reluctant to let the other shoe drop, or so it seems; by the same token, there\u2019s a sense they cannot wait to start new lives with their very whiny lovers. What they\u2019re waiting for, now, is a visit from their college-attending son, whom they want to tell in person. Of course neither is aware that the other is cheating.  So we believe. To tell the truth, there\u2019s a lot of ambiguity in this droll and stylized comedy \u2026 until the moment when there\u2019s no ambiguity at all. One morning, in the period when they\u2019re preparing for their son\u2019s visit, Michael and Mary go to sleep their customary way, sharing a bed but not touching. In fact they stay as far away from each other as a person in the same bed can get. But the next morning, they wake up facing each other, their heads almost touching. They open their eyes. They look at each other. They are terrified. But they decide to go off the cliff: they kiss. Then they make love. Then they\u2019re off to the races, having an affair with each other. This will eventually throw their son Joel (Tyler Ross), who has told his girlfriend Erin (Jessica Sula) how much his parents hate each other, for a major loop. But not before Michael and Mary have taken off for home during their lunch hours several times, and have left their peculiarly needy outside interests hanging at crucial moments.  There\u2019s one scene that\u2019s a particular riot. Michael is out with lover Lucy (Melora Walters), a dancer he\u2019s surprised at her ballet teaching class. He\u2019s eagerly explained to her about how much he wants to go out on a proper \u201cdate\u201d with her. First he has to make up a lie for the wife. Who is, of course, out with her whiny boyfriend Robert (Aidan Gillen). Each spouse asks about the background noise on the call, given that it\u2019s supposedly coming from the office where the spouse has to \u201cwork late.\u201d Michael spins a tale about how he stepped out for a bite; he\u2019s gone to get \u201cChinese.\u201d Mary lies back that she too has gone for \u201cChinese.\u201d Michael suggests that she do as he does and get \u201cthe duck.\u201d \u201cIf you ask me,\u201d Michael says, \u201cIt\u2019s too delicious not to share.\u201d The quality of their passion here is not just notable for its audacity but for its crassness; in their rediscovery of each other they\u2019re committing a kind of double betrayal. Which is what makes it fun for them, one suspects.  Advertisement But Jacobs\u2019 movie does not judge them, and, in fact, its myriad elements, including the music, suggest that it somehow believes in them, not in spite of their flawed character, but because of it. This is a picture with stylization that some will find off-putting, but the actors are totally in sync with it, and its through line is remarkably consistent. The languid pacing is not an arbitrary stylistic tic; it conveys a listlessness that is likely not uncommon to suburban life in Southern California. The movie\u2019s frankness about the physicality of adultery in late middle age will be much commented on, I suppose, but part of the point Jacobs seems to be making is that such things aren\u2019t worth making a big deal over. The wisdom of this meticulously crafted film is in its genuine irony, which amplifies steadily throughout until culminating in a moment of real heartbreak that, ironically enough, only sets the stage for a cycle of deceit to begin again.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Remote Area Medical", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "They drive for for hours through mountains and forests and line up days in advance, in the parking lot of Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee. They're not here to see a band or a race. They're here to see doctors and dentists who have volunteered for Remote Area Medical, a roving volunteer medical service that was founded by\u00a0Stan Brock in 1985\u00a0to help residents of the Amazon jungle. Things are as bad in the rural US as they were in thje rain forests of Brazil, where Brock once broke his leg and was informed that the nearest doctor was a 26-day journey on foot.\u00a0 Advertisement The would-be patients camped out in their cars on the outskirts of the speedway are in bad shape. They have sprains, broken bones, arthritis, skin problems. Many of them have such severe tooth decay that they can barely chew food anymore, and their significant others can no longer muster the nerve to kiss them. They haven't been to a doctor in months, years, ever. \"Have you been told before that you have a spot on your x-ray?\" a doctor asks a woman who's had her lungs photographed for the first time. \"I\u00a0never had an x-ray,\" she replies. Directed by Farihah Zaman and\u00a0Jeff Reichert\u2014a critic who writes for ReverseShot, where I've occasionally published articles\u2014\"Remote Area Medical\" is a rare contemporary documentary that is determined to tell by showing. There are no experts weighing in on the medical care crisis that's making the lives of working class and poor people measurably worse, nor are there any charts and graphs explaining how job with benefits that don't require college degrees have been drying up for decades, even as real wages fall in relation to inflation, and the cost of medical care continues to rise.\u00a0 The filmmakers get all this across by talking to people in the parking lot and inside the medical tents. A few of their subjects (including Brock) are affiliated with the organization, but most are patents, or friends and family of people who've come along to supper the patients as they wait and wait for treatment. And from these subjects, you find out all you need to know to appreciate the magnitude of what RAM is doing, and the scope of the crisis affecting the rural poor. \"We don't have jobs here, and the jobs that are available aren't paying living wages,\" one patient says. A woman tells us that her job pays so little that she regularly has to choose between paying for food, shelter or other expenses for herself and her kids\u2014a choice no person should have to make. A woman who just got a sebaceous cyst removed from her face poses for a picture with doctors, instinctively using a strand of hair to cover the spot where the cyst use to be (it's just a scar now, and she's happy to have it). She tells the filmmakers that she didn't attend her daughter's graduation because she didn't want her to be embarrassed by her mother's appearance. Another woman comes to the stadium hoping to have all of her rotting teeth pulled and replaced with dentures. She has to settle for having the five worst teeth yanked. Afterward, she weeps from shock and gratitude.\u00a0 Advertisement This is the America that the filmmakers are documenting\u2014one rarely presented in movies, and even more rarely presented without condescension.\u00a0 \"Remote Area Medical\" has a kind of artistry that might not be immediately apparent to viewers. It's of a sort last seen in the 1980s, in great theatrical documentaries shot on film, like Barbara Kopple's \"American Dream.\" Such movies upheld the traditional documentary ethos built up in the '60s, by pioneering nonfiction directors such as the Maysles brothers, D.A. Pennebaker, and Frederick Wiseman, artists who went to surprising places, interviewed or observed fascinating people, then went into the editing room and let an accumulation of data create a picture for us, rather than goosing their message with re-enactments, zippy music montages, ironically chosen bits of pop music, and storytelling devices borrowed from the world of scripted features.\u00a0 The movie's only problems are repetitiveness and length. There may not have been enough material here, dramatically speaking, to sustain a whole feature. While every individual subject is at least compelling, and some are riveting, their stories do tend to repeatedly illustrate the same points about the brokenness of the current system. The movie's focus on patients is admirable in the abstract, but after a while, you may wonder if more emphasis on doctors, nurses and organizers might have given \"Remote Area Medical\" more variety of tone or point-of-view. Nevertheless, this is an important story, elegantly told, sometimes harrowing, always affecting. There are images and people in it that you will never forget.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Moebius", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Kim Ki-Duk\u2019s \u201cMoebius,\u201d the follow-up to his Golden\r\nLion-winning \u201cPieta,\u201d takes many of the bizarre, incestuous beats of that drama\r\nand twists, contorts and morphs them into black comedy. Although many who read\r\neven the comparatively tame plot description that comes shortly in this review\r\nwill probably doubt the comedic undertones of the latest from the controversial\r\nKorean director. Trust me. Kim uses provocation through extreme imagery to\r\nsatirical ends. He wants you to squirm, be uncomfortable, and even laugh at the\r\ninsanity of what\u2019s happening on the screen. And, again, trust me, the word insanity is not an\r\nexaggeration in this case. Advertisement \u201cMoebius\u201d is a three-actor, four-character piece that plays\r\nlike Greek tragedy filtered through the lens of extreme filmmakers like Takashi\r\nMiike. As soon as one thinks that Kim has pushed the envelope narratively and\r\nvisually, he has something else disturbing up his bloody sleeve. The three\r\nentirely committed, fearless performers put through the physical and emotional\r\nmotions by Kim carry a film that is the definition of \u201cnot for everyone\u201d but \u201cMoebius\u201d\r\nworks on its terms. Its twisted, Oedipal, sadomasochistic, castrated terms. A man (Jae-hyeon Jo) is having an affair. A mother (Eun-woo\r\nLee, who also plays the mistress) knows about the affair and she\u2019s cracking in\r\nevery possible way. She confronts her husband and attempts to castrate him. She\r\nfails. So she castrates her son (Young-ju Seo) and flees the home. The father\r\nfeels such grief over his son\u2019s castration for his own sins that he becomes\r\nobsessed with trying to find ways for the young man to achieve sexual release.\r\nHis journey into the kind of Google searches that the authorities sometimes\r\ntrack results in the discovery that some people get off by rubbing stones on\r\ntheir skin until they bleed while others who have been castrated have found\r\nrelease by having knives shoved in their back and twisted around. Did I\r\nmention that dad's mistress becomes the object of sexual obsession of the son?\r\nCareful readers will note that the mistress and mother being played by the same\r\nwoman is not thematically coincidental. And then dear old crazy mom comes home\r\nand things get REALLY weird. Did I mention all of this is conveyed without a single line\r\nof dialogue? Kim\u2019s film is not a silent one a la \u201cThe Artist\u201d but a film in\r\nwhich the characters simply never speak. Oh, they make a variety of other\r\nnoises, most of them guttural. It almost feels like Kim was trying to see how\r\nmuch human suffering a filmmaker could convey without the crutch of dialogue to\r\ndo so. And so we hear groans, moans, cries, and every other sound one can\r\nimagine that doesn\u2019t include actual pronunciation.  The decision to craft \u201cMoebius\u201d as a dialogue-free piece has\r\na dual impact. First, it heightens viewer involvement as we have to lean\r\nforward, concentrate heavily on the blocking and staging to follow a story that\r\nhas no subtitles or other traditional sign markers. Second, it creates an\r\nexaggerated world like a theatrical piece that chooses movement or\r\ninterpretative dance, for example, to convey its themes instead of narrative.\r\nAnd that element adds to the black comedy aspect of \u201cMoebius\u201d\u2014this is inherently\r\nridiculous but it\u2019s made more so by no one commenting in any way through\r\ndialogue on that ridiculousness. Advertisement To say the performers in \u201cMoebius\u201d are fearless, especially\r\nEun-woo Lee, would be understating it significantly. Kim asks an amazing\r\nphysical and emotional freedom of his actors and they all deliver. We can sit\r\nback and appreciate Kim\u2019s daring work as a commentary on the way modern society\r\ndeals with sexuality, infidelity and insanity but one shouldn\u2019t ignore the very\r\npractical nature of what\u2019s happening onscreen in some of the darker moments you\u2019ll\r\nsee in a cinema this year. Kim, like a lot of great shock artists, creates a\r\nwork so intentionally button-pushing and maniacally over-the-top that it\r\ndemands your attention. He may be one of the international cinema scene's most\r\ndivisive filmmakers but no one can argue that he\u2019s going through the motions or\r\nfailing to explore the function of his demented form.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Extraordinary Tales", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda\u2019s \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d is an animated anthology\r\nfilm of Edgar Allan Poe stories narrated by luminaries like Christopher Lee,\r\nGuillermo Del Toro and even Bela Lugosi himself (using old audio footage). To\r\nbe blunt, it\u2019s kind of difficult to mess that up too much. Christopher Lee\r\nreading Edgar Allan Poe? Sign me up. Both the source material and the man\r\nreading it are legendary. And that inherent cool factor in \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d\r\ncarries the final product a very long way, although its shortcomings do\r\nsometimes force me to wonder if it could have been a masterpiece instead of a\r\nmere curiosity. As is, a few decisions made by Garc\u00eda in the filmmaking process\r\nhold \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d back from its true potential, although if it\r\nintroduces filmgoers to the works of Poe (or Lee or Lugosi, for that matter),\r\nit\u2019s done some good. Advertisement Garc\u00eda and his team animate each short film in very\r\ndifferent styles, coming back to a wraparound conversation between a raven and\r\na statue in a cemetery between shorts. It starts with the amazing \u201cThe Fall of\r\nthe House of Usher,\u201d read by Christopher Lee. The animation is surprisingly\r\nflat, looking often like a last-generation video game with too much CGI, when\r\nhand-drawn would have given this atmospheric piece more punch. However, it\u2019s\r\neasy to appreciate the budgetary freedom that animation gives Garc\u00eda with \u201cUsher,\" as\r\nthe house falls apart in a way that would have cost a studio $80 million were\r\nit live-action. In many ways, the second short story chosen is Poe\u2019s most\r\npopular and the most interestingly conceived within \u201cExtraordinary Tales.\u201d A\r\nhighly-truncated (they all are, and sometimes frustratingly so) version of \u201cThe\r\nTell-Tale Heart\u201d is told by a scratchy audio of the one-and-only Bela Lugosi,\r\naccompanied by starkly vivid animation in sharp blacks and blinding whites that\u2019s\r\nmeant to invoke famous comic artist Alberto Breccia. As a standalone piece,\r\ndespite the edits to the source, this is a fascinating bit of cinema in that it captures influences from around the world, bringing Lugosi, Poe, and Breccia\r\nunder one twisted tent.  \u201cThe Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\u201d (narrated by Julian\r\nSands), \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum\u201d (narrated by Guillermo Del Toro) and \u201cThe\r\nMasque of Red Death\u201d aren\u2019t as effective, especially the final one, which may\r\nbe the strongest visually but eschews all narration and has almost no dialogue\r\nto tell this tale only with images. I\u2019m not sure taking away the film\u2019s\r\ngreatest asset\u2014Poe\u2019s way with words\u2014was the smartest way to end the piece.  And that\u2019s a feeling I had a few too many times in \u201cExtraordinary\r\nTales\u201d\u2014wondering why Garc\u00eda made a certain visual choice, or why he cut a\r\ncertain part of Poe\u2019s stories while focusing on another (the whole thing only\r\nruns 73 minutes, when it would have benefitted by being twice as long and\r\nletting Poe\u2019s brilliance linger before jumping on to the next piece). Again,\r\nPoe\u2019s storytelling gift is so timeless, and the voice actors assembled so\r\ncaptivating, that \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d can\u2019t help but work on some level.

{"Title": "21 Years: Richard Linklater", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Matthew McConaughey stole Richard Linklater's second feature, \"Dazed and Confused,\" with his performance as the eternal high school stud Wooderson, so it makes a certain sense that he'd steal the documentary \"21 Years: Richard Linklater,\" a feature-length look at the director's movies that's disproportionately focused on \"Dazed.\" Ruminating on the Austin-based writer-director's oeuvre, McConaughey improvises monologues with an infectious grin, and uses his hands like a preacher or motivational speaker. The documentary runs 78 minutes, at least 15 minutes of which concern \"Dazed\"; the recent Oscar and Emmy winner tucks them into his back pocket like a tin of snuff. If nothing else, McConaughey's goofball autodidact's intensity certifies that there is, in fact, a \"Matthew McConaughey\" type of character, and that McConaughey originated it. Advertisement \"Boom! We go to set, I get my '70s Chevelle,\" the actor says, remembering the film's 1992 production in Austin, Texas. \"It's gonna be my first scene in the movie, and I'm going, 'Fuuuuuuck, here we go!', and I'm really nervous, I'm going, 'Who am, I what am I about, what's my man, what's my man, what's my man, what's my man,' and I remember in my head hearing Wooderson's voice going: 'All right, I'm about pot, rock 'n' roll, my car, and p----y.' Well, I'm high, I'm in my Chevelle, I'm listening to Nugent, and I heard 'action.'\" Later, in a section describing Linklater's calm, reflective demeanor, McConaughey says he once told the director, \"You're so Buddhist you don't even know you're Buddhist.\" Directed by Michael Dunaway and Tara Wood, \"21 Years\" does not cover every Linklater film, just highlights that keep popping up whenever the director's films are discussed. These include \"Dazed\"; \"Slacker\"; the experimental animated features \"Waking Life\" and \"A Scanner Darkly\"; \"School of Rock\"; \"Bernie\" and\u00a0\"The Newton Boys\" (in which McConaughey costarred); the remake of \"The Bad News Bears\"; and the \"Before\" films. The latter, a collaboration between Linklater and actor-writers Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, is described as the lowest grossing trilogy in cinema history. (That might or might not be true, but it's fun to say.) There's nothing about Linklater's secret magnum opus \"Boyhood,\" which was still under wraps during the filming of this documentary and is referred to only as \"the 12 year project.\" Delpy, Hawke, Jack Black, Keanu Reeves, Billy Bob Thornton and other Linklater performers talk about Linklater's film shoots, and try to illustrate his personality and interests; the filmmakers insist on illustrating their anecdotes with animated cutaways that feel redundant and sometimes desperate. (Surely Matthew McConaughey's charisma is enough to hold our attention for a minute or two, without \"help\"?)\u00a0 Linklater does not sit for any interviews. He is an absent presence. In one way, this is endearing: it suggests that Linklater either didn't want to seem self-aggrandizing, or didn't want to seem to be guiding anyone else's interpretations, including the viewers'.\u00a0But in another way, it hurts the film, because the other participants (mostly actors) lavish praise on Linklater without analyzing the technique or themes of his movies in much detail. The most insightful comments about Linklater as an artist, cultural observer, and community organizer come from Austin Chronicle founder Louis Black. He had a cameo in \"Slacker\" and has known Linklater for years, but\u00a0seems to have a\u00a0more detached point-of-view than the actors who've worked with the director at least once, and would presumably like\u00a0to again.\u00a0 Advertisement The 'tribute to an old pal\" structure makes \"21 Years\" feel less like a yeasty stand-alone theatrical feature than a shaggy dog supplement that might be packaged in a set of Linklater DVDs, or screened at a surprise birthday party for the filmmaker. It contains just enough analysis to interest those outside Linklater's personal circle, but not much more.\u00a0Interviewees wax eloquent about Linklater's fascination with subcultures and what it's like to work with him, paying special attention to his laid-back way of controlling and directing action, and his ability to help actors find the notes he wishes to them strike without being too obvious about it. If you admire Linklater, you'll enjoy this documentary, but an \"American Masters\" episode would still be preferable.

{"Title": "The Frozen Ground", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Anchorage, Alaska, circa 1983, looks and feels like a pioneer town in the Wild West in \"The Frozen Ground,\" Scott Walker's new crime thriller (and first feature). It's a town teeming with strip clubs, drug addiction, prostitution, and runaway girls whom nobody would miss if they went missing. And they do go missing, in droves. Based on the true story of Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen (played here by John Cusack), and detective Glenn Flothe (named, in the film, Jack Holcombe, and played by Nicolas Cage) who, in investigating a series of missing persons reports as well as a couple of dead girls dug up by animals out in the wilderness, starts to wonder if all of these events aren't somehow connected.  Advertisement \"The Frozen Ground\" trucks in cliche, as most serial killer and police procedural films do, but the strength of the acting (from the leads down to people with only one or two lines) helps ground the film. Filmed in a frenetic style, with gigantic moving frenzied closeups, and an almost total lack of establishing shots, \"The Frozen Ground\" is best when it lands, and stays, on the faces of the leads: Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, and Vanessa Hudgens.  When we are looking at their faces, we don't need to be reminded of the stakes.  They're there in plain view. It's hard to do something new in the serial killer genre, especially since the field is so over-saturated, from the 24/7 Investigation Discovery channel to \"Criminal Minds\"'s weekly obsession with how dangerous it is to be a woman because one minute you're walking down the street, minding your own business, the next minute you're chained up in a dungeon. All of those familiar elements are here. Jack Holcombe even has a resentful wife (Radha Mitchell), complaining to her husband about how hard he works, before doing an unmotivated about-face in a later scene. Why do movies so rarely know what to do with wives of workaholics?  Why are they usually given the role of nag, before coming around in the final hour?\u00a0 But \"The Frozen Ground\" is not trying to re-invent the wheel, and it also isn't trying to imitate \"Seven\" or \"Silence of the Lambs.\" It is interested in Holcombe's increasingly urgent investigation, and the pushback he receives from higher-ups who don't want to re-open what were considered to be closed cases. There's one shot of Nicolas Cage sitting in a dark office, staring up at a bulletin board, covered with snapshots of missing women. That one shot establishes so much: his feeling of urgency, the sense of how huge this thing could be if anyone could find the missing links, and the loneliness of his quest.  Advertisement Robert Hansen's name may not be as well-known as Ted Bundy, or John Wayne Gacy, but his murderous spree in 1970s and 1980s Alaska puts him in the Serial Killer Pantheon. Despite a troubled and violent background with tons of red flags, Hansen was able to maneuver undetected in Anchorage for many years, abducting young women, raping them, taking them via private plane out into the inaccessible wilderness surrounding Anchorage and then hunting them like game. He was married, with kids.  He worked as a baker.  People liked him, but he was quiet and kept to himself. He had a great cover persona, as most of these characters do.  Flothe finally got a warrant to search Hansen's house, and found an aviation map covered with X's, to mark the spot of his burial grounds.  Many of the victims were never found.  We'll never know the number of women he actually killed.  Hansen was sentenced to 461 years in prison with no possibility of parole.  Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens) is the teenage prostitute who managed to escape from Hansen's clutches, and went to the police to tell her story.  She was not believed, because of her background.  This is handled in a manner bordering on vaudeville, with one cop regaling a group of cops with the contemptuous comment, \"I mean, how can a prostitute be raped?\" They all laugh in agreement.  This is not to say that such situations do not happen in police stations all the time, but the scene feels heavy-handed. The scenes between Nicolas Cage and Vanessa Hudgens are the film's best.  Nicolas Cage is so grounded here, so real and simple. The whole film really hinges on Holcombe trying to make Cindy trust him so that she will testify and be a reliable witness, and this is where Cage shines. His entire performance is about two things only: thinking and listening. He has a power of listening that is totally authentic, and he is quite generous to his young co-star. He is not concerned with himself, because Jack Holcombe isn't either. He listens to Cindy talk on a level that could be described as subterranean, with a cop's instinct for what isn't being said. Advertisement And Cindy is, to put it mildly, a handful. She has a pimp (played by 50 Cent, who also is one of the producers of the film), but things have gone south in that relationship. She wanders up and down the \"Ho Stroll\" in Anchorage, and gets a job dancing in a strip club. She does coke and crystal meth.  She has nowhere to live, and stands on the sidewalk in the driving snow. (There is a breathtaking scene that has nothing to do with anything else, where Cindy, alone on a deserted side street, comes across a gigantic moose, which has wandered into the city. Moose and Cindy stand for a while, staring at each other. The snow falls. It is a moment that is beyond meaning, beyond plot, reminiscent of the encounter with the deer on the railroad tracks at dawn in \"Stand By Me.\") John Cusack dials the burner down low, a smart choice, giving the character the guy-next-door persona which was so much a part of Hansen's successful M.O. When we see him in the flashbacks, with one of the girls he abducted (Gia Mantegna, in a gut-wrenching performance), he is calm, almost taciturn, even when he punches her in the head. He's almost kind and supportive with his victims, telling them they are \"good girls.\" Cusack has placed his voice at a very interesting part of his register, making him sound (and seem) benign. It's a voice that almost isn't there. He is a hunter, a predator. He has worked hard at his camouflage. Mixed in with the super fast hand-held action of the majority of the film are periodic aerial shots (Patrick Murguia is the cinematographer) of the forbidding Alaskan wilderness, mountains, glaciers, frozen rivers. These shots are constant reminders of what a vast field Hansen had to play in, and the impossibility of ever finding the missing.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Self/less", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Filmmakers have struggled with the definition of what it\r\nmeans to be a human being for decades. Are you merely a product of flesh and\r\nbone? Do you believe there\u2019s a soul? Or is your mind the most definitive aspect\r\nof your existence? From Rod Serling to \u201cSeconds\u201d to silly body switch movies\r\nlike \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the consideration of the human body as a shell, one that\r\ncan house a persona other than your own, has fascinated some of our most\r\ncreative voices. And when it was announced that a visually striking and\r\nphilosophically ambitious filmmaker like Tarsem Singh (\u201cThe Fall\u201d) was going to\r\nwade into these waters himself, there was reason for notable optimism. Which\r\nmakes the result, \u201cSelf/less,\u201d all the more frustrating. \"Self/less\" is a bland, generic\r\nproduct that almost defiantly refuses to explore the complex issues which it\r\nraises, perhaps in an effort to appeal to a wider audience. The narrative outline\r\nof \u201cSelf/less\u201d is a philosophical theme park, readymade for daring, complex\r\nfilmmaking. And Singh and his writers never go on any of the rides. Advertisement Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is an uber-wealthy New York\r\nbusinessman, the kind who appears to have chosen to cover his entire, lavish\r\napartment in gold one day, simply because he was bored. Sadly, all the wealth\r\nin the world cannot defeat the cancer that\u2019s killing him, nor can it reunite a\r\nbitter man with an estranged daughter (Michelle Dockery). Hale receives a\r\nmysterious business card that promises him a future that his body cannot. He\r\nmeets with an obviously nefarious scientist/CEO named Albright (Matthew Goode),\r\nwho tells Hale about \u201cshedding,\u201d a process that allows someone to discard their\r\nbroken body for a new, genetically grown one, for a cost of only $250 million.\r\nHale signs up. After going through a visually dull process (and here\u2019s\r\nwhere you start to wonder why Tarsem didn\u2019t make different aesthetic choices,\r\nand not for the last time), Hale wakes up in the body of Ryan Reynolds. He\u2019s\r\ngiven a new name\u2014Edward\u2014and relocated to New Orleans, where life appears to be\r\nexactly what he wanted. He drives a fast car, plays basketball, and even makes\r\na new friend (Derek Luke). The one hitch is that Edward has to take a little\r\nred pill at the same time every day or risk hallucinations, migraines and even\r\ndeath. After missing just one pill, Edward has a detailed hallucination that\r\nfeels more like a flashback, and discovers that this body was not grown in a\r\nlab. It belonged to a family man who sacrificed himself to pay for treatments\r\nto save his daughter\u2019s life. He finds Edward\u2019s family, including an\r\nexpectedly-startled wife played by Natalie Martinez, and learns the truth about\r\nhis new life, a truth that Albright and his suited cronies will do anything to\r\nkeep secret. Clearly, this is thematically dense stuff, from the way the 1% uses\r\nthe desperate needs of the poor to their own advantage to a reliance on\r\npharmaceuticals to stay happy and alive. Yet every time \u201cSelf/less\u201d feels\r\nlike it\u2019s going to actually explore one of those themes and give them more than\r\nlip service as plot details, it pulls back to standard, genre fare, both narratively and visually. \u201cSelf/less\u201d\r\nis one of those depressing affairs that gets less and less interesting as it\r\nprogresses. The opening scenes of opulence in Hale\u2019s penthouse have a strong\r\nvisual aesthetic\u2014empty rooms like empty minds waiting to be filled\u2014but that\r\ndisappears in the seemingly neverending second act, during which \u201cSelf/less\u201d\r\nsags and never recovers, feeling at times more like a failed cable TV pilot than a film. With its hallucinations, questions of identity, and philosophical\r\nresonance, it\u2019s simply inexplicable that \u201cSelf/less\u201d becomes as visually\r\nengaging as a \u201cCSI\u201d spin-off. Perhaps Tarsem was reined in by producers who\r\ndidn\u2019t want their \u201cRyan Reynolds Vehicle\u201d to become \u201cArtsy,\u201d but they made a\r\nfatal error. At 116 minutes, and with a narrative that telegraphs every twist a\r\nhalf-hour before it arrives, \u201cSelf/less\u201d needed a visual language that it just\r\ndoesn\u2019t have. Advertisement And that lack of personality isn\u2019t replaced by anything.\r\nReynolds isn\u2019t bad but he seems to have been directed to play Edward just a\r\ntick north of bland, which isn\u2019t exactly his strong suit. Someone here needed\r\nto realize that a movie this conceptually crazy needed to be fun. Movies like \u201cFace/Off\u201d\r\nare enjoyably ridiculous in large part due to the fact that Nicolas Cage, John\r\nTravolta and John Woo KNEW they were ridiculous, laughing and winking at the\r\naudience throughout. \u201cSelf/less\u201d is played on a straight line, never nearly as\r\nmuch fun as it could or should have been.

{"Title": "Baywatch", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "If you\u2019re like me, you laughed at the trailers for \u201cBaywatch,\u201d the feature-film comedy sendup of/homage to the cheesy lifeguarding adventure TV series. That show featured quasi-hunk David Hasselhoff and bodacious babe Pamela Anderson plucking bodies from water and solving crimes, something that was not really their bailiwick\u2014a point that this movie at first pokes fun at, and then belabors into unfunniness. But let me not get ahead of myself.  The trailers were funny enough to make me look forward to the picture. Imagine my displeasure when confronted with the nearly two-hour full feature, in which the trailer jokes were no longer funny; a full feature with a storyline that an enterprising six-year-old might have thought was a little too rudimentary. (The fact that the storyline was concocted by Thomas Lennon and David Ben Garant, the hipster hacks who have in fact written a book about how to make big dollars in Hollywood by writing utter crap screenplays, could be said to add insult to injury were both injury and insult not totally predictable.)  Advertisement How is it, you might ask, that the trailer jokes are funnier than what is in the movie? Well at least one joke from the trailer isn\u2019t in the movie. And as for the rest, the answer lies in the fact that this is another one of those raunchy comedies that\u2019s barely a movie, that looks like it was edited by dumping a bunch of footage into whatever movie-cutting software they\u2019re using and hitting \u201crandomize.\u201d The number of out-of-continuity shots in the first 20 minutes was so large I stopped counting.  The movie begins with Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Mitch Buchannon, head lifeguard of Baywatch, running around his beach, reaffirming his supremacy. Tryouts for positions on his team are tomorrow, and today a few of the new recruits introduce themselves. One is Ronnie (Jon Bass), the tubby, nerdy tech guy with a thing for always-running-in-slo-mo Baywatch hottie CJ (Kelly Rohrbach). His thing is such that it causes him some physical discomfort in a long, drawn-out, unfunny \u201cstuck junk\u201d bit half adapted from \u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary.\u201d Another candidate is Alexandra Daddario\u2019s Summer, who will be the slo-mo brunette to CJ\u2019s blonde. (Ilfenesh Hadera is Stephanie, the most authoritative female of the crew.) The guy who headquarters says must be included is disgraced Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (Zac Efron), who\u2019s getting on the crew in a combination of publicity stunt and community service. Mitch is not too happy about this. His name-calling of Matt (which does include the sobriquet \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d) is one of the few running bits that manage to raise a smile.  After all the characters are introduced, we cut to the next day\u2019s tryouts, at which Ronnie and Summer prove their mettle, and Matt goes head-to-head with Mitch. And after this scene, the movie injects an \u201care you looking at my boobs\u201d exchange between Summer and Matt, in which the characters are wearing the costumes they had on in their introductory scenes taking place the day before. As they used to say on \u201cMystery Science Theater 3000,\u201d \u201cThey just didn\u2019t care.\u201d  Which may still have you asking, how does this affect the jokes? Well, in the trailer there\u2019s one isolated bit in which Efron\u2019s character stands gloating on a yacht deck, saying \u201cJason Bourne ain\u2019t got nothing on me.\u201d Only he doesn\u2019t get to the last word, because a bad guy behind him knocks him out. Funny in the trailer, because it\u2019s cut to hit on a certain beat, and it does. In the movie, they use a completely different take of the line and the shot\u2014it\u2019s a tighter perspective from a low angle, with a little anamorphic distortion\u2014and there\u2019s no breathing room before Efron makes his proclamation, so the line falls flat.  Advertisement It kind of goes that way throughout the movie. Which also features long periods of too-sincere homilies about teamwork, weirdly gratuitous brutality (one innocuous character is subjected to a grotesquely grisly death) and an extended corpse-penis joke which, in the dishonorable tradition of \u201cDirty Grandpa,\u201d subjects a character played by Zac Efron to humiliation in a way that\u2019s not even stealthily homophobic. On the plus side, the movie has a pervading air of crass amiability about it\u2014it\u2019s almost like a two-hour end-credits gag reel. (Nevertheless, it contains an end credits gag reel.) But as I said, if you saw the trailer, you got the best the movie has to offer.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Breathe", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Teenage girls yearn to connect. It's an impulse that is so strong that if one is left outside the charmed circle of belonging the whole world can fall apart. It's like being banished from a very powerful cult. Who you are depends on how you are perceived. Betrayal and manipulation, occurring beneath parental notice, is savage. M\u00e9lanie Laurent's second feature, \"Breathe,\" based on a popular YA novel, understands the addictive sensations of a new friendship, its thrilling swing into merging, and its dizzying plunge into hurt and rage. It's a confident and scary film. Advertisement When Sarah (Lou de La\u00e2ge) first appears in school, she carries with her the self-aware glamour of the \"new girl.\" She ingratiates herself immediately with everyone in school by whispering the correct answer to a kid stumped at the blackboard in math class. She smokes cigarettes from Nigeria and talks about her mother who works for an NGO in Africa. In gym class, she leaps onto the balance beam, standing suspended in the air, with one leg stretched out behind her, a vision of stillness and self-confidence. In the pack-mentality of high school, Sarah is an individual. It's seductive. Shy asthmatic Charlie (Jos\u00e9phine Japy) is thrilled when Sarah seems to choose hervas a best friend. Charlie's home life is upsetting. Her parents (Isabelle Carr\u00e9 and Radivoje Bukvicon) are so engrossed in breaking up, getting back together and then breaking up again, that they barely pay her any attention. Charlie and Sarah spend hours on the phone together, sneaking cigarettes in the school bathroom, going out dancing, their involvement so hermetically sealed that it is as though no one exists on the planet but the two of them. There are danger signs early on. Sarah, with a breezy air of plausible deniability, drives a wedge between Charlie and her childhood friend Victoire (Roxane Duran). Watch how she does it during a scene when the three of them walk home from school. You almost can't catch her at it. Then, on a weekend trip with Charlie's family, Sarah pursues the guy interested in Charlie's mother. There's something ruthless about it. De La\u00e2ge is riveting all around, but is most compelling in those moments when she is not the center of attention. She goes entirely flat, waiting, waiting for the spotlight to turn her way again. Once the equilibrium is destabilized, Charlie starts to flail. Instead of backing off, she clings. Both have something the other wants. The gaps in personality, confidence, circumstance, are filled by the all-encompassing presence of the other.\u00a0 Advertisement The film takes off once the honeymoon period is over. The real strength of \"Breathe\" is in the fact that Sarah is not villainized, although her behavior is often monstrous. Of course, she has secrets: her breezy conversation about her awesome selfless mother would be clocked by an FBI profiler as nonsense in about 2 seconds. Perhaps her lies are a survival mechanism. She eventually experiences Charlie's interest in her as intrusive, even though she had courted Charlie like a \"mark\" from the get-go.\u00a0 Details interest Laurent as a director: the silences, the body language, the collage-aspect to teenage life (classes, homework, parents, parties, phone calls). Events are presented in isolated images: Charlie playing knock-hockey with friends; whispering on the phone with Sarah; Sarah and Charlie wandering through a field the air golden and peaceful. The story is linear (unlike the book, which is told in flashback), but the style is fragmentary, deceptively casual. There are a couple of stand-out shots, the most stunning being a long tracking-shot along the exterior of a building, where we see Sarah's home life through the windows as the camera passes by. Charlie's rage at being left out of Sarah's warm glow has resulted in stalker-like behavior, and that shot is a disturbing representation of it.\u00a0 Japy, at first, seems to have the more cliched wallflower role. But there are details in the performance that show us otherwise: her deadpan expression as she approaches her unhappy home, the sense that rage is there in her, rage she has no idea how to handle. Being rejected by Sarah doesn't exactly bring out an \"I won't be ignored, Dan\" reaction, but it's close. She wants answers: Why is she \"out\" now? What did she do? Self-loathing is irresistible. de La\u00e2ge shows a masterful understanding of a fragile girl who has created a persona that works for her, helps her navigate. She is narcissistic and depends on the attention of others. She's brutal, but she can also be vulnerable, supportive and fun. Advertisement Watching events unfold is almost a despairing experience, bringing up feelings of \"Why can't they work it out?\", with the corollary being \"Why can't girls stop doing this to each other?\" Margaret Atwood's novel \"Cat's Eye\"\u00a0is one of the most accurate portrayals of the viciousness of little girls, viciousness that is invisible to authority figures, and \"Breathe\" is in that pantheon. Women look at one another and know the score. The response can be one of empathy (\"Oh my God, you do that too?\") or it can be one of rejection (\"You're like that, but I'm NOT.\") Sarah's cutting observations on Charlie's behavior have truth in them, hurtful though they may be. Charlie does need to let it go. But Sarah gave her something she wanted, belonging, importance. She wants it back. The fact that Sarah has played her like a violin is incomprehensible to Charlie.\u00a0 Cinema is filled with stories of intense and manipulative female friendships, friendships that sometimes tip over into folie a deux situations like \"Heavenly Creatures\" or \"Don't Deliver Us From Evil\". Women will stab you in the back. Women will steal your husband. Women will start gossip campaigns to destroy your reputation. Laurent knows all that, but never lets her story derail into cliche. This is well-observed stuff, the hysteria of a new friendship, and the moments when the abyss opens up, yawning underneath what once seemed perfect.", "Critic": "Alpha"}

Three young men rent a hotel room with the sole purpose of bringing back women for sex, which they would record and turn into amateur porn. One of their targets, a shy girl named Lily, turns out to be a winged creature who rips their genitals off and murders them. Classic horror movie lessons: don\u2019t be an asshole and don\u2019t underestimate the quiet girl. Expanded into a full-length feature in this week\u2019s \u201cSiREN,\u201d any such message is muddled by a script that has no idea what it\u2019s saying or doing, and a director who can\u2019t grasp the right tone. The centerpiece of \u201cSiREN\u201d needs to be a descent into Hell that the filmmakers here seem incapable of really taking, resulting in a film that\u2019s totally strange in concept but rather straightforward in execution. It's a movie lost somewhere in the middle: too weird to be believable, not weird enough to be memorable. Advertisement Jonah (Chase Williamson) is getting married and it\u2019s that time in a young man\u2019s life when the bachelor party becomes a pressing concern. His brother has been put in charge of trying to plan the most memorable evening possible, which appears to include booze, strippers and shrooms. However, it looks like the night is going to be a bust when they end up at a hole-in-the-wall strip club that produces more sadness than ecstasy. Just as they\u2019re about to call it a night, a mysterious stranger offers to take them to a private establishment, the likes of which they\u2019ve only heard about in urban legends. Of course, while the boys are excited at the prospect of finding the orgy house from \u201cEyes Wide Shut,\u201d horror movie viewers know something more akin to \u201cHostel\u201d or \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d is on the night\u2019s schedule. The centerpiece of \u201cSiREN\u201d is, of course, at the underground strip club, which quickly reveals itself to have a supernatural side. Sure, the bodyguards in masks are creepy enough, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the strippers with scales or the live torture show happening in the corner of the room. And wait until the establishment\u2019s proprietor Mr. Nyx (Justin Welborn) gets you backstage, where things get really weird. Mr. Nyx is a collector of the odd and the supernatural, including a young lady named Lily (Hannah Fierman), who is behind glass like so many adult performer establishments. But this is more to protect the client than the stripper. And Lily doesn\u2019t so much dance for our groom-to-be as she sings, a siren song of course, that enchants him in such a way that he decides he must save Lily, convinced she\u2019s being sexually trafficked. He sets her free, and she begins a night of carnage, spurred on by the fact that she\u2019s now in love with Jonah. Yes, \u201cSiREN\u201d could be read as a cautionary tale against freeing sexual prisoners, but let\u2019s not get into that. There are times when \u201cSiREN\u201d approaches the WTF insanity it needs throughout in order to work. There\u2019s a sequence shortly after Lily\u2019s escape in which the boys, realizing that she is a genital-ripping creature of the night, try to flee the club, and it\u2019s borderline inept in its construction but hints at the movie this could have been, more of a tongue-in-cheek journey to the dark side than the filmmakers seem capable of delivering. As is, \u201cSiREN\u201d just isn\u2019t odd enough. It\u2019s a movie about implanted memories, a stripper with a tail, and winged creatures, but it doesn\u2019t have the personality to make any of that interesting, despite game performances from Welborn and Fierman.  I guess the moral of the story is if you\u2019re going to make a weird movie, go all in. Don\u2019t hesitate. Don\u2019t hold back. Horror movie watchers will take the journey with you. Despite its inherent ridiculousness and winged title character, \u201cSiREN\u201d never gets off the ground. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "By Sidney Lumet", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Sidney Lumet made 44 films in 50 years. That kind of prodigious output would be impressive even if he was merely turning out for-hire studio work, but any film buff worth a conversation knows that\u2019s not the case with Lumet, who not only made films for five decades but made films that mattered. Famous for a social conscience reflected in films like \u201c12 Angry Men,\u201d \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d and \u201cRunning on Empty,\u201d Lumet was also a consummate \u201cactor\u2019s director\u201d and an underrated craftsman. I was honored to be asked to appear on the Director\u2019s Club podcast earlier this year in an episode devoted to the man, which allowed for a marathon of rewatches of a dozen or so of Lumet\u2019s films, and the scope of his talent remains breathtaking, from his first film to his last. So how could a movie possibly capture that vast of a career in only 100 minutes? Nancy Buirski\u2019s \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d is a gift to fans of the art of film directing. It is beautifully constructed, not as a chronological biography of a directorial legend but as a thematic exploration of his work. Comprised mostly of an interview conducted just a few years before his death, \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d won\u2019t just make you want to revisit his works but reappreciate the role of a great director in cinema. Advertisement Given the breadth of his accomplishments, it may come as a surprise how often a very humble Lumet speaks of luck. He recognizes how much of his best work came about because of the right contributions from the right people at the right time. All art has a degree of blessed coincidence, and it\u2019s surprising how much Lumet begins the film discussing this element of his career, such as when he was tapped to direct \u201c12 Angry Men.\u201d He also speaks at length about his upbringing in Yiddish theater, and a strict father, who was also an actor. Buirski works thematically in the construction of her film\u2014for example, she\u2019ll go from a story about Lumet\u2019s father to a scene from \u201cDaniel\u201d or \u201cRunning on Empty,\u201d illustrating how Lumet\u2019s life experience influenced his filmography. By avoiding the so-typical construction of chronological biography, Buirski gets at something much deeper: the \u201cchapter\u201d of Lumet\u2019s life about his father didn\u2019t end when his dad passed but was reflected throughout his career, all the way to the dynamic between Philip Seymour Hoffman and Albert Finney in \u201cBefore the Devil Knows You\u2019re Dead.\u201d  \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d doesn\u2019t skimp on technical or filmmaking anecdotes as well. One of my favorite films of all time, \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d sparks a discussion of color palettes, and how he purposefully didn\u2019t use one in that movie to keep it as realistic as possible. As he says, the worst-case scenario would be for the audience to not identify with Al Pacino\u2019s character because he was gay, so he had to ground the film as realistically as possible visually to amplify the commonality. To that end, there was no costume design. Everyone wore their own clothes. Buirski also doesn\u2019t shy away from showing extended clips, including a scene with Pacino to serve as an example of the truth of his performance, one of my favorites of all time. Clearly, I\u2019m a Lumet fan, so here\u2019s where I have to step back and wonder if \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d would work for those who aren\u2019t. While the thematic assembly is invigorating for those of us who know his career and biography chronologically, it may be off-putting or even frustrating for more casual fans. And sometimes it does feel like the balance can be slightly out of whack. It\u2019s well over an hour before we get to anything related to \u201cNetwork,\u201d \u201cPrince of the City\u201d or \u201cThe Verdict,\u201d and one could easily do a full documentary on those three films alone. For non-Lumet fans, it may be too much of one thing. For Lumet fans, it may be not enough of his best work. It\u2019s impossible to capture every facet of a career as vast and influential as Lumet\u2019s in one interview documentary, and I would argue that Buirski isn\u2019t really trying to do that. She doesn\u2019t speak to collaborators of Lumet\u2019s or those influenced by him. This is not that film. It is a conversation, one of the last of its type, with a master filmmaker. Personally, I wish we had more of them. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}

From the beginning, \u201cThe World of Kanako\u201d is designed in a\r\nway to be unsettling. The opening scenes with close-ups of sweaty faces\r\nspurting lines like \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d set the dual themes of\r\nthe piece\u2014love and violence\u2014but they do so in a way that\u2019s discomforting.\r\nThere\u2019s a sense of displacement and confusion, especially for the first act,\r\nthat\u2019s not unlike a late night in a club. You barely hear snippets of\r\nconversation over the loud music, and Fujishima and editor Yoshiyuki Koike don\u2019t\r\nhold a shot for more than a few seconds. Even scenes of dialogue between two\r\nrelatively normal characters\u2014like when Fujishima is talking to Kanako\u2019s\r\nclassmates or her doctor\u2014are cut together from several angles.  Advertisement At first, Fujishima feels just like a straightforward anti-hero,\r\nthe bad cop trying to do one last good thing, but that interpretation changes\r\nrelatively quickly. He\u2019s not a hero. He\u2019s the kind of guy who, while staying\r\nwith her to help find his daughter, rapes and beats his ex-wife. He picks up a\r\nhooker who he drunkenly calls his daughter\u2019s name. Yakusho is fearless, playing\r\nmost of the film hunched over, bloody and sweaty like a man who has literally\r\ntaken himself to the brink of death and no longer cares what happens to him. It\u2019s\r\nsuch a daring performance that it makes the violence of the piece more visceral\r\nbecause we believe this man is capable of surviving anything and doing anything\r\nto get his daughter back. There\u2019s a parking garage shoot-out/stab-out that\r\nneeds to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s \u201cOldboy\u201d-claw-hammer-scene insane. Admittedly, I grew tired of the nihilism of \u201cThe World of\r\nKanako\u201d long before it was over, and I have a high tolerance for that sort of\r\nthing, so that has to be taken into account when assessing the overall product,\r\nbut the quality of the filmmaking never flags. You just have to ask yourself if\r\nthe journey to this ridiculously violent world, however well-constructed, is one worth taking.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Goodbye to All That", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The southern-based playwright and screenwriter Angus Maclachlan makes his film\u00a0directorial debut with this disarming sex comedy about a fellow named Otto whose\u00a0hapless inattention to certain salient details of his existence leads to the breakup of his\u00a0marriage. Otto, played with sly charm and vulnerability by Paul Schneider, is so in the\u00a0moment that he tends to discount how a given moment might do some damage, as when\u00a0he crushes his foot tooling around in a dune buggy with his nine-year-old daughter.\u00a0Later on, that daughter, Edie (Audrey P. Scott, who\u2019s wonderful), tells her mom Annie\u00a0(Melanie Lynskey), how she\u2019s been praying for her dad, because she \u201cwants God to be\u00a0nice to him.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement Annie doesn\u2019t feel like being super-nice to him; soon, with the help of a very take-charge\u00a0therapist, Annie informs Otto that \u201cthe marriage is over\u201d and Otto is soon out on his own.\u00a0Upon learning of the affair that prompted Annie\u2019s action, Otto returns to the dating pool\u00a0and is both bemused and frustrated to learn that love interests both old and new, played\u00a0by an array of attractive actresses that go from Heather Graham to Anna Camp to Ashley\u00a0Hinshaw to Heather Lawless, are largely interested in falling into bed with him and not\u00a0much else.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of good awkward fun to be had as the viewer simultaneously laughs\u00a0at Otto\u2019s expense and hopefully commiserates a bit with him. Particularly hilarious\u00a0and cringeworthy is a scene of a nude sit between Otto and young, lissome Mildred\u00a0(Hinshaw), who\u2019s very into chat prior to sexual activity. \u201cI like that you have calluses on\u00a0the palms of your hands,\u201d Mildred coos to Otto, and the look on Schneider\u2019s face as he\u00a0regards his distinctly un-callused palms (the guy works as a web designer, for heaven\u2019s\u00a0sake) is priceless. The movie is replete with little eccentric touches of behavior, dialogue\u00a0and performance. It\u2019s in a totally different register than the two prior Maclachlan\u00a0pictures I\u2019ve seen, the affectionate and quirky Southern family drama \u201cJunebug\u201d (2005,\u00a0directed by Phil Morrison) and the intense spiritual allegory \u201cStone\u201d (2010, directed\u00a0by John Curran). There\u2019s almost a sense of male wish-fulfillment in the parade of truly\u00a0luminous women who come into Otto\u2019s life, but this makes the humor of their subsequent\u00a0eccentricities that much more potent, as in Camp\u2019s sexual super-freak who, after an\u00a0intense bout with both Otto and a sex toy quietly avers \u201cI wanna read my Bible.\u201d\u00a0 Otto\u00a0and Maclachlan seem to embody the same attitude towards women: affection and nearly\u00a0awe-filled respect combined with a certain amused exasperation. It\u2019s slightly ironic that\u00a0by then end of this concise film\u2019s story arc, the most ostensibly sane of Otto\u2019s romances\u00a0makes him the most outlandish proposition, to which Otto replies: \u201cCan I?\u201d Whether he\u00a0can and whether he does is addressed in the movie\u2019s coda, and movie lovers looking for\u00a0an unusual, quirky, regionally sensitive (autumn in North Carolina has never looked more\u00a0appealing in a film) will enjoy taking the brisk, entertaining journey to the place of Otto\u2019s\u00a0resolution.

{"Title": "The Girl and Death", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"The Girl and Death\" is a pretty blunt title, and an evocative one as well, recalling as it does, you know, that Schubert string quartet \"Death and The Maiden.\" Although this movie\u2019s music is mostly Chopin, with a little Gounod. Dutch director Jos Stelling, who also co-wrote the picture, knows how to prepare his audience, I guess. His movie is as somber, and redolent of Old Europe, as its title seems to promise. It is also as, for lack of a better or happier word, conventional.Meticulously conceived, handsomely shot (by Goert Giltay), sincerely enacted by an able and largely attractive cast, \"The Girl and Death\" is also the sort of movie in which one character will say \"Love destroys everything; love is an illusion\" to another character mere seconds after the two characters are introduced. The movie begins some time in an unspecified past, as an old distinguished man with a volume of Pushkin visits an abandoned hotel; it flashes back to his first visit there. He is Nikolai, a Russian on his way to Leipzig to make his fortune, and upon stopping in for the night he finds himself enchanted by young Elise, who is one of several courtesans who inhabit the premises. Nina, the \"love is an illusion\" chippie, tries to warn off poor Nik, who is soon subjected not just to the torment of love but to the humiliations of the hateful, old, fake nobleman who \"owns\" and abuses Elise. The two star-crossed lovers make sacrifices for each other that, alas, the other in each case can not be privy to; the misunderstandings arising from these circumstances create a very unpleasant scene after Nikolai returns from his successful fortune hunting to give the fake nobleman what for. And so on. These plot twists and turns do recall the narrative poetry of Pushkin, whose rakes were raked over the coals by fate, but Stelling seems uninterested in aspiring to the wit that animated Pushkin\u2019s irony; his vision is pure mordancy only leavened by a wispy romanticism that recalls the likes of \"Elvira Madigan.\" In this respect, leading lady Sylvia Hoeks, delicate-featured and with a strong screen presence, provides the movie with much-needed oomph. But it\u2019s not enough to rescue the movie from its own complacency. \"The Girl And Death\" seems entirely resigned in its depiction of a world in which men of wealth and power trade in human souls for sexual satisfaction, and younger men rage at the injustice of it all until they acquire their own wealth and power and become as blind and petty as those they once despised. It soaks in its depression as if in a warm bath. Movies made over fifty years ago by the likes of Max Ophuls were more animated, more angry, more radical in their critiques of such injustice. So watch \"Letter From An Unknown Woman\" before you even think of checking this out, is my advice to you.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Prince Avalanche", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Prince Avalanche\" is the perfect end to a long summer of computer-generated spectaculars, a film in which there are only two special effects: natural beauty and human emotion.\u00a0 The beauty comes from the setting: a section of landscape near Bastrop, Texas, that was scorched by wildfire. The emotion comes from the film's main characters, Alvin (Paul Rudd) and his brother-in-law Lance (Emile Hirsch), who've been hired to repair land and roads. They paint yellow lanes on blacktop, mulch\u00a0gardens consumed by flame, and inspect ruined homes. They kid each other as men do, keeping it light when they aren't sniping at each other.\u00a0 Advertisement These early scenes are pleasant yet tense because we know what sort of movie this is\u2014a male bonding drama that must eventually erupt into pained confrontation. When the confrontations arrive, though, the pain doesn't feel like an obligatory story beat, because we've grown to know and love these characters.\u00a0 At first this seems very much a mentor-pupil sort of relationship, with Rudd's Alvin as the steady, smart, capable family man, and Hirsch's Lance as the city kid who can't stand being out in nature for longer than a few hours.\u00a0The film's writer and director David Gordon Green adapted this movie from the 2011 Icelandic drama \"Either Way,\" and there's a touch of European style intimate-splendor to it. Swaths of flaming trees evoke the opening montage of \"Apocalypse Now.\" There are images of burros grazing on wildflowers, a bird pinwheeling above a line of trees, a green caterpillar inching over the top of a mossy log, yellow paint spilling into a stony riverbed, and so forth. The original score, by Explosions in the Sky, creates a trancelike feel, occasionally pushing too hard, to the point where it feels as though you're watching the dollar-store version of \"Koyaanisquatsi.\"\u00a0 But most of the picture has a contemplative, at times deliberately pokey groove. There may in fact not be quite enough story to support a feature\u2014Green told RogerEbert.com's Simon Abrams that the shooting script ran about 65 pages\u2014but this is clearly not one of those films that loses sleep over whether every second is propulsive. In fact a large part of its worth lies in how opposed it is to the values that modern commercial films tend to prize.\u00a0 This is the sort of movie that lets its two main characters spend their first few screen minutes waking up from an overnight camp, trudging uphill towards pink dawn light with shovels on their shoulders, laying yellow paint-lines on pavement, and so forth, while saying barely a word. The film reveals character through nonverbal details of gesture, framing and production design (such as when the paint-striper rolls out of frame, followed by Lance's road-crew-inappropriate brown suede shoes).\u00a0 There's banter about the men's \"equal time boombox agreement\" and chatter that reveals backstory. We get the sense that Alvin's out here not in spite of his home situation, but because of it, and that Lance is neither the freewheeling stud nor the lazy lout that Alvin seems to think he is. Lance knows things about Alvin's wife (Lance's sister) that are better left unspoken, not because they reflect poorly on her, but because addressing them might puncture Alvin's image of himself. Lance has his own blind spots. His constant droning about his pickup artistry is annoying, then pathetic, then oddly charming, because it clearly doesn't match up with who he actually is. (When he tells Alvin he's going to try his luck at a beauty pageant because he's got \"like, an eighty to ninety percent success rate at those places,\" Alvin replies, \"Somehow, in your mind, you truly do perceive yourself as a gentleman.\") Advertisement The movie made me think of one of my favorite films of the '90s, one not many people have seen: Tom Gilroy's \"Spring Forward,\" starring Liev Schrieber as a young ex-con and Ned Beatty as an older man who works in Connecticut state parks with him. Like that picture, \"Prince Avalanche\" feels like a stage play transplanted to the screen\u2014there are only three major characters, the third of whom is an old truck driver (Lance LeGault) who periodically hangs out with them\u2014and it tries to balance matter-of-fact exposition with quasi-mythological meanings. It's the sort of film in which \"We've got a lot of lines to paint, and it's a very long road\" is clearly about more than it seems to be about. For the most part, though, \"Prince Avalanche\" doesn't push its subtext too hard, even near the end, when it becomes clear that the men are out here to repair personal as well as geographical damage. \"Prince Avalanche\" represents a partial return to roots for its writer and director. Green's first three films\u2014\"George Washington,\" \"All the Real Girls\" and \"Undertow\"\u2014were models of American art-house ingenuity, drawing heavily the work of Terrence Malick, Werner Herzog and other filmmakers who like to explore natural beauty, human psychology, and the relationship between them. Then Green took a seemingly bizarre turn into goofball stoner-bro comedies: \"Pineapple Express\" and \"Your Highness.\"\u00a0But as Christy Lemire points out in her profile of Green, this wasn't a case of a filmmaker abandoning his gifts to make something commercial: the two modes represented different aspects of Green's interest. One of the many fascinating things about \"Prince Avalanche\" is how it merges those two types of films with understated grace.\u00a0 The bickering and manly preening and childish yet hurtful insults, the farting and scratching and other base gestures, and the expertly staged physical comedy (some of which seems to have been improvised) have that '80s comedy feel that Green loves. But the picture's vibe is pure arthouse visionary, channelling Herzog, Malick and the dramas that Gus van Sant made in the aughts (particularly \"Gerry\").\u00a0 Green displays a similarly adventurous yet kind spirit here. The most powerful scene is one of the subtlest: Alvin talking to a woman named Joyce Payne, whose home was destroyed by the blaze. Payne is a real-life fire survivor, and that was actually her house. Green and the crew met her during filmmaking and thought it would be nice to work her into the movie.\u00a0\"This is your house,\" Alvin says. \"Was,\" she corrects him. \"Everything's past tense now.\" \u00a0She tells him she used to be a pilot, and wonders how \"anybody's gonna prove that I had all these experiences, and flying.\" She tells him he's looking for her pilot's license. \"Do you think it burned up?\" Alvin says. \"I guess so,\" she replies.\u00a0 Alvin goes into an adjacent ruin and walks around. He pretends it's a functioning house with people in it, and that perhaps his wife is there and is glad to see him. It's an impressive bit of Chaplin-eseque pantomime by Rudd, who's a revelation in this film, but there's more going on here than a bravura display. Something deep is roiling within this man, something he can't let out. We live in our illusions. We don't want to leave them.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "24 Days", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Playing cat and mouse with kidnappers can be a grisly and\r\nawful business even if\u00ad\u2014or maybe the phrase should be \u201cparticularly if\u201d\u2014the\r\nkidnappers are dumb as dirt. That\u2019s one of the takeaways of \u201c24 Days,\u201d a\r\nwell-engineered suspense drama from France directed by Alexandre Arcady. The\r\nmovie, starring Zabou Breitman, Jacque Gamblin, Pascal Elb\u00e9, Sylvie Testud, and\r\nTony Harrisson, has a more upsetting dimension than most suspense dramas as\r\nit\u2019s based on a true story, a story that touches on issues still roiling France\r\ntoday.  Advertisement The movie begins with Breitman, in the role of Ruth Halimi,\r\ndirectly addressing the camera, and asking, \u201cHow could this happen in France in\r\n2006?\u201d The kidnapping of Halimi\u2019s son, Ilan, is what happened to begin with.\r\nArcady shows Ilan\u2019s family preparing for a group meal and going into loud shock\r\non learning of Ilan\u2019s abduction; particularly searing is the photo of Ilan with\r\nhis eyes and mouth duct-taped, with a gun to his head. Ruth and her ex-husband\r\nDidier (Elb\u00e9) go to the police. The head of the investigation, Delcour\r\n(Gamblin), is competent and highly invested, as is his crew, as is the\r\npsychologist/negotiation expert Brigitte Farrell (Testud) who works with Didier\r\non the phone calls from the ransom-demander whose name they don\u2019t know yet. His\r\nminions, underclass kids of all ethnicities, know him as \u201cDjango,\u201d and they\r\ndon\u2019t dare cross him.\u00a0 But Django, whose real name is Fofana, and who shuttles\r\nbetween Paris and his ancestral home of the Ivory Coast of Africa, isn\u2019t quite\r\nas much of a mastermind as he conceives himself. His original scheme was to\r\nkidnap a Jew, a strategy borne not so much out of race hate per se (although\r\nit\u2019s there) as a conviction that, good grief, \u201cJews have all the money.\u201d Not\r\nonly do they have all the money, but also they stick together and bail out\r\ntheir own. As it happens none of the Halimis are rich, or even particularly\r\naffluent. But Fofana\u2019s accomplices are pretty dim, and pretty sadistic. And as\r\nthe captivity drags on, Ruth is reminded of the case of Daniel Pearl. When\r\nFofana taunts the victim\u2019s parents with a reading from the Koran, it\u2019s a\r\nparticularly sick-making moment.  Arcady\u2019s direction is tight and efficient throughout (the\r\nsecond unit was handled by Alexandre Aja, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Arcady\u2014his son,\r\nto be precise\u2014who\u2019s made an, um, interesting career in American horror\r\npictures) and overstated at times, although by Hollywood standard his modes of\r\noverstatement (slow motion shots of characters turning around as they make\r\nsudden terrifying realizations, and so on) are almost subtle! But his handling\r\nof the story\u2019s very ugly twists and turns, particularly as the appalling Fofana\r\ngrows more truculent in his demands, is unimpeachable. As for its social\r\nanalysis, it\u2019s tough for non-residents of France to judge it. It\u2019s pretty clear\r\nthat the film falls squarely on the side of Ruth, who campaigned for the\r\nauthorities to acknowledge that anti-Semitism was at least an aggravating\r\nfactor in the case. And of course anti-Semitism is a French cultural issue\r\ngoing back to even before the Dreyfus case. These days the country has\r\nimmigration, so-called radical Islam, and other factors in this mix.\u00a0 Advertisement The finale\r\nof the movie could arguably be said to offload the anti-Semitism concern onto a\r\nnon-French-born person of color, which may strike some social-justice-sensitive\r\ntypes as\u2026what\u2019s the word?...\u201dproblematic.\u201d Sometimes the problem with finding\r\nthings \u201cproblematic\u201d is the fact staring you in the face: Fofana the individual\r\ndid, as it happened, do all the awful things of which he was accused. His last\r\nwords in the film are \u201cF**k France, bitches,\u201d which, yes, in the context of\r\nthis presentation are pretty \u201con the nose.\u201d On the other hand, it sounds like\r\nsomething the real-life Fofana would actually say.

{"Title": "After Earth", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"After Earth\" is a lovely surprise. This film from producer-costar Will Smith and director M. Night Shyamalan, about a father and son marooned on a hostile future earth, is a moral tale disguised as a sci-fi blockbuster. It's no classic, but it's a special movie: spectacular and wise. Smith plays a veteran space soldier with the metaphorically overripe name of Cypher Raige. The actor's real-life son Jaden (\"The Karate Kid,\" \"The Pursuit of Happyness\") plays Cypher's son Kitai, an aspiring warrior who just failed his cadet promotion test. The script, cowritten by Shyamalan and Gary Whitta, lays out a futureworld in brisk brushstrokes. Humans have fled a polluted Earth and built cities on the distant Nova Prime. Unfortunately, the planet was already claimed by another species that didn't take kindly to the colonists and created predators to kill them. The predators are called ursas. They look a like huge versions of Mike from \"Monsters, Inc.,\" only dipped in acid and slime and outfitted with razor fangs and pincers. They hunt by smelling fear. Advertisement The humans of Nova Prime fought the ursas to a draw, but one of them still killed Kitai's sister during a home invasion when the boy was younger. The kid has a survivor's guilt, and his dad feels horrible for being away on assignment when the nightmare happened. On top of all this, Cypher's a bit of a Cypher: a warrior known for his ability to \"ghost,\" slang for fighting without fear, but very much a ramrod-straight man-of-few-words type, so emotionally constipated that he seems to have to remind himself what laughter sounds like. Kitai is the eager young space cadet trying to embody and exceed his father's example, craving expressions of approval and love that his pop's not wired to provide. I realize I've described the main characters as if we spend the first hour eavesdropping on them in therapy. \"After Earth\" isn't like that. It's a stoic film about stoic characters fighting for their lives. The Raiges' ship is damaged in a freak asteroid storm, tossed out of hyperspace and into Earth's orbit, skims across the atmosphere like a pie plate, and is torn in two. Cypher and Kitai are the only survivors from the front half. Their distress beacon has been destroyed in the crash. The ship's back half, which might or might not contain a working distress beacon, is 100 kilometers away. If the castaways don't call for help soon, they'll asphyxiate or get eaten by predators, one of which is an ursa that was cargo on their ship, set free by the crash. Cypher's legs are broken. Kitai has to make the journey for him. He only has his trusty \"cutlass\" (a retractable double-bladed weapon), and an environmental suit containing basic supplies and a video-audio system that can let his father guide him from afar. Most of the film's dialogue is goal-related:\u00a0Go here. Try this. No dad, that won't work, I should try something else.\u00a0The film tells its story as Cypher or Kitai might. Each scene lasts as long as it should, and no longer. The camera moves with a purpose: to follow and frame and explain action, conceal or reveal surprises, and deepen the relationship between the characters and their world. Advertisement This is the right movie at the right time for Shyamalan. He usually writes, directs and acts in his own features. His control-freak tendencies magnify both his merits (spooky atmosphere, cunningly staged shocks, virtuoso camerawork) and his flaws (contrived \"twist\" endings, sub-Spielberg sentimentality, geeky fake-profundity). After the critical and box office misfires of \"The Village,\" \"Lady in the Water,\" \"The Happening\" and \"The Last Airbender,\" some thought he was finished as an A-list filmmaker. His talent was still there, but it was hard to see it behind all that ego. His pop mojo was as wrecked as Cypher's starship. Shyamalan didn't originate this project. He rewrote a script based on a story by Smith, who read a magazine piece about a father and son surviving after a plane crash, re-imagined it as a space fantasy, and hired Shyamalan to direct. So he's a gun-for-hire on \"After Earth\" \u2014 but clearly not a disinterested one. The M. Night vibe is subdued here, but you can still feel it \u2014 particularly in the wide shots of Kitai scrambling along forest floors and up mountain peaks, and in the scenes of Cypher talking his son across treacherous land, their tightly-framed faces answering each other through editing, and sometimes seeming to meld into one organism with shared consciousness. In the film's lyrical final act, the two seem as spiritually attuned as E.T. and Elliott. The movie's world is nearly as CGI-enhanced as the title world of \"Avatar,\" but it feels more real. It's not a special effects theme park with a new slobbering space beast behind every tree trunk, but a fully imagined ecosystem, a tapestry of flora and fauna. Fern fronds curl in icy night air. Flocks of birds form patterns in the sky. Carnivorous baboons, great cats, wild pigs, snakes and condors move like real animals, and react to threats with intelligence as well as force. Some of Shyamalan's images echo classic movie tales of survival and madness in nature: \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Searchers,\" \"The Naked Prey,\" \"The Edge.\" Advertisement \"After Earth\" is ultimately too thin of a story to support all of its grandiose embellishments, but so what? It's better to try to pack every moment with beauty and feeling than to shrug and smirk. The film takes the characters and their feelings seriously, and lets its actors give strong, simple performances. The younger Smith is a great male ingenue character, unaffected and kindhearted and free of vanity. The elder Smith stows the Bel Air badass shtick that makes many of his star performances tedious and gives a restrained, very physical performance, letting subtle vocal tremors and shifts in body language hint at the worries that the father hides from his son. In scenes that frame Will Smith's watery eyes and battered, crewcut head in close-up, the star evokes the middle-aged Burt Lancaster: a monument to machismo, worn down by pain and time. The father teaches lessons to the son, and the son to the father. As the poster says, danger is real, but fear is a choice. You can become the master of an event, the creator of a moment, even if it seems overwhelming, if you've absorbed the wisdom of people who lived through similar tests and told you how they survived them. And yet no lessons are universally helpful, no rules ironclad. Sometimes you have to disobey orders, even if they come from a commanding officer who gave you half of your DNA. Parent and child must ultimately separate because it's the only way to re-create themselves as equals. On some level both characters know this, even though it makes them sad. All this sounds corny by current standards. But by current standards, Aesop's fables and Bible stories are corny, too. \"After Earth\" carries itself with confidence because it knows what it wants to say, and how to say it. The asteroid storm appears suddenly, as if willed into being by Poseidon stirring a cauldron with his trident. The design of the spaceship would make Odysseus feel at home: the ribs of its hull seem to be made of wood and bone. The skyscrapers on Nova Prime are built from triangular wedges that suggest a schooner's sails. The warriors fight with blades. Ursa is Latin for bear. Kitai's leap from a high cliff is a leap of faith. His name is Japanese for \"hope.\" This movie is a fable. Fables teach. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Southwest of Salem: The Story of the San Antonio Four", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"[The San Antonio Four] case represents the last gasp of the Satanic Ritual Abuse panic.\" The quote comes from Debbie Nathan, an interview subject in Deborah S. Esquenazi's documentary \"Southwest of Salem.\" The documentary details the case of the \"San Antonio Four,\" where four Latina lesbians were accused in 1994 of gang-raping two little girls. The trials followed a couple of years later, and none of the women took plea bargains; all maintained their innocence and all were given lengthy prison sentences. Debbie Nathan co-wrote a book in 1995 debunking SRA (\"Satanic ritual abuse\"), that bizarre hysteria that swept the nation in the 1980s, a hysteria which got serious coverage in the news at the time (as though it was a real thing), and impacted law enforcement procedures, childcare and pediatric institutions, as well as therapeutic practices like \"recovered memories,\" designed to help children \"recover\" memories of their abuse. The \"San Antonio Four\" did not receive much (if any) national media coverage. Esquenazi became interested in the case years ago, and reached out to Debbie Nathan, who had also been a researcher and interview subject in Andrew Jarecki's 2003 documentary \"Capturing the Friedmans,\" another case that erupted out of the SRA panic. \"Southwest of Salem,\" featuring prison interviews with all four women, is an urgent and often infuriating documentary about the San Antonio Four's quest for justice and exoneration, a quest that remains ongoing. Advertisement Anna Vasquez, Cassandra Rivera, Kristie Mayhugh and Elizabeth Ramirez all came from strict Catholic homes, and grew up in a conservative Texas environment. \"Coming out\" was stepping into an unknown world, with perhaps terrifying consequences. Anna Vasquez came out to her mother when she was still in high school. Her mother went to talk to her priest about it and asked him what she should do about her daughter. He said, essentially, \"Love her.\" And so she did. Some of the other girls didn't have it so lucky. They were thrown out of their homes, disowned. Anna and Cassie, a young woman with two children, fell in love. Kristie and Elizabeth made up the larger posse, and the women were friends, helping one another, being there for one another. For years all was well, until one day, after taking care of two of Elizabeth's young nieces, the four women were accused of sexual assault. There was no physical evidence that a crime had taken place. Although the four women insisted that nothing had happened, in an environment of hysteria, homophobia and credulity, they didn't stand a chance. There was sketchy evidence from a pediatrician (debunked later), as well as the testimony of the two little girls, testimony that sounded fantastical, beggaring belief. Elizabeth's brother-in-law, Javier Limon, father to the two accusers, had been pursuing Elizabeth romantically, and was angry that she rejected his advances. Couldn't it be possible that he had coerced his children to make up a story so he could \"get even\" with the woman who dared to prefer women over him? But there wasn't a lot of critical thinking going on, and\u2014understandably\u2014nobody wants to disbelieve children when they make an accusation like that. The womens' homosexuality was used against them in their trials, and the news coverage was quite literally hysterical: the women were clearly witches, the children were \u201csacrificed on the altar of lust\u201d (an actual headline). Esquenazi presents all of this complicated information in a straightforward and compelling way, using local news footage, home movie footage, and prison interviews with the four co-defendants. Anna is the main interview subject, and she can still barely speak of what happened without weeping. Elizabeth is devastated that her nieces, whom she took care of all the time, would betray her, but she knew they had been coached by her vindictive brother-in-law. Anna refused to go into the Sex Offender program in prison, jeopardizing her possibility of parole, and causing her to lose any prison privileges she might have gained. Esquenazi also interviews the sheriff, the Mayor, the lawyers, many of whom betray their prejudices right to the camera, seemingly not realizing that they are doing so. The one unsatisfying interview is with Javier, who claims that nothing Elizabeth says is true. As more and more information comes out, one wishes that Esquenazi would return to that interview, ask some tougher questions, push him to go deeper, explain himself. What is his relationship like with his daughters, the original accusers, now? There are many unanswered questions. Advertisement The \"San Antonio Four\" do not have the brand-name recognition of the West Memphis Three although the cases share a lot of similarities. Viewers may get flashbacks to Joe Berlinger's \"Paradise Lost\" documentary series, another case\u2014occurring at the same moment in time\u2014borne out of the Satanic Ritual Abuse panic where innocent people, perceived as \"different\" by the communities in which they lived, were accused and convicted of horrible crimes. Despite the lack of media attention, the San Antonio Four caught the eye of a researcher who lives in the Yukon Territory, of all places. He was outraged by what he saw and began a campaign to get their cases re-opened. This was how Debbie Nathan got involved, and that eventually led to the famed Innocence Project (the Lubbock chapter) becoming interested in a re-investigation of the evidence. One of the accusers, now in her 20s, re-canted her original story, saying she and her sister had been coached by their father and their grandmother on what to say. The four women want complete exoneration. They do not want to have to register as sex offenders when they are released. They want the record wiped clean. Similar to the first and second installments of \"Paradise Lost,\" \"Southwest of Salem\" is a story that has not found its ending yet. Like Truman Capote, waiting to see what would happen to murderers Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, for months, years, knowing he needed some definitive outcome in order to finish his book \"In Cold Blood,\" Esquenazi has watched and waited and filmed, following the course of the case. Her documentary footage represents years of work, and it's an extremely impressive archive (a shoutout must be given to the talented editors, Leah Marino and Liz Perlman). \"Southwest of Salem\" has an investigative questioning bent, but it is always clear in its attitudes about the four co-defendants. It is a powerful act of advocacy. It's hard to look at these events in any light other than that a terrible miscarriage of justice has taken place.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Burnt", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Food porn, no matter how expertly and attractively presented, is no substitute for actual food. But if you are susceptible to the blandishments of food porn, \u201cBurnt,\u201d a new Bradley-Cooper-starring drama about a brilliant-but-troubled chef looking for a shot at redemption, might leave you hungry for a meal you\u2019ll possibly be hard-pressed to afford.\u00a0Money-wise, and maybe existentially.\u00a0 \n Heavy on beautifully-lit tight shots of blue burner flames, immaculate china plates, various foams, glazes, char marks, roots, zests, and all other manner of mouth-watering visuals for discriminating gourmands (the consultant on kitchen matters was pioneering chef Mario Batali, a bonafide kitchen genius), \u201cBurnt\u201d concentrates on the fashionable high-end of gastronomy. Cooper\u2019s character, Adam Jones recounts in voice-over that he\u2019s been doing penance for unspecified sins by shucking oysters in New Orleans \u2026 and, once he\u2019s gotten to one million, boom, suddenly he\u2019s in London, making snide comments to hotel restaurant ma\u00eetre d' Daniel Br\u00fchl about the mediocre quality of his fare. Adam isn\u2019t just in-person trolling fancy joints in this big, you\u2019ll excuse the word, foodie town. No, Br\u00fchl\u2019s Tony shares a past with Adam. Although London\u2019s a big town, the fact that Adam can\u2019t turn a corner without running into someone from his past makes the place seem like one of the backstage areas depicted in the recent Steve Jobs movie. Why, here\u2019s Omar Sy\u2019s Michel, who Adam pranked most heinously in Paris back in the day. And here\u2019s Uma Thurman\u2019s Simone, a restaurant critic Adam once dallied with against her better judgment, not just because Adam\u2019s a bad egg, but because Simone herself is a lesbian (that\u2019s JUST how much of a bad egg Adam really is). Adam also meets, and alienates, a few newbies: Sam Keeley\u2019s eager young chef cadet David, upon whose couch Adam imposes, and single-mom sous-chef Helene, who is a single-mom sous-chef played by Sienna Miller, so take a wild guess.\u00a0 Advertisement \n \u201cBurnt\u201d is yet another redemption story of the Destructive Genius, whom the audience is supposed to be compelled to like in spite of himself, and who begins his journey with a list of things he\u2019s not supposed to indulge in (in this case\u2014surprise\u2014it\u2019s booze, drugs, and women). Then, the narrative bends circumstances to allow the Destructive Genius to get at least one of those things (take a guess\u2026could it be a\u2026single mom sous-chef?) and pull off a triumph, also in spite of himself, but with the assistance of a Crucial Teachable Moment.\u00a0 \n \"Ugh,\" one might say, and one might have a point. One doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s better or worse that the whole scenario is polished with the sheen that I once called the Weinstein Tradition of Quality, back around the time of \u201cThe Cider House Rules,\u201d I think. Miramax Films may no longer exist, but under their Weinstein Company rubric, Harvey and Bob Weinstein continue to make, albeit with somewhat less frequency than they used to, Miramax-y product. Miramax-y product did/does have its virtues, however, and since John Wells is a director of some conscience and screenwriter Steven Knight is in fact capable of first-rate work, \u201cBurnt\u201d packs some minor surprises and attractive details along its way\u2014one sequence in which David draws an analogy between Michelin book stars and \u201cStar Wars\u201d heroes is funny and apt\u2014and shows a certain amount of restraint when the inevitable triumphant note is struck.\u00a0There\u2019s also the cast. If you\u2019ve got any use for Cooper at all you\u2019ll be rather taken with him here. He gets to speak French, throw his own version of a Gordon Ramsey-style fit (many times, even), and does some serious twinkling when it\u2019s time to exercise the charm. The movie goes up several notches in quality every time Emma Thompson, as a sagacious therapist, turns up. Miller is tops, Sy is terrific, Br\u00fchl does quite well, particularly after his character is given a little revelation of his own, and Alicia Vikander makes a strong impression, as she does, in a very brief appearance. I have made a sacred vow to myself not to use the phrases \u201chungry for more\u201d or \u201cempty calories\u201d in what they call the \u201ckicker\u201d of my review, so forgive me if I end it on the abrupt side.

{"Title": "Una noche", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Lila, the Cuban teenager who is one of the lead characters in Lucy Mulloy's first feature, \"Una Noche,\" says in voiceover that she watches the people return to Havana from Miami, tourists now, and they seem changed: \"They lose that nervous desperation.\" Nervous desperation is the energy of \"Una Noche,\" a sexually charged and tense film that takes place over the course of one very long day in Havana, as three teenagers scheme to put together a raft that will transport them the 90 dangerous miles across the ocean to Miami.  Advertisement After that, their plan gets a little dim. One of the teens has a long-lost father who is in Miami, supposedly, so maybe they'll look him up. None of them speak English. Mulloy also wrote the screenplay, and spent years in Havana researching and finding the perfect non-professional actors who could handle this material. It is a confident and striking debut, with gorgeous and somewhat tragic footage of current-day Havana, in all its dilapidated splendor. The plot hurtles along on its rickety rails, plunging towards that expanse of crashing ocean that represents freedom and escape. Despite the bleak-ness of the situation, the film vibrates with color, noise, music, ferocious arguments (both serious and teasing), and eye-catching snapshots of everyday life in Havana. Lila (Anail\u00edn de la R\u00faa de la Torre) and Elio (Javier N\u00fa\u00f1ez Flori\u00e1n) are twins. Their parents are not so much neglectful as totally preoccupied with their own marital drama. Father is cheating on mother, father comes home and berates mother for the messy house, and so life at home is a big drag. Lila spends her time at the gym taking Taekwondo classes, and being made fun of by the more glamorous girls for her unshaved eyebrows and hairy arms. But her primary relationship is with her brother. Elio works as a cook in a hotel restaurant. He rides his bike along the cracked streets overgrown with weeds, with Lila sitting behind him. He looks out for her, she looks out for him.  But Elio has a secret. Well, a couple of secrets. One is that he is helping his friend Raul (Dariel Arrechaga) put together a plan to get Raul to Miami to find his father. The other secret is deeper and can certainly be guessed at through behavior through the film, although the \"reveal\" doesn't come until late.\u00a0 Elio is resourceful. He knows he needs to procure inner tubes, lumber, a compass, and maybe even a GPS, for the journey. All of this can be found on the flourishing black market. There is one fascinating scene where Elio trades in his bike for an outboard motor (no gasoline included) from a guy who buys and sells things, anything you want, as long as you have something to trade.  Advertisement It all feels quite precarious, and it is. How does one plan for a getaway and yet also maintain the facade that you are not going anywhere? Elio doesn't want to tip anyone off, least of all his sister. But Lila is a sneak and a spy, following her father around, spying on Elio from around corners and palm trees. She can tell that something is up. And she does not like Raul.  Daniel Arrechaga is fantastic as the hot-headed and tormented Raul. He dresses flashily, and dreams of all of the gold chains he will get when he is in America. But the bravado hides a hurt child, abandoned by his father, and now the sole caretaker of his prostitute mother (Maria Adelaida Mendez Bonet) who is also ravaged by AIDS. When we first see his mother, she sits in a dark room, her face drawn and haggard, with a full-body cough. She tries to make her son drink warm milk, and he makes her drink it instead. Later, we see her under a highway overpass, standing with all of the other hookers, going off with a tourist who makes her an offer. It's harrowing. Later, Raul comes across his mother servicing a Western tourist, and accidentally injures the man. The cops are put on Raul's trail. Any sense of delaying his escape is lost. He must leave now, before the cops find him.  The three kids who play the three leads are wonderful in their roles, with that superb naturalism and intuitive power that can come in non-professionals. They know who they are, they know their relationships, they know the stakes. Raul starts drinking halfway through the day, and finds himself in scrape after scrape, and there's a feeling of danger and unpredictability surrounding the guy. But you love him. You love him so much.  Lila and Elio are completely believable as siblings and twins. They are in tune with one another's emotions, they speak in short-hand, and there is an ease and freedom in their body language together. The film ends with a frozen shot of the two of them on the bike which sums up all we have learned about them. (A side note: two of the leads, de la Rua and Florian, disappeared during their trip to the United States for the film's U.S. premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2012. They were supposed to come to New York from Miami, but instead they stayed in Miami, stating that they were seeking political asylum in the United States.)  Havana jumps off the screen in a visceral way. You can smell it, feel it, like a living presence. Raul complains at one point, \"The only things to do here are sweat and fuck.\" The entire atmosphere is jagged with rampant sexuality, street harassment, open prostitution, and cruel jokes. Every interaction takes on a sexualized tone, bordering on violence, which Lila finds tiresome. It takes a lot of energy to bat that nastiness away. You can sense the exhaustion.  Mulloy has a great eye for the unique, the special, in this landscape. There's a lonely shot of Elio riding his bike along the deserted waterfront on a grey day, with the tropic-green waves crashing over the sea wall in towers of foam. \u00a0Havana is a rich cultural landscape, but Mulloy and her cinematographers (Trevor Forrest and Shlomo Godder) zoom in on the particulars. A yellow canary sits in a cage hanging on a hook outside a building. Windchimes of colored glass sway against the white stone background. A hooker's black shoes lie on grimy tile with a wire of Christmas tree lights snaking up the wall, lending garish romantic atmosphere to a transaction devoid of romance. Old withered guys clack dominoes at a table on a sidewalk. Kids run wild in the parks, leaping from the sea wall into the ocean. The cars that glide through the streets are all brightly colored gigantic gas-guzzlers, with gleaming fins from the 1950s, but a closer look shows the decay, the deteriorating steering wheels. These are details, snapshots, fragments, but put together they create a fully-inhabited, three-dimensional reality.  The use of voiceover is problematic, especially when it describes what is already evident in the behavior; Lila tells us \"I didn't know why Elio was being so secretive\" after we've already felt the distance opening up between the siblings, and sensed Lila's anxiety at what will happen if Elio abandons her in Havana.\u00a0But that would count as a nitpick, especially with a film as strong, as sure, as this one.

{"Title": "How to Dance in Ohio", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Alexandra Shiva\u2019s \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio,\u201d premiering Monday\r\nnight on HBO after a successful festival run, is a tender, compassionate look at\r\nthree young women living life on the autism spectrum. In many ways, it\u2019s a\r\nstellar example of what Roger spoke about when he discussed film as an empathy\r\nmachine, offering insight into lives we may not fully understand. It\u2019s a bit shapeless in terms of filmmaking, but this is a \u201ccharacter\r\ndocumentary,\u201d a study of people that you won\u2019t soon forget, and it works on that level. Advertisement \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio\u201d observes different sessions at Amigo Family Counseling, a center for children, teens\r\nand adults with autism. Dr. Emilio Amigo gently motivates his patients with\r\nchallenges designed to show them that their limitations are not as defined as\r\nthey may think they are. Amigo\u2019s approach can be inspirational far beyond that\r\nof his patients, adopting a style that could be best summed up when he says, \u201cThey will believe they can succeed when they\r\nsucceed.\u201d He doesn\u2019t coddle his patients, but instead sets up challenges\r\nthat he knows they can surpass. Shiva\u2019s whole film works off Amigo\u2019s balance of\r\nempowerment and safety. People with autism often fear for their own security, and\r\nAmigo teaches them that they can be happy, highly functioning and not be\r\nafraid. We can all take something away from when he says, \u201cLet\u2019s give it up for butterflies! That means you\u2019re alive!\u201d Shiva's film chronicles\r\nthe three months leading up to an Amigo Family Counseling Formal Dance. Yes,\r\nhis patients will have to get dressed up, interact, slow dance and even line\r\ndance. If you think about it, a formal dance is a series of social\r\ninteractions, whether they\u2019re dancing in a group with others, asking someone\r\nyou like to cut a rug, or even just socializing around the punch bowl. As\r\nexpected, most of Amigo\u2019s patients are fearful, but they work towards the big\r\nday, wondering who to ask as their date and even going dress-shopping. In particular, Shiva focuses on three women\u2014a 16-year-old named Marideth, a\r\n19-year-old named Caroline and a 22-year-old named Jessica. Labels like\r\nautistic often paint with a broad brush for people who hear them; one\r\nlesson to be learned by \u201cOhio\u201d is the notable differences between these three\r\nyoung ladies. Marideth seems to just be coming out of her shell. Her parents\r\nnote that they only get two minutes of conversation, but that\u2019s two minutes\r\nmore than they used to get. She\u2019s unpredictable in her degree of confidence,\r\ntelling Shiva that she likes to research and then shutting down when asked what she likes to research. Caroline has a boyfriend she met in Amigo\u2019s class, and\r\nshe\u2019s going to other classes, but is nervous about taking the bus to get there.\r\nJessica gets the most screen time, and she\u2019s close to being completely\r\nindependent, even working a bakery, although she sometimes struggles with\r\nco-workers.  Advertisement How will I know what to say to someone when they talk to me?\r\nHow will I know if someone is joking? What do I say when I\u2019m nervous? Most people\r\nwith autism can\u2019t inherently and instinctually respond to social cues like you\r\nor me. And \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio\u201d deftly captures that aspect of the condition.\r\nWe see Marideth, Caroline and Jessica taking small steps forward, although the\r\nfilm is careful not to present their condition as something that needs a cure.\r\nIt\u2019s just a fact of their lives, something they use Dr. Amigo\u2019s class to\r\nmanage. The best elements of \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio\u201d don\u2019t feel like a\r\ndisease-of-the-week documentary\u2014on the contrary, they illuminate the\r\ncommonality we\u2019ve all faced at a difficult job or nerve-inducing formal dance.\r\nWe\u2019ve all felt those butterflies.

That\u2019s\r\nhow conscientiously structured it is.

She tells him he\r\nreally ought to settle down, family is everything, etc. Whereupon Garza takes\r\nsaid partner out on a drug bust and, well take a wild guess.

The barmaid and Garza end up together, in a family way,\r\nand then she\u2019s kidnapped by the same drug dealers who got his partner, and the\r\nU.S. feds get involved (Eric Roberts plays the head honcho). It's a big mess. It\u2019s an even bigger mess because the movie is so haphazardly edited. One\r\nunderstands the effect that Begne\u2019s aiming for\u2014flashing forward and backward in\r\nshort order during certain scenes to highlight bits of information that are\r\nmeant to pay off in \u201caha!\u201ds for the\r\nviewer\u2014but the execution is staggeringly shoddy and stumbling. The ostensible\r\nhumor\u2014diarrhea jokes, amputated-finger-of-a-corpse jokes, burning-people-alive\r\njokes\u2014competes with plot complications thrown about willy-nilly.

There isn\u2019t really\r\na \u201cHot Pink\u201d dial on a color-correcting console. But you know what I\u2019m saying.  Eventually, the movie works up a weird fascination.

{"Title": "The Hunting Ground", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Director Kirby Dick & Producer Amy Ziering follow up their award-winning \u201cThe\r\nInvisible War\u201d with another incendiary, shocking, infuriating masterpiece, \u201cThe\r\nHunting Ground.\u201d Again, they tackle an institution that has engendered a\r\nclimate in which sexual assault has nearly become normalized, an expectation on\r\ncertain college campuses. Over the next year, over 100,000 women will be\r\nsexually assaulted on college campuses. As disturbing as the actual crimes are,\r\nDick & Ziering point a righteous finger at the administrations that know\r\ntheir campuses live up to the title of this film for young women and yet they\r\ndo nothing in the pursuit of the almighty dollar. Our institutions of higher\r\nlearning are often sacrificing the safety of the children who go there in order\r\nto quash statistics that might hurt enrollment. It is an infuriating reality\r\nthat \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d exposes. I was rattled watching it, finding it hard\r\nto catch my breath and harder still to imagine how many people are in positions\r\nof power who have heard these stories so many times and turned their backs on\r\nvictims.  Advertisement It is a bit of a cruel joke that Dick & Ziering open\r\ntheir film with home videos of high school students reading their acceptance\r\nletters to the tune of \u201cPomp & Circumstance.\u201d And yet it\u2019s appropriate\r\nbecause it sets up a very vital theme in \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d\u2014that of the\r\nwide-eyed, optimistic teenager who really just wants to get an education but\r\nhas been sold a false bill of goods about their own safety. Lest you think any\r\nof this might be exaggerated for cinematic impact, the filmmakers pepper their\r\nentire film with jaw-dropping facts. 16-20% of undergraduates will be sexually\r\nassaulted. Even more won\u2019t report it for fear of falling into the category of a\r\nvictim or having to deal with an administration and society quick to blame the\r\nvictim. When one rape victim reports that the administrator to whom she\r\nreported the crime compared rape to a football game\u2014\u201cwhat would have done\r\ndifferently in the game?\u201d\u2014I literally wanted to start screaming. And that\u2019s\r\nwhat Dick & Ziering want. We should be screaming. The stats continue. In 2012, 40% of all colleges reported no\r\nsexual assaults. If there\u2019s anyone out there who actually believes that 2 out\r\nof 5 college campuses in this country actually had no sexual assaults that year, I\u2019m impressed you know how to use\r\nthe internet. What is actually happening is a very careful protection of the\r\nbrand name that is a college reputation. And it\u2019s happening everywhere. Even at\r\na place like Harvard, people are asking questions like \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you fight\r\nhim?\u201d At the University of Virginia, they had ZERO expulsions for sexual\r\nassault in the same time period that they had 183 for cheating and other\r\nacademic violations. Expelling cheaters looks better to check-cutting parents\r\nthan telling them that their child may not be safe. And this environment of denial\r\nallows for repeat offenders, who commit an average of SIX assaults. In some\r\ncases, they are literally given sanctuary in athletic facilities. Campus security\r\nat Notre Dame cannot contact athletes for any reason, even if a rape has been\r\nreported.  As a director, Dick knows how to build a case, intercutting\r\ninterviews with statistics that portray an epidemic, a crisis, a serious\r\nproblem for all Americans of all ages. Most importantly, they empower the\r\nvictims, giving them a platform from which to speak that the institutions that\r\nthey supported through attendance and tuition did not. And they focus most of\r\ntheir energy on two young women from North Carolina\u2014Andrea Pino and Annie E.\r\nClark\u2014who were raped on their campus and turned their stories into rallying\r\ncries for change across the country. Just as they did with Kori Cioca in \u201cThe\r\nInvisible War,\u201d the directors present true heroism in Pino and Clark, two\r\npeople who stood up for victim\u2019s rights and ended up revealing the depth of a problem\r\nthat I don\u2019t think even they knew was so widespread. \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d could\r\nhave been a series of disturbing statistics and personal stories, but the\r\ndirectors know that it is the survivors who are trying to enact change who will\r\ninspire viewers to support the action needed to make it so.  Advertisement The structure of \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d gets repetitive but\r\nthat\u2019s by design and Dick does an admirable job of subtly moving\r\nthrough different aspects of the issue from the lack of institutional response\r\nto the frat system to the athletic program, even spending a notable amount of\r\ntime on the Jameis Winston story and Florida State\u2019s disturbing response or\r\nlack thereof to the accusations against the soon-to-be NFL player. Whether or\r\nnot you believe Winston\u2019s accuser is not the issue\u2014although his fans and those\r\nof the program he led to glory will see it that way. No, the issue is that\r\nvictims are presumed to either be a contributing factor in the crime or\r\ndismissed altogether, especially when the accused is a superstar athlete.

{"Title": "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Fantasy (in this sense) is, I think, not a lower but a higher form of Art, indeed the most nearly pure form, and so (when achieved) the most potent.\" -J.R.R. Tolkien, March 8, 1939 lecture \"Fairy Stories\" Tolkien's parenthetical \"when achieved\" is the kicker of that statement, the acknowledgement of how difficult and rare successful fantasy really is. You know it when you see it. This reviewer did not find that quality in \"An Unexpected Journey\", the first installment of Peter Jackson's gigantic trilogy based on Tolkien's slim one-volume classic \"The Hobbit,\" but it is there in spades in part two, \"The Desolation of Smaug.\" This middle chapter is about a half-hour too long, and the final third splits the story up into three pieces, weakening the narrative thrust that had been building, but no matter: By the time we get to Bilbo Baggins' confrontation with the dragon Smaug (voiced with delicious sneering evil by Benedict Cumberbatch), the real work has been done. The thematic elements are in place, the emotional tension is highly strung, and the action unfolds in a wave like the fire erupting from the dragon's mouth, overtaking all in its path.\u00a0 Advertisement Except for a flashback which shows Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the exiled dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) joining forces in a dark and beer-soaked pub straight out of Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", \"The Desolation of Smaug\" picks up where the last one left off, with Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the posse of rowdy dwarves deep into their journey to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and the dwarves' lost kingdom.\u00a0 Bilbo, dragged reluctantly from his comfy hole-in-the-ground in the Shire in the first film, is now resigned to his fate, and shows resourcefulness and pluck in one harrowing situation after another. He's also got that mysterious golden ring he found in the goblin tunnel\u2014the one that seems to make him invisible, the one that nobody else knows about, not yet. It will come in handy. Gandalf tries to keep the team together, but forges off on his own solitary spell-breaking mission (which Tolkien's book suggests is undertaken by Gandalf to force Bilbo to gain the trust of the dwarves on his own). Along the way, the heroes find shelter in the home of a shape-shifting Giant-slash-Bear, and are pursued by a galloping army of Orcs. To save time, they cut through the Mirkwood Forest and run into a terrifying herd of gigantic attacking spiders, in a scene doomed to give me nightmares for months. (I have barely recovered from reading that scene in the book when I was 10 years old.) Saved and then imprisoned by the isolationist-minded elves, the dwarves and Bilbo find a way to escape in a bunch of barrels down a river, being attacked from the banks by orcs and elves alike.\u00a0 Some old friends show up: cool-eyed Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). There's a new elf in town, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), who is drawn to one of the dwarves; the romantic triangle she sparks has nothing to do with anything, but it is still nice to see Tauriel act as a deus ex machina on a couple of occasions. Stephen Fry has a great cameo as the Master of Lake-Town, a despicable and gout-ridden person lording it over his fearful constituents from on high; it's a Dickensian piece of scene-chewing.\u00a0 Advertisement Jackson and his team have a lot of fun creating these three-dimensional worlds, overwhelming us with different moods, energies, and personalities. Some of the images are breathtaking: the Long Lake swathed in mist with mysterious structures rising out of it; the misty dark wood filled with shadowy waiting creatures; the elegant vertical fortress of the elves, soothing and yet rigid, too, indicating the elves' unwillingness to get involved in the larger dark forces overtaking the outside world. \u00a0The final confrontation with the dragon, when it comes, is worth the wait (although it would have been nice if the wait hadn't been quite so long).\u00a0The dragon's lair is gorgeously imagined, an undulating and ever-changing landscape of coins and gold. There are lots of great moments: a gigantic tapestry falling from the wall in a rippling wave; huge collapsing columns; tiny walkways over the abyss; the dwarves' visible awe at their ancestors' ingenuity and power. Throughout, you get the sense that you really are in a lost and glorious world. \u00a0 And yet for all its scope, there's also a kind of homespun silliness in Tolkien's book\u2014a \"Tut tut, isn't everything just a bit\u00a0much?\" energy, stereotypically British, which has sometimes been lost in the other films, overwhelmed as they are by portent and meaning. \u00a0It's not lost this time. That barrel scene, for example, goes on for what feels like forever, and every second is justified. It has its own momentum, chaotic and jubilant, reaching an almost screwball climax, as events catapult out of control and nobody is sure which end is up, least of all the dwarves.\u00a0Smaug is a fearsome beast, but you still laugh at the detail of Bilbo wincing at the breath emerging from the dragon's mouth. (Now\u00a0that's\u00a0the Bilbo I recognize from the book.)\u00a0 There's a moment before the spider attack that perfectly\u00a0aligns us with the overall intent of Tolkien's fiction. Bilbo is told to climb one of the trees to peek out of the top of the forest and see how much further they have to go. When he pushes his head through the top, all he can see is a carpet of autumn leaves spreading almost as far as the eye can see, with blue butterflies flitting about along the leaf-tips. The sun shines brightly, and for a moment Bilbo is awestruck. We know that what happens next is bound to be grisly and terrible. But beauty is there to be appreciated, and the hobbits, with their love of homey nature, pretty colors, and comfort, know this as well as we do.\u00a0It was the love of home that kept people going in the dark years during which Tolkien wrote these volumes, when the shadow of war overhung Europe.\u00a0The sunlight-drenched green fields of the Shire are long gone by that point in Bilbo's story, a distant memory, but the memory gives Bilbo his power. It is worth fighting for.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Past Life", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Hollywood lost the knack of creating multi-leveled character dramas quite some time ago. For these, movie lovers now have to look to Europe, Asia\u2014and to the Middle East. The work of Asghar Farhadi, the Iranian writer/director, is knotty and ever engrossing, illuminating moral and ethical concerns in the contexts of domestic stories always rooted in immediate social reality. The recent films of the Israeli director Avi Nesher (who worked in Hollywood in the 1990s, largely on genre pictures) are not dissimilar\u2014full-bodied, complex, densely written. His latest, \u201cPast Life,\u201d is a story about reckoning with the past that begins with a bang. Advertisement The year is 1977. An Israeli choir is performing a concert in Berlin. In the audience an older woman peruses the concert program. She looks up the name of the lovely young woman giving a soprano solo during one piece. She recognizes that name. At a reception afterwards, the older woman, Agnieszka (Katarzyna Gniewkowska), approaches the young singer, Sephi Milch (Joy Rieger). Sephi speaks no German or Polish, and Agnieszka speaks no Hebrew. And yet, in the course of a fraught exchange during which Agnieszka grasps Sephi\u2019s wrist most aggressively, the point is made: Agnieszka knew Sephi\u2019s father, and Sephi\u2019s father was a murderer. Back home in Israel, the father we meet does not square with that description. Baruch Milch (Doron Tavory) is stiff and strict with his family but in his practice as a physician he\u2019s both no-nonsense and honestly compassionate. Sephi tells her older sister, Nana (Nelly Tagar) about her odd Berlin encounter and Nana, a journalist, takes up the story. Together they make some discoveries that disturb the hell out of them, and they confront their father. Baruch does not flinch. Rather, he welcomes the opportunity to unburden himself of the past and set the record straight. As a persecuted Jew during the Holocaust, he was protected by a Polish family. But he did not get out entirely \u201cclean\u201d so to speak.  The thread of discovery in this film\u2019s storyline is accompanied by others. There\u2019s Sephi\u2019s musical work. She\u2019s a singer, but also a composer, and her academy instructor is extremely discouraging. \u201cFocus on your singing, not your dreams.\u201d Her deliverance of sorts comes in the form of a visiting composer from Germany. Who happens to be a relative of the woman who accosted her at the concert in Berlin. In the meantime, Nana remains suspicious of her father, and her lack of faith in him turns into a disillusionment with life itself\u2014which is of little help to her spirits once she learns she has cancer.  Advertisement If \u201cPast Life\u201d stumbles at all, it\u2019s in the scenes in which it intercuts between Nana\u2019s medical traumas and Sephi\u2019s continued detective work on a trip to Warsaw\u2014the idea of a certain kind of faith constituting a sort of lifeline is made too literal for my tastes here. But the movie shines in all other respects. The characterizations are spectacularly convincing across the board, the acting honors those characterizations fully. The period detail is present but not ostentatious. And the movie\u2019s climax, in which all the threads are not-quite pulled together, is a very moving one, one in which forgiveness is sought, and the difficulty of bestowing forgiveness is acknowledged. This is a striking and thought-provoking picture.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Bleed for This", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Bleed for This\" starts out like a traditional underdog-fighter-makes-good flick, based on a true story, pivots and becomes something else, then goes back to being traditional.  Miles Teller plays Vinny Paz, aka Pazienza, aka The Pazmanian  Devil, an Italian-American junior welterweight fighter from Rhode Island. He's a likable, young, working class guy who doesn't take the sport as seriously as he should. He barely makes weight and stays out all night before fights blowing his money on gambling. His domineering dad (Ciaran Hinds) hooks him up with legendary trainer Kevin Rooney (Aaron Eckhart), one of the wizards who helped channel Mike Tyson's rage. It's Rooney who recommends that Paz move up one weight class, a bold move. Everyone else in Paz's circle (including his manager\u00a0Lou Duva, played by gravel-voiced character actor Ted Levine, who's never looked worse or more weirdly compelling) thinks it's a bad idea. But it turns out to be a stroke of genius. Paz becomes not just a winner but a sensation, beating champ Roberto Duran (Edwin Rodriguez, radiating intelligence and focus) and priming himself for stardom. Advertisement Then he gets blindsided by life: a car slams into him head-on as he's driving to the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut and throws his vehicle into a ditch. His spine is damaged. He has to wear a \"halo\" to keep his head upright; it sits on his shoulders like scaffolding, but despite the theologically loaded name of the device, director Ben Younger (\"Boiler Room\") and cinematographer Larkin Seiple restrain themselves from playing up the Christ-crucified parallels that are sure to form in viewers' minds. The doctor tells him not only will he never fight again, he'll probably  never walk again. Undaunted, Paz charms Rooney into undertaking a secret training  regimen in his parents' basement, and the film becomes a recovery story. The emphasis is mainly on what the injury does to Paz's body, and how he manages and transcends the pain: a mind-over-matter narrative. The problem, though, is that we never get enough sense of Paz's interior life to judge this movie as anything other than a comeback story about a nice guy who got knocked out by the cosmos and hauled himself up. Its modesty is welcome, and its deep knowledge of boxing pictures and sports weepies helps the story glide along. Still, there's a deeper, more powerful tale here that remains frustratingly untapped, maybe because the film knows that if it got too messy, contradictory or raw, it would lose the \"inspirational\" label and become art. Many reviews of this film have complained about how predictable the story is, which seems like an odd complaint, given the script's basis in fact. But if you think of \"Bleed for This\" in terms of a commercial drama rather than as a simple story of a man rebuilding his life, you might have to admit they're on to something.  The direction, the photography, the editing, the production design and most of the performances are on point. And there are ways in which \"Bleed for This\" transcends cliche\u2014mainly in the sociological margins of the story. We get more journalistic details than pictures like this often provide: the scene-setting driving shots of Providence and leafy surrounding counties, the texture of the wood paneled walls in characters' homes, the cigarettes they smoke, the beer they drink, and the cadence of their talk, which often revolves around men expressing love by busting each other's chops. \"You get cable with that thing?\" Rooney asks Paz, indicating his halo. \"You got heart, kid,\" Duva tells Paz, \"but you wear it on your fuckin' chin.\" \u00a0 Advertisement The film excels in its portrayal of what it means to be injured. Too many boxing films downplay the fragility of the body, unless a hero is being warned that if he keeps fighting, he'll go blind or suffer brain damage (he always disregards the warning and wins anyway). The middle section of \"Bleed for This,\" which focuses on Paz and Rooney's secret rehab project, is an exception. We see Paz sneaking into the basement, gingerly sliding onto his weight bench, and trying to bench-press a barbell he hasn't touched in years, then removing weight after weight until only the bar remains. The first rule of rehab is \"start small.\" It's great to see a movie not only acknowledge this reality, but make the man embracing it seem heroic.\u00a0 But the movie has major problems. The biggest is Teller, a committed and likable actor miscast as Paz. You're aware of how hard he must have worked to get in shape, sell the accent, get the demeanor right, and so on, but he's never wholly credible as the hero. This performance feels built from without, not found within. Teller lacks the affable meathead quality that made Mark Wahlberg so compelling in \"The Fighter,\" the movie that this film's modern, white ethnic, working class setting evokes. He's just right in films like \"The Spectacular Now\" and \"Whiplash,\" playing nonviolent guys struggling with specific personal demons, but I never bought him here as an Italian-American, a guy with a working class sensibility, or a boxer who's driven and skilled enough to win five world titles in three different weight classes (lightweight, junior middleweight and super middleweight). He's bouncy, even chirpy, verging on Tom Hanks or John Cusack in light-comic-lead mode, and while he gets certain signatures right in the ring (such as Paz's whirligig punch) the editing and camerawork often seem to be doing too much of the work for him (when he throws a flurry of combinations, he looks like he's dog-paddling).  To be fair, the writing and filmmaking are probably as much at fault as Teller\u2014actors are only as good as their collaborators and their material\u2014but it's a debilitating strike against the movie. The supporting cast, though, is flawless, especially Katey Sagal as Paz's mom, who listens to fights from the next room because she can't bear to watch her boy get hit on TV, and Eckhart, whose transformation into Rooney is both emotionally and physically complete. He seems to have made himself shorter and changed his bone structure, which is not something they teach you at Stella Adler. When his character appeared onscreen for the first time, I mistook him for Dean Norris. Teller can't keep up with any of them. He's a promising junior welterweight, and this is a heavyweight cast. Advertisement The frame the movie puts around Paz's comeback is iffy, too. It's unabashed in telling us that Paz reset his life through optimism, stubbornness and hard work. There's no denying Paz's achievement, but it's one rarely shared by people who've suffered massive physical trauma, and it would've been nice if the film had acknowledged that. As is, there are scenes and moments (particularly during Paz's closing interview, a bewildering mistake) where \"Bleed for This\" seems to be suggesting that if Paz did it, you can, too, and if you can't, it's because you didn't try hard enough. That surely wasn't the point, but it's what comes across, and it gives what might otherwise have been a pretty good, occasionally inspired sports movie a sour aftertaste.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Big Short", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The pre-release buzz is true: This is not your father\u2019s\r\nfinancial crisis movie. Nor, for that matter, is it \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d\r\nThe money masters of the universe depicted in this film\u2014and while their stories\r\nare interconnected, their lives are not, necessarily\u2014barely drink a sufficient\r\namount of red wine to get a good buzz on. Their buzz derives from an enhanced\r\nsense of smell. The closest to a \u201cWolf\u201d-like character here is Ryan Gosling\u2019s\r\nJared Vennett, the most standard-issue suit-and-tie banking bro of the bunch,\r\nand part of his schtick is to stand in a conference room sniffing\r\nostentatiously because, yes, he smells money.  Advertisement The money smelt, and earned, by the adventurers of this\r\nstory of the real-life 2008 world economic meltdown is arguably tainted by bad\r\nkarma. Based on a book by Michael Lewis, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d is about how several\r\ntraders and hedge fund managers made fortunes because they saw that the housing\r\nmarket\u2019s decline would cause a collapse of bonds contrived from sub-prime\r\nmortgages. The terminology is both dry and dizzying, the machinations\r\nincredibly convoluted. The main thesis of the story, adapted for the screen by\r\ndirector Adam McKay and his co-screenwriter Charles Randolph, is that as\r\nbanking became the top industry of the United States, bankers deliberately\r\nconcocted Byzantine financial tools whose main function was to help the rich\r\nget richer and screw over the little guy. You can expect a lot of pushback\r\nagainst this film of the \u201cwhere do these affluent Hollywood types get off\r\ncriticizing income inequality\u201d but that won\u2019t mean the movie is wrong.  And it really is quite a movie: entertaining and engaging,\r\nbut also mortifying; a good alternate title might be \u201cAmerican Horror Story.\u201d The film intertwines\r\nthree discrete storylines. The first focuses on Christian Bale\u2019s Michael Burry,\r\na trained physician with very stunted social skills whose genius at analysis\r\nand numbers-crunching found him running a very successful West Coast hedge\r\nfund. After finding some terrifying data within the structures of a large\r\nnumber of mortgage bonds, he concocts a radical idea: to \u201cshort,\u201d that is, bet against,\r\nthe housing bond market, which the banks have puffed up as being unassailable.\r\nTo do this he has to convince those banks to create a new financial tool, a\r\nkind of bond insurance policy. If Burry\u2019s right and the market collapses, he\r\nand his hedge fund make stupid money. But for as long as the market stays\r\nstable, Burry and his fund are obliged to pay stupid money in premiums.  McKay is best known as the director of such comedic fare as\r\n\u201cAnchorman,\u201d and, for all the silly self-reflexive humor in those films, there\u2019s\r\na sly underlying intelligence animating them, and here that takes the form of\r\ncelebrity cameos wherein attractive people such as Margot Robbie and Selena\r\nGomez directly address the audience with cogent and colorful explanations of\r\nterms such as \u201csub-prime.\u201d He also enlists \u201cAnchorman\u201d rep company member Steve\r\nCarell for one main role, as financial Prophet of Doom Mark Baum, whose own\r\nfund gets a whiff of what Gosling\u2019s character is smelling and takes a piece of\r\nthe action, in a partial fit of \u201cscrew the system\u201d indignation. Carell\u2019s\r\nself-torturing character is likely the closest thing this movie has to a\r\ndirectorial surrogate. Finn Wittrock and John Magaro play a couple of Jim\r\nHenson\u2019s Hedge Fund Babies, mentored by Brad Pitt\u2019s Ben Rickert. Rickert\u2019s\r\ncharacter can be read as something of a slight sendup of Pitt\u2019s own current\r\ndo-gooder persona; he\u2019s a former master trader who left the game out of\r\ndisgust, and who preaches a hippie-ish quasi-survivalist gospel to his two\r\nyoung acolytes even as he helps them get pretty much super-rich. Advertisement I started off feeling skeptical about this movie: the\r\nhairstyles and clothes of the main characters were more \u201890s music-video than\r\nearly 2000s, and the sometimes-color-desaturated flashbacks to some characters\u2019\r\nback stories were a little on the drearily commonplace side. But the narrative\r\nmomentum, combined with the profane wit of much of the dialogue, and the\r\ncommitted acting going on beneath the hairpieces, all did their job. And they\r\ngot across the angry, pessimistic conviction behind the movie, which is that\r\nthe major banks all engaged in fraudulent, criminal activity, and that the U.S.\r\ngovernment bailed them out at the expense of the little guy, and that there\u2019s\r\nno indication that the banks aren\u2019t going to do something like the exact same\r\nthing all over again. You are free to disagree. But this is a movie that uses\r\nboth cinema art and irrefutable facts to make its case. It\u2019s strong stuff.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Jauja", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Jauja,\" a period drama set in Argentina's Patagonia region starring Viggo Mortensen, is one the most original and peculiar adventure films in recent memory; it's firmly in the wheelhouse of Argentinian director Lisandro Alonso's previous films (\"Los Muertos,\" \"Liverpool\"), and your your affinity for it will depend mainly on your willingness to roll with its style, tone and pace. You'll describe it as \"patient\" or \"deliberate\" if you like it, \"slow\" if you don't, \"gorgeous\" if it pleases you, \"pretentious\" or some-such otherwise. In any case, it's a rare film one can describe as a series of paintings come to life. Shot on 35mm film in 4x3 aspect ratio (the shape of old movies, complete with rounded frame-edges), it allows Alonso to further hone his style of picking a shot and sticking with it as long as he possibly can, while characters move slowly through the frame, or sit still and talk, or think, or be.  Advertisement There is a story: Danish Captain Gunnar Dinesen (Mortensen) leads a band of men assigned to kill Aboriginals living in the country's desert. During his sojourn there, his daughter, Ingeborg (Viilbj\u00f8rk Malling Agger), who is stationed with him, runs off with a young soldier named Corto (Misael Saavedra), causing Dinesen to take off in pursuit. This sounds like a variant of the Western wilderness-kidnap film, and the scenery certainly would seem ripe for that.  But Alonso and his cinematographer Timo Salminen aren't interested in traditional beats. As the story moves us from calm to violence and back to calm again at the end, the storytelling, indeed the cutting from scene to scene (there are few scenes with more than one shot), thwarts any expectations we carried into the film, not just in terms of story, but rhythm. You never know how long a shot will last or what it'll emphasize.  The movie opens with a static image of two characters sitting on a rock for several minutes, and continues that way even when the story allegedly kicks in and Dinesen rides off to find his daughter. A shocking act of violence is revealed as aftermath, and you don't even see the moment of discovery in closeup. A conversation between Dinesen and a hateful underling who describes the aboriginals as \"coconut-heads\" and blithely argues for their extermination is chilling not just because of the content of the conversation, but because of the way Alonso lets Dinesen exit the frame while staying on the underling for a long moment, letting us observe his utter disgust at a man who thinks less of him because he's a white supremacist.  As in films by Werner Herzog, Terrence Malick and Theo Angelopoulos, the filmmaking encourages us to think less about what motivates the characters (their drives are often hazy) than their existence within the context of a land and an era that is ultimately indifferent to their dramas. The slow (or \"deliberate\") pace makes the mind wander away from the absence of expected values and focus instead on the presence of ones you don't normally get from scripted features. You may find yourself noticing a soldier's blazing red trousers against the green lichens and thinking about how inappropriate, and somehow strangely arrogant, they are, and how this juxtaposition of colors seems to summarize the mentality of those who would try to invade and subjugate terrain they barely understand.  Advertisement The performances are entirely without vanity, including that of Mortensen, an international star who fits right into the period and seems unencumbered by contemporary neuroses (though the character has plenty from that era). The actor was born in New York City, spent his early childhood in Denmark but was raised in Argentina and speaks fluent Spanish; he would seem like a perfect fit for this extremely specific role even if he didn't have such extraordinary yet unaffected control over his face and body, always suggesting Dinesen's emotional interior but never indicating.  The performances mesh beautifully with the filmmaking, which is more keenly attuned to fluctuations in the natural world that all but a handful of modern motion pictures. The wind, the chirping birds, the gently lapping waves all center the mind, and this both amplifies the film's physical beauty and makes the increasingly shocking events seem eerier, more dreamlike. A title card informs us that Jauja is a fabled \"earthly paradise\" that many sought, and that they all \"got lost along the way.\" The getting lost part is key to the experience. The whole film feels purposefully unmoored. That might sound like an oxymoron if you haven't seen it, after which point it feels more like a reason for being. The final few shots assert the supremacy of nature and time over human concerns. Their spareness is haiku-like.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Quitters", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "It's not fun following teenage kid Clark (Ben Konigsberg) around for an hour and a half. Clark is the lead character in Noah Pritzker's debut feature \"Quitters\" (Pritzker co-wrote the script with Ben Tarnoff), and he is manipulative, passive-aggressive, and a user with zero sense of humor. Teenagers are often annoying, of course. And teenage angst and peer pressure and the newness of some experiences make them all act a little nuts. But Clark is a horse of a different color. Konigsberg, to his credit, does not soft-pedal any of Clark's personality flaws, a remarkable accomplishment for such a young actor. But, still, \"Quitters\" is a challenging and joyless experience. The title of the film is accurate. Everyone here quits: on themselves, on situations, doing drugs, staying in relationships. Considering his selfish parents, it's no wonder Clark has made an art out of bailing (often with great cruelty) when things get tough. Advertisement Clark's mother (Mira Sorvino) is in rehab for prescription-pill addiction. (\"Technically, your mother's not an addict. She has a 'dependency,'\", says Clark's weak stoner dad, played by Greg Germann). Clark has a crush on a classmate named Etta (Kara Hayward), and when she rebuffs his advances, he responds by dropping her as a friend via vicious condescending email, and then spreading rumors around school that she struggles with depression. Clark cannot stand his father, whom he treats with contemptuous superiority. Clark decides to quit his own awful family and become part of another. Crashing in the home of friend Natalia (Morgan Turner), he worms his way into the family's routines and, in a particularly bleak scene,\u00a0into Natalia's bed. Saffron Burrows and Scott Lawrence play the parents who welcome Clark into their home without once calling Clark's dad to see if it's okay. (It calls to mind that funny line from \"While You Were Sleeping\": \u201cLucy, you are born into a family. You do not join them like the Marines.\u201d)\u00a0 To be fair, \"Quitters\" does not plead with us to sympathize with Clark. Pritzker and Tarnoff present him in a very straightforward way, showing us what he does, how he does it and his emotional brutality. \"Quitters\" also does not turn him into a case study (his mother has a \"dependency\" and his dad's a loser, and that's why he's this way!) Clark is smart, but he is also lazy. He goes for what he wants, whether it's a condom he steals out of Natalia's mom's drawer, or challenging his teacher Mr. Becker (Kieran Culkin) to give him a better grade. Sorvino is great in the small role of Clark's tear-stained, checked-out mother, calling and texting him desperately from rehab, but detached from any sense of real responsibility. Kieran Culkin is equal parts disturbing and endearing as the schlubby Mr. Becker, such a different role than the one he just played in Todd Solondz's \"Wiener-Dog.\" Mr. Becker works on a novel in his off-hours, and seems like a big clueless kid himself, hanging out by the microwave, staring at it as it heats up his pizza. He's tough on his students, but he's weak too. You can practically see the broken dreams scattered around his feet shuffling down the hallway. Advertisement At a certain point, a pretty basic thought comes up: What exactly is the story being told here? The pedestrian style does not help. The scenes look like they're from a 1980s TV movie, with little to no imagination or tension in the editing or angles. A beautiful piano theme by David Shire is yearning, nostalgic, sweet, all qualities which do not enter into \"Quitter\"'s emotional landscape at all. Fictional characters, even leads, don't need to be \"relatable\" or likable. They don't even need to be sympathetic. What they need to be is watchable, which Konigsberg is. Watching him operate (he doesn't do it by stealth, he comes right out with it), is fascinating in a creepy way. He takes what he wants, walks away without blinking, and has no compunction about re-approaching people he's hurt if he then needs something from them. His rear view mirror is filled with burned bridges already. He's a sociopath in training. Very few actors can be both opaque and revealing at the same time. Alain Delon can do it, but that's a pretty high bar. Konigsberg struggles a little bit in that department. There are times when the camera lingers on his face, and there is nothing going on; it is impossible to tell what he's thinking. And it's impossible to tell if that's the point. It may very well be. The teenage discontent and rage plus Clark's runaway status calls to mind Holden Caulfield in \"Catcher in the Rye,\" but the comparison falls apart on closer examination. Holden had a sense of humor as well as at least being capable of intimate relationships with both of his siblings, dead and alive. Clark, following the example of his wretched parents, is already way beyond that. The more apt comparison would be Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley from her famous \"Ripley\" novels (Alain Delon, incidentally, in all his gorgeous chilly cunning, played Tom Ripley in \"Purple\u00a0Noon.\") Clark isn't as bad as Tom Ripley. Yet. Maybe he'll turn out okay. I doubt it, but maybe. Maybe he's just surrounded by\u00a0quitters, and he senses it, and he hates it. The film doesn't say.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Kings of Summer", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "High school student Joe (Nick Robinson) lives with his father (Nick Offerman), a stern man sitting on a volcano of anger. Joe's mother has died. He has an older sister (played by \"Mad Men\"'s Alison Brie), but she is engaged and out of the house. The tension between father and son is oppressive, and the rules feel arbitrary and unfair to Joe. During one night when the family gathers to play Monopoly, like they used to do when Mom was alive, the tension explodes. Joe didn't want to play anyway, he wanted to go to a party with his friends. After a fight with his dad, Joe ends up calling the police, claiming physical abuse. It's a radical move, dark and evocative of a deep psychological schism. There's a furious and smart movie inside \"The Kings of Summer,\" a first feature by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, a film about three teenage boys who take to the woods to build a house from scratch and live outside not only parental supervision but community norms and expectations. Unfortunately, despite some beautiful sequences and solid acting, the script by first-timer Chris Galletta pulls its punches, over-explains the emotional meaning of its moments, and tries to lighten the mood in sometimes awkward sit-com-style ways, betraying the movie's more honest spirit. \"The Kings of Summer\" flirts with profundity, seeming to yearn for it and fear the honest expression of it at the same time. There is much here to admire, but the overall impression is of a film that does not have the courage of its convictions. Advertisement Joe and his buddy Patrick (played by the open-faced and extremely talented Gabriel Basso) have been friends since childhood. Joe has issues with his father, and Patrick is heckled and cooed over by his intrusive well-meaning parents (played, hilariously, by Megan Mullally and Marc Evan Jackson). Nothing seems bad enough here to warrant anyone running away, but \"The Kings of Summer,\" to its credit, is going after a deeper more existential truth, common to most coming-of-age movies, the fact that teenagers are not only looking for freedom, but meaning in their lives. They want to be free to feel deeply, to connect to themselves in respect to their environments, and to choose a life that suits them. One night, after a party, Joe and another kid, a bizarre human being named Biaggio (Moises Arias, who is phenomenal in the role) get lost coming home through the woods. They come upon an open glade, dark and mysterious in the moonlight, so beautiful that the two boys stop dead in their tracks. Joe gets the idea to remove himself from his father's home, and build a house in the woods with Patrick. Biaggio, since he was there that first night, is along for the ride. Patrick bones up on survivalist books from the library, treating the project seriously, liking the image of freedom and manliness that Joe paints for him. They draw floor plans, they pilfer materials from construction sites, they spend their days out in the woods building their house. And then, one night, all three sneak away from home and move in. The community, of course, thinks they have been kidnapped and two cops (Mary Lynn Rajskub and Thomas Middleditch, both fantastic) are assigned to investigate. The parents back home wonder what they did, and Joe's dad, in one awful line, confesses to Patrick's dad, \"I think I've broken my son.\" Meanwhile, out in the woods, the three boys revel in an unfettered life, trying to catch fish and other critters, so that they will be entirely self-sufficient. Joe makes many speeches about masculinity, the script constantly reminding us of the themes underlying the adventure. Advertisement There are some good scenes where we see that a geographical change does not necessarily solve your problems. Patrick tries to tell the other boys not to litter, because it will attract animals, and Joe blows off the advice, annoyed at being told what to do. Joe has a crush on a girl, Kelly (Erin Moriarty), and despite their rule of telling no one about their Swiss Family Robinson/Moonrise Kingdom situation, Joe caves and invites her to visit. She brings a couple of friends. Over a night around the campfire, it becomes clear that Kelly is falling for Patrick, not Joe. Joe reacts with jealousy and rage, exploding at Patrick, referring to Kelly as a \"bitch\", and behaving like the worst kind of emotional bully. As a matter of fact, the contempt he shows for both of them is reminiscent of his father's cold judgmental attitude. If this is what \"being masculine\" means to Joe, it is, perhaps understandable, due to his father's poor example, but the film does not delve deeper into it. It is a giant missed opportunity. Patrick, on the other hand, seems to have a comfort with himself that is natural and easy, igniting Joe's envy. There is a beautiful random shot, unconnected to any other scene, of Patrick sitting in the woods by himself playing a mournful tune on a violin. It's gorgeously shot, and one of the few scenes where everyone is not talking about what everything means. While sitting around the campfire with the girls, we see Patrick going out of his way to make Kelly laugh. Again, the script trembles on the edge of profundity here, making acute observations about different aspects of masculinity, one of them being the ability to include women in that male circle, and to do so without hostility. Lightening the mood with humor is important to such potentially painful material, and there are a couple of legitimately hilarious scenes, mostly involving the self-serious behavior of the two cops, Patrick's parents' comedy routine with one another, and Biaggio's deadpan line delivery. But some of the schtick feels either forced or unfocused, one exchange about cystic fibrosis in particular. Lines from Biaggio like \"I don't see myself as having a gender\" or \"I can read. I just can't cry\" are not explored in a meaningful way. His words are treated as one-liners, tossed off to make an audience laugh, and never visited again, but they act as glimpses of the more honest and interesting movie that could have been. And Joe, who behaves poorly out there in the woods, never seems to come to a realization that he needs to take responsibility for his behavior. Being a man, being an adult, doesn't just mean doing whatever the hell you want to do. The script shies away from its own implications. Advertisement  Vogt-Roberts' direction is often evocative and beautiful, bordering on the surreal at times, his filming of their first glimpse of the glade by moonlight a perfect example. The montage of the boys building the shack in the woods is energetic and emotional. He has a good eye for the interesting, for the unusual image. The over-written script is to blame here. It wants to make sure we get the symbols and metaphors going on, but it also doesn't want to be caught taking itself too seriously. This is an error. Peter Bogdanovich once asked John Wayne about his famously bold gestures onscreen, and Wayne replied, \"I think that's the first lesson you learn in a high school play \u2014 that if you're going to make a gesture, make it.\" \"The Kings of Summer\" should take that advice. You have a gesture you want to make, so make it.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Den of Thieves", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The first thing you should know about this movie is that, yup, it really is two hours and twenty minutes long. A fellow reviewer and I were discussing the timing given by the IMDb and we both thought, no way can this probably relatively dinky cops-and-robbers picture be almost two and a half hours. But it is. \u201cDen of Thieves\u201d opens with some text explaining just how many bank robberies occur in Los Angeles California over the span of one year\u2014broken down by months, days, hours, and minutes. Having rolled out the stats, and they are impressive, the text concludes that \u201cLos Angeles in the bank robbery capital of the world.\u201d Already one feels the movie, co-written and directed by Christian Gudegast, is doing some kind of special pleading. There are four million stories in this naked city, and not all of them can be \u201cHeat,\u201d but this one is KINDA like that, okay? Advertisement Indeed, the movie begins with crime that\u2019s committed like a paramilitary operation. An armored car stops at a donut place and an SUV full of masked men armed to the teeth swoop in on it. A dropped coffee sets off a trigger-happy heist man, and a near-massacre ensues. This crew didn\u2019t want it that way, but as its mastermind, Merriman (Pablo Schreiber) glumly notes when they\u2019ve gotten to safety, \u201cNow we\u2019re cop-killers.\u201d And they did it all for an empty truck.\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the things that Gerard Butler\u2019s \u201cBig\u201d Nick Davis, the major crimes cop on the scene, has to figure out. He runs a half-rogue crew he calls \u201cThe Regulators,\u201d and they\u2019re not above kidnapping and torturing suspected perps to get their men. Butler, sporting a slightly unruly beard, plays the role as if he\u2019s imitating Mel Gibson during his drunk driving arrest. He\u2019s crude, boorish, and cavalier. Genre mavens will see where Gudegast, who wrote Butler\u2019s last film, \u201cLondon Has Fallen\u201d and is making his feature directorial debut here, is pulling his threads from. The Neal/Vincent dynamic of \u201cHeat\u201d isn\u2019t duplicated here; it\u2019s more like the Chance/Masters dynamic in \u201cTo Live And Die In L.A.,\u201d in which cop and criminal dealt in the same kind of corruption but the criminal was ultimately the more ethically pure of the two. Thing is, though, \u201cDen of Thieves\u201d never really gets that deep, and turns out not to be all that terribly serious a movie anyway. The various character dynamics are almost a smokescreen for a convoluted heist targeting the only bank in Los Angeles that has never been robbed: the branch of the Federal Reserve where, among other things, old money is destroyed around the same time as the serial numbers attached to it are erased.\u00a0 The plot thickens ...\u00a0and thickens ...\u00a0and thickens. Gudegast is clearly an avid student of heist pictures, and he layers this one with a lot of spectacular complications even while he muddles the average viewer\u2019s potential rooting interest. As charismatic as Schreiber\u2019s gangleader and the criminal lieutenant played by Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d Jackson can be (Gudegast engineers a scene involving Jackson\u2019s character\u2019s daughter going on a prom date for a comic-relief \u201cdad gives the date a talking to\u201d scene), they\u2019re still guys who blew away almost a dozen cops in the opening scene, so the suspense when they\u2019re finally inside the Fed building and almost pulling things off is potentially slightly compromised. As for Butler\u2019s Nick, yeah, he\u2019s consistently asking for a spanking to say the least. But where Gudegast really shows his hand, if you\u2019re in the mood to stay ahead of this movie, is in the casting. There\u2019s one character, played by an actor of star-quality charisma, who keeps getting put off to the side in the story, and you have to wonder why. Once you\u2019ve decided why, you can figure out at least one of the twists. And of course, the actor, who I won\u2019t name, is winning enough that you suddenly understand exactly where your rooting interest was supposed to have been all along.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Gimme the Loot", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Somebody's gonna bomb that Apple.\" The Apple in question is the Mets' Citi Field's Home Run Apple, which has never been \"bombed\" by graffiti in its entire history and therefore represents the Holy Grail to New York graffiti artists. If you could somehow get access to that Home Run Apple, and \"bomb\" it, your work would be broadcast to the masses and you'd be a legend! \"Bombing the Apple\" is the lofty goal of Sofia (Tashiana Washington) and Malcolm (Ty Hickson), the two young Bronx graffiti artists in \"Gimme the Loot,\" writer/director Adam Leon's first feature. And what a confident and entertaining first feature it is. Filmed all over the city, it shows a New York that has been missing from American cinema for quite some time. It is an anti-glamorous New York that still exists: grimy delis with cashiers hidden behind plate-glass, black-top parks with ferocious basketball games in progress, the languid crowded torpor of Union Square on a hot summer night. The locations are used offhandedly, although there are a couple of scenes that reach a kind of poetry (one involving a water tower). The characters, sometimes in long-shot, stroll through a cityscape that throbs with a palpable pulse of overpopulation and noise.  Advertisement We don't know much about the home lives of Sofia and Malcolm, although we can assume that things are pretty rough. Roughness, however, does not define them. They spend their time tagging walls and roofs in their neighborhood, coming up with designs, and plotting to raise the $500 that will give them off-hours access to the Home Run Apple at Citi Field. They are engaged in a mild turf war with other graffiti artists, who spray over their designs. They make a great team.  Director Leon said he was inspired by comedies like \"Uptown Saturday Night,\" as well as the Bob Hope/Bing Crosby road movies. Watching Malcolm and Sofia roam around the city, arguing, plotting, harassing each other, but with a clear undercurrent of fondness coursing beneath, is the main delight of the film. The two are accustomed to having to act tough, but there are a couple of electrically tender moments where you get the sense that, really, they should just get it over with and start kissing immediately.  \"Gimme the Loot\" is thrilling, although there aren't any stereotypically \"thrilling\" sequences. The thrill comes from the compulsively watchable dynamic between the two leads (non-professional actors, both of them), the excellent supporting cast (also non-professionals), and the fun use of multiple locations throughout the bustling metropolis. \"Gimme the Loot\" is really about class -- a serious issue, obviously, as the gap between the haves and have-nots widens almost perceptibly. The fact that Sofia and Malcolm view the $500 as nearly impossible to acquire is eloquent.   Malcolm sells dope to finance his work with Sofia. Ty Hickson, a young man born and raised in Harlem, has a beautiful humorous energy, and a visceral openness to the camera, rare in a non-professional actor, but rare with professionals as well. He is emotionally transparent. Watch his face, watch his reactions; he is always listening, always thinking. There is a standout scene where he delivers marijuana to a rich white girl (Zoe Lescaze), lolling about in her parents' apartment. She is bored, mischievous, and wants to talk. As Sofia rages around their Bronx neighborhood far uptown, trying to raise money, Malcolm starts kissing the rich girl, her bed surrounded by a decor of dead bats and creepy skulls (\"You price a skull by the number of the teeth,\" the girl informs Malcolm) and he confesses to Sofia later, \"I fell in love today.\" You believe him. He acts like a stud, but he's not fooling anyone. Sofia, startled, starts lecturing him about condom use, as they cross Union Square.  Advertisement Malcolm may have fallen in love, but he also couldn't help but notice that the rich girl had a glass case on her desk filled with vintage jewelry. This could be the windfall he and Sofia so desperately need. There is one masterfully suspenseful sequence where Sofia is sent to follow the rich girl on her daily run, while Malcolm and an older criminal-type named Champion (Meeko), try to pick the giant lock in the penthouse stairwell to the girl's apartment. Poor Sofia trails after the rich girl on what appears to be an endless run, chasing her across avenues, along the East River, through parks, up and down stairs.  Meanwhile, Champion and Malcolm get off to a rough start because they are not sure what floor they are on. Does the ground floor count as \"1\"? Is the second floor actually the first floor? Champion, covered in tattoos and handsome in an intimidating and tough way, says to Malcolm, \"Okay, let's start from scratch\" and they head back down the stairwell again to count their way back up. Specific details like this one give the film its personality and comedy. Nothing goes smoothly, especially when you dream big.  Although money is the driving force in everyone's lives here (even the rich girl, who dismisses Malcolm in a painful later scene when she is surrounded by her upscale friends), it's the hustle, the \"gimme\" of the title that provides the adrenaline rush, not the loot itself, not even the oasis-mirage of a bombed Home Run Apple being broadcast to Mets fans everywhere.  Adam Leon has created something unique and current, with affectionate nods to New York films of the past. The soundtrack is superb, filled with doo-wop and R&B numbers that soar with nostalgia for a time gone by. His young cast inhabits the world of the film like a well-worn pair of sneakers. \"Gimme the Loot\" is successful on every level, and won the Grand Jury Prize at the SXSW. It is thrilling to contemplate what Leon will do next. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Trophy", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Grown men cry in \"Trophy,\" a documentary about the wildlife hunting  industry. One is a manager at a big game preserve who takes tourists to  shoot African elephants. He's a big, tough-looking fellow, but as he  talks about the emotional bonding that occurs between humans and  animals, he bursts into tears, asks the filmmakers to cut, then leaves  the frame, embarrassed. Another is a wildlife control officer and  dedicated anti-poacher who sometimes has to kill exotic animals anyway  because they're threatening locals or endangering livestock. He seems to  get choked up talking about the experience. \"It's an emotional thing,  killing an animal,\" he says, then goes on to speculate that for hunters,  that emotion, and the accompanying rush of adrenaline, becomes an  addiction that can only be satisfied by shooting more animals. This same  movie starts with a Texas sheep breeder named Phillip Glass (no, not  that one) helping his young son take down first buck. A ritual that may  be horrifying to some is sacred to these two. Later, the father relates a  childhood anecdote: when he was a boy, his mother warned him never to  kill a redbird, and he immediately went out and did it anyway, and as he  stared at the corpse, \"I realized that I could not have loved that  redbird more, even though it was dead.\"  Advertisement Evenhanded is not the  right word for \"Trophy,\" a movie by Shaul Schwarz and Christina Clusiau  (who are also the cinematographers). Though created with the latest  moviemaking technology, including high-definition, lightweight cameras  attached to drones, this is an old school documentary that considers an  issue, the various people involved in it, and the communities and  nations they inhabit. It is not a position paper but a work of curiosity  and intelligence, filled with sublime and horrifying images. Shot with  an ominously gliding camera that revels in the beauty of rhinos,  elephants, lions and other rare animals and scrutinizes the map of each  face that tells a story in front of it, \"Trophy\" strives to be kind and  fair. But it is unmerciful in its exploration of the hunting business.  Like a ruthless lawyer, it loves poking holes in arguments that appear  rock-solid. The mystical-sentimental justifications for  killing penned-in animals are belied by footage of canned hunts\u2014in  particular one that ends with a ranch employee dragging a wounded  crocodile from a man-made lake so that an American hunter can shoot it to death and shout, \"Yeah, motherfucker!\" (Before taking the  kill shot, he pauses to put his beer down on the grass.) But there's  also acknowledgment throughout that you can't just say \"shooting animals  is evil\" and be done with it, because there are too many factors at  play.  One is the existence of multibillion-dollar meat and  egg industries built upon a foundation of prolonged, scientifically  refined forms of torture. Some subjects in \"Trophy\" argue that if the only  way to prevent African big game from going extinct is to transform them  into glorified free-range farm animals, rarer but no less domesticated than sheep or cows, then that's what should be done. \"Give me  [the name of] one animal that went extinct while farmers were breeding  it,\" asks\u00a0South African rhino rancher John Hume. \"There's not one.\" It may seem repugnant to use the profits derived from shooting  animals to protect those same animals, but as Hume says near the start of  the film, after watching his ranch hands drug a rhino and preemptively cut off its horn to make it unattractive to poachers, \"If  [this animal] had an opinion to give you, he would probably say 'I'm  happy to sacrifice my horn to save my life.'\" Advertisement Then there's the  vise-grip of the global marketplace, which drives many poor Africans to  poach for meat or to sell prized trophies (such as rhino horns) on the  black market, where they can fetch a higher price per gram than heroin  or gold. Every decision made in relation to hunting affects someone,  often adversely. The lingering stench of colonialism hovers over every  sentence uttered onscreen.  One long, wrenching sequence in \"Trophy\"  shows a white anti-poacher leading a team onto a nearby farmhouse to  look for a black man suspected of poaching, then intimidating a group of  young suspected poachers by warning them that if they keep doing this,  they could end up getting shot by somebody like him. But the visuals in  these scenes and others are politically charged, in ways that the  filmmakers seem keenly aware of. In Africa, in North America,  everywhere, it's usually white people (on both sides of the issue)  telling black people, often poor ones, what they can or can't do with  wild animals. As sympathetic as we might be towards exotic creatures and  the humans who adore them, it's still chilling to see a beefy white man  barge into a tiny black woman's house in the middle of the night, shine  a flashlight in her face, and force her to lie in the dirt while he  interrogates her. \"He's a bad guy, and he's done bad things,\" the  wildlife officer says of her husband. \"Please don't beat me,\" she asks. The  movie seems like a roughly assembled collection of scenes, arranged in  an \"on the one hand/on the other hand\" manner. But if you pay attention  not just to what's being said but how the film is structured and which sentiments get repeated, you realize that the  filmmakers are building rather masterfully towards a central argument  that encompasses every person and point-of-view.  This entire story is about capitalism run amok. Whatever makes money is going to happen one way or another, no matter what laws are passed, no matter what lofty sentiments are expressed, no matter what justifications people on various sides of an issue give for whatever they believe. What's ultimately at stake here is the question of whether \"the  commodification of wildlife,\" as one activist puts it, is morally much  worse than the commodification of everything else on the planet, including human life\u2014and  whether we need to be less idealistic about solutions, now that we appear  to be barreling towards some kind of global political and environmental reckoning.  The  human species has been altering, processing, consuming and destroying  nature to suit its own ends, often with specious religious or political  justifications, since the dawn of civilization. The technology has just  become more efficient. The recent push to restrict or end hunting is  occurring against the backdrop of a natural landscape that might have  ceased to exist without the subsidies of hunters and people  catering to hunters, the same group whose urge to kill thinned the rhino population from 500,000 in 1900 to about 30,000 today. And some believe that the only way to keep rhinos and other species alive is to continue catering to the same humans who nearly wiped them out.  Advertisement This may seem like a horrendous conundrum, but it's  real, it's not going away, and a good part of the running time of \"Trophy\" is dedicated to  exploring it. Ecologist Chris Packer tells the filmmakers  that he thinks canned hunts are less defensible than the European and  American-dominated safaris that thinned the African game population a  hundred years ago, because prior generations of hunters would track a lone animal through the jungle or across the plains for weeks,  while rich tourists might shoot several animals at once on a ranch, so fast that their beer is still cold when they pose for celebratory pictures. But if  you're killing an animal with a gun, often from so far away that it  doesn't even know you're there, why be incremental with your  condemnation or approval? If rhinos, elephants, lions and the like are  almost certain to be wiped out by poachers if controlled hunting isn't  allowed, then shouldn't societies allow it?  Outside of a safari industry convention in Las Vegas, a protester holds  up a sign that reads \"Killing isn't conservation.\" But it is. The entire  running time of \"Trophy\" is dedicated to examining how both sentiments  can be true. This is a brilliant, maddening, necessary movie.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Starred Up", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "From the very first shot, there\u2019s tension humming underneath\r\nthe phenomenal \u201cStarred Up\u201d that only intensifies as the characters deepen. The\r\nopening shot is shaky, reflecting both movement and the disorientation that\r\ncomes with change. And the eyes of Jack O\u2019Connell, a future star if ever I\u2019ve\r\nseen one, are tight and coiled, first looking down to gather his thoughts and\r\nthen glaring up at the unknown future of his destination. We see this young man\r\ngoing through the process of moving from juvenile care to being admitted to an\r\nadult prison, and it ends with his hands on his head and face. From there, in a\r\nnew cell he\u2019ll occupy for what feels like a long time, he does push-ups, he\r\ncrafts a shiv, he paces like a caged animal\u2014all before a single line of\r\ndialogue. Director David Mackenzie trusts his actor and O\u2019Connell puts more\r\nperformance up there on the screen in body language than most performers do\r\nwith an entire script. It\u2019s almost ten minutes before he speaks (and even that,\r\nto be fair, is so heavily accented and mumbled that I\u2019m not sure I could tell\r\nyou what he says), but we know Eric already through visual composition,\r\nphysical performance, and the other tools that average films often ignore in\r\nfavor of over-expository dialogue and false declarations of emotion. \u201cStarred\r\nUp\u201d is not an average film. Advertisement It\u2019s hard to describe \u201cStarred Up\u201d without making it sound\r\ngeneric. It\u2019s another prison drama, a genre that felt exhausted many, many\r\nyears ago. And it\u2019s another tale of a genetic predisposition for violence as we\r\nsoon learn that Eric\u2019s father Neville (the great Ben Mendelsohn of \u201cThe Place\r\nBeyond the Pines\u201d and \u201cAnimal Kingdom\u201d) is in the same prison as his son.\r\nNeville first spies Eric across the yard and glares him down in the way a\r\ndisappointed parent does before a beating. Eric has been thrown into an ultra-violent,\r\nalpha male world, and it\u2019s not one where having your father around is\r\nnecessarily a good thing. Human connection, for both of these men, will prove\r\nto be a double-edged sword. In many ways, it\u2019s a work about a father\u2019s anger\r\nthat both protects and derails his son.  Eric will have another father figure in his life, a group\r\ntherapist named Oliver (Rupert Friend), who convinces the prison Governor (Sam\r\nSpruell) to give the young man a chance at rehabilitation after a particularly\r\nviolent incident. In group sessions that almost always end in outbursts and\r\nviolence, Oliver does his best to try a different parental tactic with Eric.\r\nThere\u2019s a defining scene in which Eric flouts authority by lighting up a\r\ncigarette in group and Oliver tries discipline\u2014verbal admonition and\r\nessentially putting the group in a \u201ctime out\u201d\u2014before Neville bursts in with the\r\nphysical response: \u201cProblem is you\u2019ve got\r\nto come down on him full throttle; else it won\u2019t register.\u201d It\u2019s corporal\r\npunishment versus detention even in the prison system. The dynamic between a\r\nbiological father and a father figure behind bars is fascinating; both men try\r\nto protect him and both simply cannot in this kind of world. While all of that subtext makes \u201cStarred Up\u201d fascinating, it\r\nis primarily a character piece for the young Mr. O\u2019Connell, an actor who\r\nreminds one of Tom Hardy in \u201cBronson\u201d or the early work of Ryan Gosling in his\r\nfearlessness. There\u2019s a scene early on in which Eric knows the guards are\r\ncoming for him. He races back to his cell, pours oil on the floor, and then\r\ndouses himself in the stuff too. It\u2019ll make it harder to take him down. And he\r\ngrabs a couple of wooden planks for good measure. He\u2019s not getting \u201cout.\u201d They\r\nhave nightsticks, helmets and shields. But he\u2019ll do some damage on his way\r\ndown. \u201cStarred Up\u201d is a film about someone sliding out of society, and kicking,\r\nscreaming and punching as he does so. And O\u2019Connell captures that in a way that\r\nso many more experienced, well-known actors would miss. It\u2019s in the incredible\r\nphysical balance between prison-earned toughness and youth. There\u2019s just a hint of fear in O\u2019Connell\u2019s\r\neyes, reminding us that he was just a kid not that long ago. O\u2019Connell\u2019s\r\nperformance is matched but never upstaged by the increasingly fantastic Ben\r\nMendelsohn, an even more blatantly conflicted blend of rage and familial concern,\r\nand Rupert Friend. Advertisement \u201cStarred Up\u201d is HEAVY with slang and accents. You won\u2019t\r\nunderstand a third of it. But there\u2019s so much going on in between the lines of\r\ndialogue that you won\u2019t care. We\u2019ve seen many visually arresting films in\r\nrecent years and character studies are as common as film festivals, but it\u2019s\r\nthe remarkable blend of the two here that makes \u201cStarred Up\u201d devastating. From Mackenzie\u2019s\r\ncamera choices\u2014often tracking in one shot from relative calm like inmates\r\nplaying ping pong to an outburst in the distance down the hall\u2014to the sound\r\ndesign of clanking metal doors and distant cries, \u201cStarred Up\u201d is a technical achievement\r\nanchored by the clarity of character in O\u2019Connell\u2019s performance.

Nearly.\r\nHaving adored Daly\u2019s wonderful coming-of-age-meets-fairy-tale film \u201cKisses,\u201d I\r\nwas hoping for a bit more of that magic in \u201cBreeze,\u201d and, other than the\r\naforementioned two performances, one has to dig through too many false, forced\r\ncomedy beats to find them here. Advertisement Nan (Flanagan) is a good old-fashioned Irish hoarder. The Dublin\r\nresident has never been much trouble to her neighbors and generally keeps to\r\nherself. Her unemployed son Colm (Pat Shortt) joins forces with his other\r\nfamily members to give Nan a gift she could never give herself\u2014a clean house.\r\nNiece Emma (Thornton) takes Nan out for the day, and they return to a spotless\r\nhome. Old Chinese takeout menus, newspapers, broken kitchen appliances and an\r\noutdated TV: all gone. So is the old mattress Nan has been sleeping on for\r\ndecades. And shoving her money in because she doesn\u2019t trust the banks. That\u2019s\r\nright: there\u2019s a million Euros in a mattress now winding its way through the\r\nDublin recycling system. A wacky journey to find it ensues. Sort of. While \u201cLife\u2019s a Breeze\u201d has an undeniably sitcomish\r\npresence, it\u2019s almost as if the realist in Daly refuses to embrace the\r\npotentially wacky set-up. And so we\u2019re stuck with a film somewhere in the\r\nmiddle. It's not as offensively slapstick-y as it could have been but it's not realism either. It's caught in the boring center of those two ends of the spectrum. To be fair, character beats between Flanagan and Thornton, particularly in the\r\nfinal act, are truly effective. Flanagan has always been a performer who can do\r\na lot with very little, and Thornton has the kind of natural screen presence\r\nthat announces someone on the film scene. She\u2019s the one performer here who\r\ntruly feels in the moment; at least partially because it feels like she\u2019s the\r\none character Daly truly likes. Daly\u2019s skill with slice of life connects in the scenes between\r\nNan and Emma, and they nearly justify the piece in just a few truthful glances. These are two\r\ninteresting characters brought to life by intriguing actresses. Too bad there\r\nisn\u2019t anything in \u201cLife\u2019s a Breeze\u201d to support them.

{"Title": "Welcome to Leith", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "How far do you stretch the definition of acceptance of other\u2019s\r\nbeliefs and free speech? We all like to think that we would allow all\r\ndifferences of opinion, personality, and character to stand, proudly quoting\r\nthe First Amendment as we watch Neo-Nazis march down Main Street. Really think\r\nabout it though. What if your neighbor patrolled the perimeter of his property\r\nwith a loaded shotgun? What if he came to city council meetings and verbally\r\nharassed people to such a degree that nothing was out of bounds, including\r\nmocking the murder of a council member\u2019s daughter? What if he preached hate and\r\nintolerance, and threatened to turn your neighborhood into one of the\r\nfrontlines for the battle for White Power? Would you really live and let live?  Advertisement These were the questions faced by the two dozen (literally,\r\nPopulation 24) residents of Leith, North Dakota, and deftly chronicled in\r\nMichael Beach Nichols and Christopher K. Walker\u2019s unsettling and downright\r\ndepressing \u201cWelcome to Leith.\u201d When Craig Cobb became the 25th\u00a0resident of Leith, it became a national story. At first, no one really noticed\r\nthe grizzled old man who started buying up empty lots in an area of the country\r\ndescribed as \u201cB-roll for The Walking Dead.\u201d\r\nThen Cobb made his presence known, announcing to the other members of the White\r\nPower Movement\u2014for which he had been an outspoken leader\u2014that he was basically\r\ntaking over Leith. He invited people who believed as he did to move to\r\nLeith, hoping to turn the city into a compound for his\r\norganization, dominating votes on the city council and building monuments to his movement. When Cobb\u2019s allies started buying the lots from him, and one\r\nnotable skinhead and his wife even moved in, the locals started to panic. Nichols and Walker are careful to allow Cobb\u2019s words and\r\nactions to demonize him more than their filmmaking. It would have been easy to\r\nsensationalize this story\u2014using true crime documentary camera techniques to\r\nreally turn up the heat on Cobb\u2019s rhetoric. Instead, they merely spent as much\r\ntime with the aggravator as possible, watching him torment people at city\r\ncouncil meetings and swear at his neighbors. They carefully avoid making \u201cWelcome\r\nto Leith\u201d about what Cobb believes in, focusing on how those beliefs impact a\r\ncommunity more than the hatred and vitriol within them. To that end, they\r\nsurprisingly avoid much conversation with the only minority in Leith, who\r\nhappens to be the man who sold Cobb the property in the first place. Other\r\nfilmmakers would have made that the\r\nstory of \u201cWelcome to Leith.\u201d It\u2019s easy to make a documentary about hateful\r\npeople. It\u2019s harder to focus on the impact of hateful people on those around them. To that end, the creators of \u201cLeith\u201d spend an\r\nequal amount of time with Cobb and his cohorts as they do the residents of\r\nLeith, resulting in a notable balance in this portrait of a community. Again,\r\nbeing a strong proponent of free speech, I would never deny Cobb his right to\r\nbelieve what he does, and I find outspoken people like him less terrifying most\r\nof the time than those who hide their disgusting beliefs. At least we know\r\nwhere Cobb is and what he thinks. But Nichols and Walker raise fascinating\r\nquestions about just how much disagreement and hatred we\u2019re willing to accept\r\nfrom our neighbors, and they do so without much flair or over-direction. They\r\nprovide what we hope to get from films about small communities\u2014sketch it in\r\nsuch a way that the local story becomes one in which we can see universal\r\nissues. What happened in Leith could happen in hundreds of small towns across\r\nthe country, and, in many ways, is happening in major ones too, as hateful\r\npeople move in next to those they hate. As the world gets more crowded and\r\nintolerance shows no signs of dissipating, what we will do when we see a bit of\r\nthe drama in Leith in our own cities? Or maybe it's too late to even ask that question. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Trust", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Since the passing of this website\u2019s founder in 2013, this website has reviewed nine films starring Nicolas Cage. I have reviewed one-third of them. No other critic on this website has reviewed more than one. Perhaps you remember the opening line of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cIdiot Wind.\u201d If not, you can Google it. But never mind. The point is, now that I\u2019m reviewing my FOURTH Nicolas Cage movie for this website, I sometimes do think \u201csomeone\u2019s got it in for me.\u201d\u00a0 \n However. I can\u2019t complain too much, not only because nobody really cares anyway but also because this latest Nicolas Cage movie, \u201cThe Trust,\u201d is actually a moderately entertaining heist movie featuring an animated and reasonably diverting Eccentric Cage Performance. The debut feature of brother filmmaking team Alex and Benjamin Brewer, \u201cThe Trust\u201d casts Cage as a seemingly earnest and beleaguered Las Vegas cop. Assembling evidence with his team at a crime scene, he observes \u201cThis is a very interesting ashtray,\u201d before being called outside by a superior officer. Thinking his boss is ready to hear some exciting stuff about his evidence findings, he\u2019s disappointed to find out that the guy just wants him to take a John Deere vehicle off the police auction block so he can make a gift of it to his son-in-law. Las Vegas must be a very movie-friendly city to allow its Finest to be portrayed as such nincompoops.\u00a0 Advertisement \n In any event, Cage\u2019s Stone turns out to not be so honest as that, because upon finding a bail slip showing a certified-check payment on a $200,000 fee to spring a relative criminal nobody, he smells a rat and/or a source of illicit cash. He inveigles his disillusioned, largely stoned-out colleague Waters into a little extra-curricular investigation. What they find\u2014a highly-protected vault overseen by drug dealers, or so it seems\u2014startles and entices them. Soon Stone is on the phone to Cologne, Germany, talking high-tolerance drill bits with experts, consulting his German phrasebook all the while. Things get a little less funny when they get to the spot where they hope to drill around the vault\u2019s security, and find the place occupied by not one but two bystanders.\u00a0 \n Not content to merely be brother filmmakers, the Brewers wear their Coen influence on their sleeves. It\u2019s not just the casting of Cage, but the attempted wryness of the dialogue (\u201cYou can\u2019t walk around dressed like a cop.\u201d \u201cBut I AM a cop,\u201d and so on), the confident visual styling, and more. These elements are pretty entertaining as far as they go, especially when Cage is getting his groove on, as when his character tries to convince Waters that a lemon wedge drizzled with hot sauce is a genuine treat. But certain stuff falls flat: it might have seemed like a quirky move to cast Jerry Lewis in the role of Cage\u2019s father, but the 90-year-old icon is only in the film long enough for you to point to the screen and ask, \u201cIs that Jerry Lewis?\u201d\u00a0 \n And the movie gets a lot less interesting once it starts to go dark, so to speak, and the elements of the story that you had identified as red herrings earlier on turn out to be, yup, red herrings. At this point Cage\u2019s performance has settled into a kind of forced oddness, as in his reading of the line, \u201cI have an idea. It\u2019s kind of \u2026 WACKY.\u201d He says it pretty much exactly as you\u2019d predict.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "I Am Not Madame Bovary", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Director Feng Xiaogang's \"I Am Not Madame\u00a0Bovary,\" with Fan Bingbing as the central character, is not a re-telling of Gustave Flaubert's vicious send-up of the French bourgeoisie. As the male voiceover informs us at the outset, as though he is launching a solemn bedtime story, the film is based on a 17th-century Chinese morality tale about an unfaithful wife named Pan Jinlian who conspires with her lover to kill Pan Jinlian's husband. And ever since that day, \"bad\" women, are referred to as \"Pan Jinlian.\" It is a scarlet letter. The title of the film was apparently chosen because \"Madame\u00a0Bovary\" has the same connotations to Western audiences that \"Pan Jinlian\" does to Chinese audiences. \"I Am Not Madame\u00a0Bovary,\" though, is not about infidelity or the lowly position of women. The real story is about the nature of bureaucracy, and one woman's tireless attempt to go up against The System. This makes the film sound weighty and political, but \"I Am Madame\u00a0Bovary\" plays out as a comedy, a lampoon of the incompetence and laziness of government officials. Advertisement The first scene shows peasant woman Li Xuelian (Fan) visiting her cousin\u2014who knows about legal matters\u2014to ask him what recourse she has in terms of getting a divorce. Her story, rattled off to him, is incredibly complicated, and he looks more and more confused: she and her husband, trying to game the system, faked a divorce, complete with phony divorce papers, so that one of them would be eligible for the apartment they both wanted. The plan was that they would reunite eventually when Li Xuelian got pregnant and then they both could live in that apartment. The husband broke the rules of their plan, however: he fell in love with someone else during this time (treating his \"fake\" divorce as real, in other words), and he and his new \"wife\" moved into the cherished apartment, leaving Li Xuelian out in the cold. Her cousin suggests she present her case to the local court, which she does. They don't get it. (I don't blame them.) She is not put off easily. Her husband has put her in a horrible position and she needs to clear her name. She is no \"Pan Jinlian.\" And so begins her legal journey, as she sues each person who refuses to help her, eventually suing people all the way up to Beijing. She is a royal pain to the various county chiefs and judges and mayors: she races out in front of their cars shouting \"Stop!\", she holds up a sign and sits in the street outside of their offices. She appears at their conferences in Beijing like clockwork. They dread seeing her.\u00a0 The State, as shown in \"I Am Not Madame\u00a0Bovary,\" is not quite as oppressive as Airstrip One in 1984, but it is still a gigantic monolith. The film is crowded with obsequious toadying officials, mediocre bored bureaucrats, and ambitious nobodies covering their asses. They are all men, of course. Despite their power and status, each one eventually throws up his hands in helplessness at her relentlessness. Her behavior doesn't quite equal the absurdities of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the court case spanning generations in Dickens' Bleak House, but it does have a similar almost existential quality. Why won't they just give her what she wants so that they will leave her alone?\u00a0 \"I Am Not Madame\u00a0Bovary\" clocks in at almost two and a half hours, a pretty brutal length for a story so repetitive. Li Xuelian barely has a life outside of her quest. Everything she does is because she wants to clear her name. She has a strange romance with a childhood friend who has pined for her for years, but even within that, she has one goal and one goal only. It's the principle of the thing to her.\u00a0 Feng Xiaogang has chosen a distancing device for his visuals. The rural sections of the film are seen through a circular shape, cutting off the periphery of the screen, giving the impression that we are observing the action through a telescope. Or a rifle-sight. When she gets to Beijing, the circular shape vanishes, and suddenly the frame is a perfect square, representing the much larger world she enters. The circular shape limits the amount of movement possible on the screen, and group scenes in particular suffer because of that. There's a stilted quality to the interactions, and everyone stands in one spot like statues. The intention is to create the effect of an old Chinese painting, the ones seen in the opening of the film underneath the voiceover. This style must have required extreme rigor on the part of everyone involved to keep the action contained enough to stay inside that circle. Much of the film is stunning. These are moments in miniature, seen through a peephole. The color scheme is careful and poetic: watery greens and greys and blurring pinks in the countryside, while Beijing is all gold and red and white. Since much of the film involves Li Xuelian going back and forth from city to country (accompanied by a thrilling percussive score by Wei Du), there is a constant circle-to-square-scene change-up for the action. Feng's style excludes close-ups almost exclusively; the strict framing does not permit it. The overall effect is so distancing that it's as though the characters are at the bottom of a well.\u00a0 There's not an uninteresting or boring shot in \"I Am Not Madame\u00a0Bovary.\" It's a pleasure to look at the screen and to watch the artistry of the entire creative team. But there's a forbidding quality to the entire enterprise. That circular frame is way too small to squeeze through. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Tale of The Princess Kaguya", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Now nearly 80 years old, the Japanese animation director\r\nIsao Takahata has ever forged his own path over the course a half-century of\r\nwork. A legendary perfectionist, the co-founder of Studio Ghibli (also the home\r\nof the great Hayao Miyazaki) has broken molds by, for example, creating an\r\nanimated feature completely lacking in any \u201cfantastic\u201d element, the tender 1991\r\n\u201cOnly Yesterday.\u201d His new film, his first in 14 years, is a staggering\r\nmasterpiece of animation based on a very old Japanese folk tale. \u201cThe Tale of The Princess Kaguya\u201d is both very simple and head-spinningly confounding, a thing\r\nof endless visual beauty that seems to partake in a kind of pictorial\r\nminimalism but finds staggering possibilities for beautiful variation within\r\nits ineluctable modality. It\u2019s a true work of art.  Advertisement The movie begins with a gruff bamboo cutter in a forest. The\r\ncolors are pastel and watercolor; the drawing resembles charcoal sketches.\r\nCutting away at bamboo, the farmer sees a shaft of light; then a plant yields a\r\ndoll-like creature that, once he spirits it off to his cabin to show his wife,\r\ntransforms into a human baby. Despite being in middle age, the wife discovers\r\nshe can feed the baby (the breastfeeding depictions are very matter-of-fact);\r\nthe little girl is growing at an accelerated rate. She soon starts playing with\r\nsome of the males who live in the neighboring area; they nickname her \u201cL\u2019il\r\nBamboo.\u201d The leader of the boys is the slightly older Sutemaru, and all seems\r\nright for L\u2019il Bamboo in the pastoral paradise where she runs and plays and\r\nlaughs and sings a song about the nature of all living beings, a song she can\u2019t\r\nremember having learned but which she\u2019s always known.  Her adoptive pop has other ideas, especially after \u201cthe\r\ngods,\u201d as he believes, bestow a lot of gold upon him; he goes and buys a castle\r\nin the capital, and venture to make the little girl into a genuine princess.\r\nL\u2019il Bamboo\u2019s heart breaks, but she wants to honor her father\u2019s wishes. Here\u2019s\r\nwhere the movie\u2019s story takes a rather infuriating turn. As the girl, soon\r\ngiven the name \u201cKaguya,\u201d is trained and then visited by a quintet of ostensibly\r\nnoble suitors, the story turns into a kind of nightmare of patriarchy. Kaguya,\r\nbright and talented and beautiful, suffers through multiple squelchings of her\r\nown desire, and then acquiesces to the venal wishes of the authority figures\r\nshe loves. The movie is so emotionally roiling because it, too, is of two\r\nminds. It wants Kaguya\u2019s unfettered spirit to have its way, but it also\r\nrecognizes the almost primordial obligation that binds us to family and\r\nconvention. Kaguya\u2019s got her oafish father\u2019s number, and when she stands up to\r\nhim it\u2019s thrilling: \u201cIf I see you in a courtier\u2019s cap I\u2019ll kill myself,\u201d she\r\ntells him calmly at one point. And the father\u2019s ignorance is startling: he\r\ntruly believes that what he\u2019s putting Kaguya through is for her own happiness,\r\nthat this status is something she covets as much as he. Things take an even\r\nmore jarring turn once Kaguya finds out just where she\u2019s from.  Even if you have trouble hooking into the scenario\u2019s\r\ncultural idiosyncrasies\u2014the concerns of this movie, while not \u201cJapanese\u201d in and\r\nof themselves, are addressed in a very specifically Japanese way\u2014every frame of\r\n\u201cPrincess Kaguya\u201d is astonishingly beautiful. What looks rather rudimentary at\r\nthe film\u2019s opening is revealed to have a depth that never stops yielding\r\nbeauty; check out the shadows that fall over the bamboo cutter as he runs from\r\nthe forest with his discovery cradled in his arms. The movement animation of\r\nthe baby \u201cL\u2019il Bamboo\u201d is some of the best depiction of infant development ever\r\nin any medium: so much study, care, and artistry. Creatures both found in\r\nnature (insects, birds) and not (storm clouds that become dragons) are drawn\r\nwith remarkable sensitivity.  I believe the movie is best experienced with its original\r\nJapanese-language soundtrack; its widest release, however, will be in an\r\nEnglish-language dub featuring James Caan voicing the bamboo-cutter, Mary\r\nSteenburgen as the wife, and Chloe Grace Moretz as Kaguya. Due to a screening\r\nsnafu I was able to experience about fifteen minutes of this version and can\r\nreport that it sounds as if these performers honor the material well, so either\r\nway, don\u2019t miss this if you are an animation fan.

{"Title": "Buster's Mal Heart", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The 21st century has not yet produced a whole lot of noteworthy \u201cwhat is reality?\u201d movies, perhaps because we\u2019re too busy wondering \u201cwhat is reality?\u201d in real life to be potentially entertained by a fictional iteration of the question. Or maybe it\u2019s just because David Lynch hasn\u2019t made a feature film in over a decade.  It\u2019s a shame that this movie has a title that sounds like the filmmaker\u2019s dare to any indie distributor\u2019s marketing department, because \u201cBuster\u2019s Mal Heart\u201d is a genuinely noteworthy picture that deserves an audience. Written and directed by Sarah Adina Smith, it\u2019s a movie that puts the viewer into a bad dream, and is very canny in dispensing the keys to unlock the meanings of that dream\u2014and in strategically withholding some of those keys. Advertisement The movie begins with images of a man, the actor Rami Malek (whose popular television show \u201cMr. Robot\u201d might usefully acclimate some viewers to the mind-bending properties of this work) running through a darkening forest. Before we can establish why he\u2019s fleeing, Malek is seen with a long beard and long hair, stealthily breaking into a cozy mountain home while media reports on the soundtrack tell of a \u201chermit\u201d \u201cmountain man\u201d named Buster, a mysterious breaking-and-entering figure who, the announcers insist, is of no genuine threat to the populace at large. And then some scenes depict Malek again, once-more clean shaven, as a married father with professional and personal challenges. He works as a \u201cconcierge\u201d at a corporatized motel, he\u2019s obligated to take on the night shift, he\u2019s thus separated from his wife and daughter, which is on the other hand not too terrible because they\u2019re poor and have to live with his awful moralizing busybody mother-in-law. Sounds stressful, right? It is. The role gives Malek ample opportunity to perform the silent, wide-eyed panic at which he\u2019s practically a virtuoso.  In small dribbles, details of this banal Midwest hand-to-mouth existence emerge. Jonah (for this is the concierge\u2019s name) is married to Marty (Kate Lyn Sheil in a disciplined, enigmatic turn), a former drug addict who\u2019s found God and a church. Jonah himself seems to have less certainty in his philosophy of life. This makes him unusually susceptible to the theories of Brown, who\u2019s played by DJ Qualls with a chilled, spooky quality. Brown shows up at the hotel late one night, without ID or a credit card; he blatantly snorts cocaine in front of Jonah, who tries to throw him out but instead winds up pouring him some drinks from the long-closed bar. \u201cThe better the system, the more of a trap it is for the individual,\u201d Brown avers to Jonah, in the process of spinning out an elaborate prediction of a cataclysmic event called \u201cThe Inversion.\u201d This is tied into Y2K speculation (the film seems to be set in 1999), and also to theories Jonah has been getting from a weird local television program, proposing an interstellar physics that goes \u201cfrom black holes to buttholes.\u201d All this might lead one to believe that Jonah is head for a psychotic break, and that the movie\u2019s intercutting between Jonah and \u201cBuster\u201d are temporal shifts between past and present, depicting one character. Only that\u2019s not where this vision is heading.  Writer/director Smith pulls off her difficult vision with exemplary flair; this is a very accomplished second feature. It\u2019s not without glitches\u2014a scene in which Buster evacuates into a saucepan while a Spanish-language version of the reggae classic \u201cRivers of Babylon\u201d plays on the soundtrack was a little too gross-twee for my tastes\u2014but where it counts, as in a scene in which Buster makes dinner for an older couple that he\u2019s taken hostage in their own home, she imbues her scenes with both conventional suspense and an underlying discomfort that feels like a bad psychic rash. \u201cBuster\u2019s Mal Heart\u201d builds to a conclusion that\u2019s both head-scratching and a little heartbreaking, two qualities that are hard enough to pull off by themselves, let alone simultaneously.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Remember", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Atom Egoyan's revenge thriller \"Remember\" has such a compelling premise and an accomplished cast that it's a shame it doesn't add up to more. Christopher Plummer, still imposing at 86, plays Zev Guttman, a concentration camp survivor who lost his family in World War II to a sadistic Blockf\u00fchrer known as Kurlander, and is now living in a retirement home in New York City. Spurred on by his more frail friend Max (Martin Landau), who informs Zev that the guard is still around and living under an assumed name, he sets off in search of the elusive Kurlander, determined to avenge the great trauma of his life.  Advertisement There are a number of problems with the hero's quest, though, aside from the obvious question of whether two wrongs can make a right. For one thing, Zev is a grieving, at times almost emotionally catatonic-seeming widower who's suffering from what appears to be Alzheimer's (although Egoyan's script never quite comes out and tells us what his issue is medically\u2014it's a King Lear-like \"affliction\"). For another, neither Zev nor the viewers know for certain if Kurlander is really alive or if this tidbit is something dreamed up by Max, who's played by a Landau as an accusing specter who appears to be compensating for his own obvious decline and fear of death by offloading his issues on his a physically capable friend (Max's loved ones were killed by the same guard at Auschwitz). Finally, Max's information is incomplete: we're told that there is a Kurlander, but nobody knows if it's the Kurlander. Which means Guttman is in the position of becoming a mentally-addled human version of the title character in the first \"Terminator\" film: an assassin that set about killing every Sarah Connor in Los Angeles to make sure he eventually got the right one. From such early classics as \"Speaking Parts\" and \"The Adjuster\" through his 1997 masterpiece \"The Sweet Hereafter\" and more obviously pulpy projects like \"Where the Truth Lies\" and \"Devil's Knot,\" Egoyan has always been fascinated by the psychic weight of accumulated time, the elusiveness of justice, and the unreliability of memory. He often fractures his movies into narrative mosaics, flashing back and forth through time and into and out of subjective mental states, so that past and present seem to be occurring on top of each other and we don't always know what we're looking at or what it means. He keeps the structural gamesmanship to a minimum in \"Remember,\" embodying most of the story's instability in Plummer's performance. Is this the right strategy for a tale of pain, revenge and elusive truth, though? Perhaps not. The movie is not pulpy or emotional enough to work as a character study, nor clever and mysterious enough to succeed as a formal puzzle or a grand statement.  Plummer is a focused and detail-oriented actor, and he seems to be giving the movie what it wants: a numbed, aloof, recessive performance that we can project our assumptions and anxieties onto. But considering the emotional power of what Guttman has been through, there are moments when we want more from the character and the film. Egoyan's refusal to give them to us feels like a default art film strategy, mean to make us think there's a lot of nuance and complexity in what is ultimately the story of a probably-demented old man who was implanted with dark thoughts and is now wandering about with murderous intent because he can't figure out what else to do with himself.  Advertisement There's a terrific black comedy buried somewhere in this movie's morose, golden-hued moodiness, but neither the filmmaker nor his cast seem to have much interest in teasing it out. Instead what we get is sincere but glum and evasive, and a bit thin overall. Whether Guttman is bonding with a cute little boy on the train, buying a gun from a pawnshop owner who seems curiously uninterested in Zev's mental frailty and lack of firearms training, looking on as a security guard who's discovered the gun during a routine search compliments his choice of weapon rather than arresting him, or engaging in an unnerving verbal dance with the son of a possible Kurlander (Dean Norris of \"Breaking Bad\"), \"Remember\" doesn't give us much to latch onto.  In time, the Slipperiness of Truth routine starts to feel less like a statement than an abdication of a storyteller's basic responsibilities to the audience, as well as evidence of the film trying to distance itself from any possibility of turning into a Holocaust-themed elder care version of \"Death Wish\"\u2014a lurid notion that might've at least had a disreputable kick. Egoyan has a long history of delivering socko endings that retroactively make the entire story seem to snap into place and add up to more than the sum of its parts, and this movie is no exception.

{"Title": "This Beautiful Fantastic", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Bella Brown (\"Downton Abbey'\"s Jessica Brown Findlay), the central character of writer/director Simon Aboud's \"This Beautiful Fantastic,\" began life as a foundling, left in a box by a river as a baby, hovered over by protective ducks. Raised by nuns, Bella grows up to be a librarian, who harbors dreams of writing a children's book. She also has what appears to be OCD tendencies, but it's twee-movie OCD, an adorable character quirk more than anything else. She's a neat-nik. She is picky about what she eats. Her kitchen cabinets are organized with \"Sleeping With the Enemy\" precision. However, her organizational skills fail her in a couple of areas. She is constantly late to her job at the library, and she has also let the garden behind her rented house fall to ruin. In another movie, this all would seem stressful and dark, but \"This Beautiful Fantastic\" is not meant to be realistic. It's supposed to be a fairy tale. That's fine, but it's a very low-stakes fairy tale, wrapped in a strained garden metaphor. Advertisement \"This Beautiful Fantastic\" has a very small cast, and each male character circles around Bella, wanting only to help her, be near her. Some of these men appear to have nothing else to do in their lives but look out for her, get her out of scrapes, teach her how to live, blossom, grow. The film takes place in a somewhat period-less atmosphere, so it's unclear why she dresses like she's a suffragette in 1912, or a governess in the Edwardian era. Just another one of Bella's quirks, I guess. Her next-door neighbor Alfie (Tom Wilkinson) is an ogre, a semi-terrifying Scrooge, growling at her from over the fence. He's the one who calls the authorities to report the jungle of weeds that is her backyard. Bella is given a month to turn that jungle into a proper garden or she will be thrown out into the streets. Alfie's personal cook, a charming Irishman named Vernon (Andrew Scott), jumps ship from the mean old man to cook for Bella, even though she has no money to pay him. He's a father of two. Why would he give up a paying job for a non-paying one? You're not supposed to ask questions like this, but they were unavoidable. Vernon wanders around, carrying serving trays of food, giving Bella pep talks. He commandeers her kitchen. (Bella is constantly being over-ridden by everyone she meets, told what to do, where to go, who to be. She doesn't appear to mind.) At the library, Bella is drawn to a patron, a befuddled and adorable inventor named Billy (Jeremy Irvine). They bond over books, he shows her a mechanical bird he created. Bella says of him later, \"He invents mechanical animals and he makes me feel like I can fly.\"\u00a0 This kind of thing was done more effectively in \"Amelie\" (the film's clearest influence), or \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" another love story taking place in a timeless technology-less universe. The adorable heroine who inspires everyone she meets to do better, be better, who inspires a feeling of love and protectiveness in even crotchety old men, is as old as the hills (although usually it's a child\u2014like Anne Shirley, or Shirley Temple\u2014who melts the hearts of entire communities, not a grown woman.) Bella, except for her attention-getting outfits, doesn't register as that kind of character at all. Yes, she piles her peas into the corner of her plate, she needs a lot of help to do everything (garden, cook, get to work on time), she checks the lock 20 times before she leaves the house, but that doesn't make her seem remotely like a real person. (It's also hard to picture her writing anything that would be of interest to anyone.) The threatened eviction is an obvious device used to heighten the time crunch, and the garden metaphor wears out its welcome almost immediately. Fairy tales don't need to be realistic. There is charm and humor in all of the performances. But if you keep thinking, as I did, \"Wait, doesn't Vernon have two daughters he needs to support? How is he making a living?\" or \"Can't she just hire a gardener for two days to hack the weeds away?\" or \"Why is everyone in this film devoting their whole lives to making Bella blossom like those seeds she plants?\" then clearly something is not working.

{"Title": "Man Down", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "PTSD is a real, national crisis. It is something that is not openly discussed enough nor adequately handled by our government and those in charge of taking care of our veterans. The number of homeless vets and those suffering from PTSD in silence should be a priority for a country that wants to call itself civilized. None of these facts make Dito Montiel\u2019s \u201cMan Down\u201d a good film. Actually, the fact that it uses PTSD as a hook, as something to give its drama a sense of weight and importance that it doesn\u2019t otherwise earn, is one of its many problems. If you\u2019re going to make a film about PTSD, treat it with the respect it demands, not as a clich\u00e9d, melodramatic device. By doing so, one actually damages the cause they claim to be attempting to defend, turning something serious into something manipulative. \u201cMan Down\u201d is a bad film, but it\u2019s made even worse by the taste it will leave in your mouth regarding its silly handling of a very serious issue. Advertisement Montiel's latest takes place in what appears to be four separate periods in the life of Marine Gabriel Drummer (Shia LaBeouf). We see him with his buddy Devin (Jai Courtney) in a post-apocalyptic future, as the pair tries to track down Gabriel\u2019s son Johnathan (Charlie Shotwell), crossing paths with a drifter named Charles (Clifton Collins Jr.), who may know where the boy has been taken. The landscape they cross is desolate and empty. Where are they? What happened to Johnathan? What happened to everyone else? It's purposefully vague and confusing. We flash back to basic training, featuring scenes so dense with military clich\u00e9s they should have all been set to \u201cFortunate Son.\u201d Working slightly better as drama, we experience an extended conversation between Gabriel and a superior, played by Gary Oldman, that seems to take place after the young man has become a Marine but before the world ends. This scene as a whole is far and away the film's best as it escapes the plot and allows the two actors some semblance of character. Without it, the movie would verge on unbearable. And then we flash back further to Gabriel\u2019s life just before joining up, in which we meet his wife Natalie (Kate Mara) and enrich the bond between Gabriel and his son. The haphazard, choppy editing of \u201cMan Down\u201d is designed in such a way to replicate the confusion and twisted reality associated with PTSD, but its effect is opposite in that it feels entirely like cheap, manipulative devices instead of anything insightful about the human condition. \u201cMan Down\u201d is one of those scripts that plays games with viewer awareness, forcing us to ask what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not, and keeping a mystery what happened to Gabriel\u2019s son or while he was serving our country. Consequently, there are no real people in \u201cMan Down.\u201d There are no characters. There are merely cogs in the plot device machine.  Advertisement The sad thing is that LaBeouf does admirable work to try to correct for the lack of depth in Adam G. Simon and Montiel\u2019s script. He commits to the role completely, never betraying the film\u2019s shallowness or clich\u00e9s, and trying his best to find something worthwhile in terms of character. He makes some decisions in the extended scene with Oldman that totally work. He looks like a broken man, cracking from the inside out. There\u2019s a good LaBeouf performance buried deep in this film, and it almost makes the clich\u00e9s around it more frustrating because of the honest work they smother. Montiel has proven himself an interesting filmmaker when it comes to analyzing the alpha male in films like \u201cA Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\u201d and \u201cFighting,\u201d but he never figures out the right approach for \"Man Down.\" At times, the dialogue is so clich\u00e9d\u2014\u201cThis area\u2019s secure.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re at war, Marine. Nothing\u2019s secure.\u201d\u2014that it approaches parody, and I wondered if that wasn\u2019t intentional. There\u2019s a flashback in which the Marine buys his kid a puppy; the basic training scenes could have been written by a teenager who\u2019s seen too many military movies. And so on. Sadly, it\u2019s more likely just an example of people trying to handle a delicate, complex subject, but falling back on the devices instead of really tackling the material. Clich\u00e9s are easy. Manipulating audiences is easy. Really addressing a national crisis takes the kind of guts that \u201cMan Down\u201d just doesn\u2019t have.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "A Fantastic Fear of Everything", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Jack (Simon Pegg) is a writer. Or, he was. He wrote a popular children's\r\n book about a sensitive hedgehog named Harold. He blames that book for \r\nruining his marriage. When \"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" opens, Jack \r\nis currently working on a project called \"Decades of Death\", a study of \r\nVictorian-era serial killers, the \"Golden Age of murder\". He cannot \r\nleave his flat in Hackney. He sleeps clutching a knife. Jack is afraid \r\nof everything, of being murdered, of launderettes, of eyeballs, of \r\nChristmas carolers, of the telephone ringing, and every other casual \r\nthing that comes up in life.\n\r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\", directed by Crispian Mills (with \r\nanimation sequences directed by Chris Hopewell), is a fascinating and \r\nuneven horror-comedy, strange and ambitious, anchored by a tour de force\r\n performance by Simon Pegg. Pegg, obviously, is well-known to fans of \r\nEdgar Wright's films, as well as his appearances in blockbuster \r\nfranchises like \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Star Trek\", but here, he is \r\nbasically given a one-man show. He is in every scene, clad in filthy \r\nunderpants and an open silk robe. He is a phenomenal physical actor. \r\nWatching him work is the primary pleasure of \"A Fantastic Fear of \r\nEverything.\" Similar to \"Barton Fink,\" another hallucinogenic story of a\r\n writer haunted by his own unfinished projects and lost opportunities, \r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" examines the creative process as seen \r\nthrough the eyes of a writer gone completely mad.\n\r\nJack is a wreck when the film opens, and his condition deteriorates from\r\n there. Fleeing from shadows in his own gloomy flat, it is hard to \r\nbelieve that Jack was ever together enough to have had any success as a \r\nwriter, let alone be someone's husband. \"A Fantastic Fear\" is best when \r\nit explores what it is like inside a paranoid mind, a man so bewildered \r\nby the simple tasks of life (\"I've never bought a toilet roll!\" he cries\r\n in a panic to his agent) that he cannot leave his house.\n\r\nThe first half of the film features Jack gearing up for a lunch with his\r\n agent (deliciously played by Clare Higgins), and then the fallout from \r\nthat meeting, where she tells him a producer from Hollywood is \r\ninterested in his \"Decades of Death\" project. All he needs to do, the \r\nonly thing, is put on a suit and meet the guy for dinner. But once he is\r\n back in his flat, the hallucinations take over again, and he becomes \r\nconvinced that the Hollywood guy is somehow related to one of the grisly\r\n Victorian murderers on his wall. At any rate, the situation goes south,\r\n and his panic is exacerbated by the fact that he does not own a suit, \r\nhis socks are filthy, and he is afraid of going to the laundromat. Mills\r\n and the production design team pull out all the stops in the first \r\nhalf, filming Pegg in a distorted and fantastical way, so that never \r\nonce are we outside his delusional viewpoint. Shadows loom around Jack \r\nand cloaked figures seem to float at the end of the dark hallway. Six \r\ninnocent Christmas carolers on the stoop are filmed as though they are \r\nportents of evil doom. As awful as the situation is for Jack, Pegg is so\r\n funny and so committed to the performance that the psychotic break \r\nbecomes hugely entertaining.\n\r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" goes off the rails in its second half, \r\nwhen Jack ventures out to wash his socks, shirt, and underpants at a \r\nlaundromat. He is so frightened that the fellow customers at the \r\nlaundromat stare at him with what seems to be hostile intent. The \r\nsituation, which starts out humorously (made even more so by the fact \r\nthat Jack has accidentally Super-glued his huge knife to his hand), \r\ndrags on so long it becomes actually interminable. It is as though once \r\nJack leaves his flat, so rich with psychodrama horror-movie potential, \r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" doesn't know what film it wants to be \r\nanymore. There are still some very funny moments, and the script is \r\noften hilarious. Only Simon Pegg could make the screamed comment \"This \r\nis a CELLAR\" funnier with every repetition.\n\r\nAs the film galumphs awkwardly towards its ending, with flashes of \r\nvisual brilliance like intermittent lightning, events start to dovetail,\r\n and there are scenes with a Freudian psychiatrist (wearing an eyepatch \r\nand a pirate's hat), and a pretty girl who shows up at the laundromat \r\n(Amara Karan, well-known for her performance as Rita, or \"Sweet Lime\", \r\nin Wes Anderson's \"The Darjeeling Limited\"), as well as an actual serial killer on the loose who just wants to be loved because \r\nhe was abandoned as a child. The film is too cynical to play any of this\r\n sentimentally: the \"wounded inner child\" sub-plot is obviously supposed\r\n to be snarky and ironic, and it is. But the film is haunted by its \r\nsuperior first half.\n\r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" is not, actually, fantastic, but it was\r\n inventive enough to hold my interest, weird enough to be intriguing, \r\nand bold in some of its visual experiments. At the center of it all is \r\nSimon Pegg; terrified and manic, talking to himself, racing around in \r\nstained Fruit of the Looms, kitchen knife glued to his hand. It is a \r\ncompelling and comedic portrait of creativity, obsession, and psychosis. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Young Ones", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "I don\u2019t want to come off like some kind of inverse snob, but\r\nI\u2019ve got to say, given the circumstances of his birth and upbringing,\r\nwriter-director Jake Paltrow strikes me as the Least Qualified Person To\r\nEnvision A Dystopian Sci-Fi Future Ever. You may infer the circumstances of\r\nPaltrow\u2019s birth and upbringing by his name, I reckon. In any event,\r\nqualifications notwithstanding, he has nevertheless opted to imagine and film\r\nsuch a story, one that bears out my hunch.  \u201cYoung Ones\u201d (there really isn\u2019t anything in the movie that\r\nmakes this bland title pop) takes place in an unnamed portion of the Western\r\nUnited States at a time when water is very scarce, and chronicles a sort of\r\nland-war-by-subterfuge in which the main players are Michael Shannon\u2019s haunted\r\npatriarch, Nicholas Hoult\u2019s ambitious young-man-on-the-make (for several items,\r\nincluding Elle Fanning\u2019s character, Shannon\u2019s daughter) and Kodi Smit-McPhee\u2019s\r\nobservant, sensitive son-of-Shannon. In Paltrow\u2019s future, water is a commodity\r\nnot unlike oil. But the former farmers of the now-desert in which Shannon\r\nroams, first with a live donkey, then with a robot replacement, are not nearly\r\nas stressed as ordinary mortals in danger of imminent dehydration might be in\r\nthe real world. Indeed, Paltrow\u2019s near-dystopia (there is still a central\r\ngovernment and a semblance of civilization, including used-car dealerships, in this\r\nworld) is one of the most decorous you\u2019ll ever see. Even the most thirsty and\r\ndesperate look pretty good most of the time. And the color coordination! At one\r\npoint, Aimee Mullins, playing a mom with a new robotic spinal cord, tunes into a\r\nvideo-streaming funeral, at which the attendees are all dressed in blue-grey\r\nclothes, the better to blend in with the blue-grey rock formation behind them.\r\nSeriously, this movie makes \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d look like \u201cThe Road Warrior.\u201d  Advertisement Paltrow, whose previous directorial feature was the somewhat\r\nmore apt 2007 showbiz romcom \u201cThe Good Night,\u201d is an attentive student of\r\ncinema, as his mini-homages to the likes of Antonioni and Lucas in this story\r\ntestify. But his story is a veritable nothingburger, here and there recalling notes\r\nfrom the likes of \u201cGiant\u201d and \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d but never really\r\nconnecting on levels emotional or intellectual. One would like to say the cast\r\ndoes its level best, but, to be brutally honest, the footage assembled doesn\u2019t\r\ndepict them doing a whole lot more than squinting, and looking lanky in clothes\r\nthat, again, aren\u2019t inordinately suitable for desert living, unless it\u2019s GQ\u2019s\r\nidea of desert living. Viewers who make it to the end will be confused or\r\ninfuriated but likely not delighted by the faux-Wes-Anderson curtain-call end\r\ncredits.

{"Title": "Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds stand side-by-side on a red carpet. The occasion is the third auction of the items in Reynolds' awe-inspiring collection of Hollywood memorabilia. A reporter asks, \"What is it that connects you two off the red carpet?\" Fisher answers, \"We are always on a red carpet. We have red carpets connecting our homes.\" That last part is an exaggeration, but only slightly. Fisher and Reynolds lived next door to one another for decades. They took their red carpet with them wherever they went. The blessing and curse of fame. This unique relationship is the subject of \u201cBright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,\" directed by Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens. It will be airing on HBO\u00a0on Saturday night. Advertisement The documentary premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, and then played at Telluride and the New York Film Festival, initially as a tender, human, and very, very funny portrait of Hollywood royalty. And then came the horrible news of Carrie Fisher's death at age 60 from a heart attack, and\u2014before anyone had a chance to take a breath\u2014the news of Reynolds' death at age 84. According to Todd Fisher, Carrie's brother, Reynolds said before dying that she \"wanted to be with Carrie.\" \"Bright Lights\" now makes its HBO premiere directly into the immediate shock waves of industry and fandom grief. \"Bright Lights\" opens with a montage of home movie footage: young Carrie and Todd Fisher in matching outfits, young Debbie Reynolds, with her husband Eddie Fisher (who, famously, left the family to marry Elizabeth Taylor), as Fisher and Reynolds have a conversation in voiceover. They bicker (Fisher: \"This is getting so ugly so fast\"), but in such a rapid-fire humorous way that it sounds like well-oiled schtick. It IS schtick, but it's not a retread of somebody else's tired routine. This routine is theirs, and theirs alone. Listening to it now is almost unbearably touching. There's a moment late in the film when Fisher and Reynolds, collapsed together on the couch, do a spoken-word version of \"There's No Business Like Show Business,\" making it sound like an impromptu conversation. It's an extraordinary scene (not to mention hilarious), and an encapsulation of the relationship, the way they picked up on each other's cues via extra-sensory sensitivity, setting each other up for punch lines gracefully, like the two old pros that they were. The documentary was shot mostly during 2014 and 2015, busy years for both women. (There's one extraordinary scene from 2010, when Fisher visits her father on his death bed.) Fisher was preparing to go film \"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,\" working out with a trainer as per LucasFilm's request, and Reynolds\u2014against her daughter's advice\u2014was still booking gigs in Las Vegas and elsewhere, despite the fact that she was feeling ill. Reynolds received the SAG Lifetime Achievement Award during this time, and there was also the third auction of her gigantic Hollywood memorabilia collection, which she attended with her children. Advertisement \"Bright Lights\" gets so much done that it's hard to believe it's only 95 minutes long. The documentary includes mini career retrospectives of both Reynolds and Fisher, with movie clips and commentary from both. There are interviews with both women, and they talk about their lives and careers but most of all, of course, they talk about each other. Fisher expresses worry about her mother's health, saying: \"Everything in me demands that my mother be as she always was. She just can't change. And she's fucking with me.\" These words now have a haunting echo. The devotion to preserving Reynolds' collection of Hollywood memorabilia (Dorothy's ruby slippers, Marilyn Monroe's \"subway-grate\" dress from \"The Seven Year Itch,\" to name a few) was a family activity, and all of them well up with tears of outrage and pain when they speak of the fact that nobody in the industry was interested in preserving the history Reynolds had collected, at least not interested enough to put up the money for a museum. Auctioning off those items was like cutting off a limb. At the last minute, Reynolds decides that she cannot part with the \"Rat Pack suits,\" saying, \"I love my ghosts. I love having memories. It's like having a friend forever.\" To those unaware of Reynolds' passion for collecting and preserving, \"Bright Lights\" serves as a beautiful reminder. There are echoes of \"Postcards from the Edge,\" (the book and screenplay written by Fisher) throughout, although with a softer, more forgiving edge. Fisher admits that she wrote the book at a very angry time in her life. Watching the elderly Debbie Reynolds, in her heavy-beaded gown, surrounded by helpers, walk up and down the stairs to the stage, was an image of show business professionalism that is a total inspiration. She was a woman who came up in a brutal studio system, who loved entertaining people, and was still\u00a0out there doing it, even though the crowds now were smaller and older. Despite her worries, Fisher understands why Reynolds needed to keep performing: \"Performing gives her life. It feeds her in a way family cannot.\" One of the most powerful impressions I got from Reynolds in \"Bright Lights\" was that her cheerfulness was not naivete, ignorance or shallowness. Her cheerfulness was a choice. Her cheerfulness shows how tough she was. Her cheerfulness helped her survive, in the same way that Fisher's humor helped her survive. Any time a celebrity dies and fans mourn publicly, the usual suspects show up to scold and mock (\"You didn't even know this person.\" \"In such a serious world, THIS is what you care about?\" etc.). Or, in a particularly egregious example, harass Steve Martin\u2014a man who knew and loved Carrie Fisher in real life\u2014for not expressing his Tweet-grief in a way that they thought appropriate. It was not anyone's finest hour. What these scolders don't understand is that celebrities\u2014or icons\u2014really matter\u00a0to their fans in ways intense and personal. In many cases, it is a personal loss. There's a moment in this film at a comics convention when a fan, getting Fisher's autograph, dissolves into tears right at the table. There's another moment when Reynolds comes out of the stage door after her show in Vegas, and a middle-aged male fan standing right there waiting for her, blurts out, \"I love you!\" Of course he does. Millions did. Love like that often represents the best part of us, because it's pure, and it comes from a place of gratitude, gratitude that these generous women have shared themselves with us, have given us so much. \"Bright Lights\" would have been entertaining even if both women had still been with us. But now, so sadly, it takes on whole other layers of meaning and impact. Tribute and mourning are often one and the same thing. They are within \"Bright Lights.\" Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Manglehorn", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "David Gordon Green continues to focus on character studies,\r\nas he did with \u201cPrince Avalanche\u201d and \u201cJoe,\u201d but the results this time are decidedly\r\nmore frustrating than those superior efforts. Just as \u201cJoe\u201d often felt like a vehicle\r\nto rehabilitate the oft-mocked career of Nicolas Cage in the last decade or so,\r\n\u201cManglehorn\u201d sometimes feels designed to remind us that Al Pacino is still one\r\nof our greatest actors. OK. Point taken. Now what? While \u201cJoe\u201d built an\r\ninteresting film around Cage\u2019s performance, Green leaves Pacino adrift in \u201cManglehorn,\u201d\r\nand the result is a disappointing, shambling piece of melancholy with a few\r\ninteresting scenes here and there that never cohere in such a way that allows the legendary actor to disappear into the character. Advertisement Pacino plays an eccentric locksmith named Manglehorn who lives in a small Texas town by himself. He\u2019s estranged from his financially successful son Jacob\r\n(Chris Messina), has few real friends outside of his cat, and writes letters to\r\nthe love of his life who got away many years ago. A highlight of his meager existence seems\r\nto be the occasional visit to the local bank to see the lovely teller Dawn\r\n(Holly Hunter), but when he\u2019s given a chance to turn that into something\r\ngreater, he fumbles. Manglehorn has allowed anger, regret and depression to push him into isolation in his later years. He doesn\u2019t have\r\nmuch left outside of his key-making business, and that basically just gives him\r\nanother reason to be alone in his shop.  On one level, Paul Logan\u2019s script is defiantly episodic:\r\nManglehorn talks to his son, he runs into an acquaintance (played in a\r\nremarkably aggravating style by Harmony Korine), he flirts with Holly Hunter,\r\netc. While \u201cManglehorn\u201d could have been a character study, a slice of reclusive\r\nold age in modern America, Logan and Green layer their film with poetic\r\nself-importance, mostly in Manglehorn\u2019s letters and inner monologues, complete\r\nwith lines like \u201cI\u2019m losing hope in tomorrow.\u201d\r\nIt feels false, like a degree of self-understanding that only comes in motion\r\npictures or bad fiction. And that dishonesty carries over to scenes between\r\nManglehorn and his son, especially a dinner between the two that\u2019s just too\r\npoorly written for Pacino and Messina to save it. Every shot of Manglehorn\u2019s grizzled face is weighted with\r\nunearned gravitas, the kind that comes with designing a film around an\r\nactor instead of a character or a narrative. It feels like the first draft was\r\ncalled \u201cAl Pacino is Still a Hell of an Actor.\u201d And that showcase is constantly\r\npushing against the film\u2019s realism. There\u2019s a scene late in the film between\r\nPacino and Hunter that really should work\u2014she\u2019s great in it\u2014in which Dawn\r\nrealizes that Manglehorn\u2019s enclosed life is one that she may not want to enter,\r\nbut Pacino and Green can\u2019t figure out how to play the moment. Pacino practically\r\nclimbs on a soapbox to deliver a monologue, when it should be about a man\r\nafraid and tentative to re-enter the real world of human relationships. At its best, \u201cManglehorn\u201d is a surprisingly deep conversation\r\nwith an old friend on a twilight Southern evening. It\u2019s about those times in\r\nour lives when we reassess past mistakes and consider the diminishing hours we\r\nhave left on this planet. I only wish the film allowed that conversation to\r\nflow naturally with a well-rounded character instead of reminding us over and over again that we\u2019re\r\ntalking to the one and only Al Pacino.

{"Title": "In Order of Disappearance", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The body count that Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's taciturn snowplow-operating Nils Dickman racks up in Hans Petter Moland's revenge-thriller-comedy \"In Order of Disappearance\" almost makes Dirty Harry look like a softie. Liam Neeson wreaking havoc around the world after his daughter is kidnapped yet again in the \"Taken\" franchise seems like a slacker in comparison. Nils is a gloomy civil servant just voted \"Citizen of the Year\" for his tireless devotion to keeping the roads clear. When his son turns up dead from an apparent drug overdose, he knows it was murder, and, in trying to track down who did the deed, unveils a web of international drug-runners operating out of the tiny nearby airport in the isolated snowy middle of nowhere. Nils sets out to kill whoever was responsible. He is as unstoppable as his snowplow. Advertisement As Nils discovers the scope of this thing, he works his way to the top, because whoever is at the top is the one who really needs to pay. Each person who dies gets their own little epitaph screen, operating like a cynical little chuckle as Nils checks the name off the list. Maybe the cynical chuckle is Moland's. It's a fun device the first three or four times it occurs, but the joke becomes increasingly rote as it goes on. The fun of the film (and it is often fun) is in the complexities of interconnections, and the sheer number of criminals raging through this tiny area, outnumbering the upstanding citizens by the looks of it. All of the secondary characters, the bumbling cops, the warring drug dealers, their families, their rivals, are all broad caricatures played by a very funny cast of character actors. Somebody\u00a0is killing them all off one by one and everyone points the finger at everyone else, never once suspecting that that hunched-over guy at the wheel of the snowplow is the murderous maniac responsible. The head honcho in the area is Greven (P\u00e5l Sverre Hagen). Greven is a flamboyant villain, a childish psychopath who also happens to be a ponytail-wearing militant vegan. He is sure that it's the Serbians doing the killings (he keeps referring to them as Albanians, and is enraged when corrected). Greven has his goons go after the Serbians, the Serbians retaliate, the epitaph credit-screens pile up. Some of the \"bits\" in the film are full-on farcical, and some have a wintry dry wit. Others feel improvisational, like Greven spluttering at his wife: \"You think you know me! But you don't fool me, with your fucking hipster mittens!\" Cinematographer Philip \u00d8gaard captures the white-out conditions of \"In Order of Disappearance\" in ways haunting and eerie. He has a good eye for the weird and specific: the gravestones jutting up out of the endless expanse of white, the blue-white snow at night with Nils' snowplow light cutting its way through the darkness, plumes of snow billowing off to the side. \"Fargo\" might come to mind, but this snowy wilderness is different, harsher. Nils wraps the dead bodies in chicken wire and dumps them over a roaring waterfall plunging into an icy river below. This is Skarsg\u00e5rd's third collaboration with Moland (\"Aberdeen,\" and \"A Somewhat Gentle Man\" being the other two), and he's really not given much to do. He's a blank-faced killing machine. Nils remains a completely undeveloped character, although character development is clearly not what Moland was after. Moland was after the humor concept of a bunch of drug lords fighting over who gets to deliver cocaine to a tiny patch of snow. It's as if Quentin Tarantino went to the Arctic Circle. The character of Nils certainly can't compete with the eccentric secondary characters, the Serbian goombahs snarling with rage over the battle of Kosovo (which went down in 1389) and Greven downing a vegan smoothie as he screams at his second-in-command. The killings are creative and brutal, but eventually, the whole structure of it, with the epitaphs announcing the deaths \"in order of disappearance\"\u2014becomes an empty and slick exercise in style.

Or, for\r\nthat matter, not being the movie of that description that you might want. The\r\ngreat based-on-a-true-story journalism movie of the last 65 or so years was, of\r\ncourse, \u201cAll The President\u2019s Men,\u201d chronicling the determined search for truth\r\nconducted by crusading reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The\r\nWashington Post. One of the distinguishing features of \u201cKill The Messenger\u201d is\r\nthat The Washington Post figures in the narrative as one of the bad guys.  Advertisement Directed by Michael Cuesta (\u201cL.I.E.,\u201d \u201cRookie,\u201d and, most\r\npertinently, episodes of\u00a0 \u201cHomeland\u201d)\r\nfrom a script by Peter Landesman (the writer/director of \u201cParkland,\u201d who\r\nhimself has a considerable background in investigative journalism), and\r\nstarring Jeremy Renner, who is also an executive producer, \u201cMessenger\u201d is about\r\nGary Webb, a feisty reporter for the San Jose-Mercury News who seems to be\r\nhaving a grand old time writing about drug dealers who are getting their houses\r\nillegally confiscated by the government. His wife (Rosemarie De Witt) tolerates\r\nthe haphazard lifestyle such an occupation brings, up to a point; when the\r\nhotsie-totsie girlfriend of an accused trafficker drops off a package of files at\r\nWebb\u2019s home, the missus alludes to some past trouble in the marriage. Turns out\r\nthe hotsie-totsie (amusingly incarnated by Paz Vega) is kind of using Webb as a\r\ncat\u2019s paw, but in so doing, she throws either the story of a lifetime, or a\r\nlive grenade, or both, into his lap: information pointing to a government\r\ninvolvement in the crack cocaine trade, a byzantine arrangement by which the\r\nC.I.A. was able to fund Ronald Reagan\u2019s Contras by either looking the other way\r\nat, or deliberately engineering, drug-money-for-arms transactions. Interviewing\r\na big-shot dealer in a Central American jail (Andy Garcia), that dealer recalls\r\na meeting with one \u201cOllie.\u201d \u201cOliver North?\u201d Webb asks, a little stunned. \u201cNo,\r\nOliver Hardy, \u201c the prisoner says. \u201cOF COURSE Oliver North.\u201d  Despite the warnings of a D.C. bureaucrat (Michael Sheen)\r\nwho suggests that characterizing the realm Webb is exploring as a \u201crabbit hole\u201d\r\nwould perhaps be an extremely dire understatement, Webb convinces his editors\r\nto run his story. Initially hailed as a hero, Webb is soon met with\r\noverwhelming skepticism. Papers such as The New York Times and The Washington\r\nPost, with \u201cwho is this upstart?\u201d indignation, start picking at aspects of the\r\nstory, and then at Webb himself. The trouble to which Webb\u2019s wife had alluded\r\nto returns to bite him and his family in the ass, hard. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make\r\nit about you,\u201d Sheen\u2019s character predicted. Boy, do they ever. The movie is, in\r\nits details, relatively discreet about laying blame but fairly definite in\r\ndepicting a media culture now so entrenched in the establishment that it\r\ndoesn\u2019t even have to be coerced into serving the interests of the powerful.\r\nThat the filmmakers are able to pursue their theme to the extent that the true\r\nstory on which the film is based obliges them to somehow has to be credited to\r\nRenner. His performance is very good, despite the somewhat stereotypical bro\r\ncharacteristics with which the Webb character is here endowed. Around the\r\nmid-point of the movie, I noted that the material was sufficiently compelling\r\nthat, say, the montage of Renner tooling around on a motorcycle being all\r\nstressed out was kind of beside the point. In light of the picture\u2019s finale,\r\nthat sort of thing made slightly more sense, but still carried an aura of\r\nspecial pleading.  That said, it\u2019s a minor quibble relative to the pretty\r\nsubstantial points the movie\u2019s making. The death of print and the death of\r\njournalism are two different phenomena, but they\u2019re not unrelated; if you\u2019re\r\nof the opinion that it\u2019s all because of the Internet, well, \u201cKill The\r\nMessenger\u201d has some perhaps disturbing news for you\u2014about the news you are now\r\ngetting, and the news you are now not getting.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Girl with All the Gifts", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In many ways, Melanie (Sennia Nanua) is just another ordinary girl. She goes to school every day, where she\u2019s grown affection for her teacher Ms. Justineau (Gemma Arterton). And she\u2019s at that age where she\u2019s figuring out what\u2019s important to her, and how to navigate through the world of adults around her. But Melanie is not an ordinary girl. She will soon be a mindless, soulless zombie, a braindead creature who responds only to a desire to kill and eat people around her. In fact, with the right triggers\u2014like if the adults around her forget to wear their scent-disguising lotion\u2014she could become that right now. Just when you thought the zombie genre was out of ideas, along comes Colm McCarthy\u2019s smart and engaging \u201cThe Girl with All the Gifts,\u201d a film with echoes of George A. Romero, Danny Boyle, and Robert Kirkman but one that also feels confidently its own creation, a unique take on responsibility, adulthood, and a new chapter in evolution. Advertisement Melanie isn\u2019t alone. She lives with a number of other zombie-children like her in a bunker beneath a military facility, where she\u2019s being studied and experimented on by Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close), in the hope that they could provide the antidote for what has essentially ended normal human existence. Melanie is one of several second-generation flesh-eaters called \u201chungries,\u201d babies who literally ate their way out of their parents but are not behaving in precisely the same way as the brain-dead speedsters that have destroyed humanity. Whenever a child is found in the wild, they\u2019re taken to this facility, where Dr. Caldwell can experiment on them and Sgt. Eddie Parks (Paddy Considine) can work to control them. Said control involves leg, arm and head restraints whenever the children are anywhere near that oh-so-enticing human flesh. But Melanie seems so normal and is clearly learning empathy. The good doctor sees that as well, and even starts to loosen some of the restraints keeping Melanie more of an object than a person. Then one day Dr. Caldwell comes for Melanie, ready to dissect her and see exactly what she can learn from this unique child the hard way. Before Dr. Justineau can save her, all hell breaks loose and the facility is overrun. A small group of survivors is forced to travel to another sanctuary city in the hope that it\u2019s still being run by people who don\u2019t eat flesh. Melanie goes with them, and proves to be pretty useful.  One of the major strengths of \u201cThe Girl with All the Gifts\u201d is evident early in McCarthy\u2019s tactile, believable world-building. Much as Romero paid close attention to such details, the set design, costumes, and the world of \u201cGifts\u201d feels lived-in and genuine. And it\u2019s a nature-based aesthetic (dirt on walls, costumes that look worn, etc.) that continues and even strengthens once this ragtag crew is forced from safety and into the dangerous world. There\u2019s a visceral, emotional impact to the horror and action of \u201cThe Girl with All the Gifts\u201d that resonates because the characters and the world they live in feels real to us. It\u2019s hard to overstate how important this to a horror movie, especially one set in a post-apocalyptic world. If we don\u2019t believe the world is genuine, we won\u2019t care what happens in it. Advertisement Of course, performance goes a long way to amplify this believability as well, and it\u2019s not often you see a horror film with a cast this strong. Close could have gone showy with her doctor with a heart of ice but she plays it straight, again conveying the believability of the moment more than the B-movie archetype this character could have become. Considine and Arterton perfectly convey authority and warmth, respectively, although they\u2019re good enough to make these people into more than mere plot devices. And Nanua is a find, again never giving her performance with a knowing wink. So she\u2019s a zombie child who could be the evolutionary key to the future\u2014this just happens to be her reality. The traveling band aspect of \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d the cities and landscapes empty of human existence of \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d the military aspect of \u201cDay of the Dead\u201d\u2014it\u2019s easy to pick apart the influences of \u201cThe Girl with All the Gifts.\u201d But just as Melanie marks something altogether new in this world\u2014a zombie with a conscience\u2014the film about her feels inspired by what came before but also good enough to inspire those that come after.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Film Critic", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "If we agree with famous Baltimore contrarian H.L. Mencken that a\u00a0critic\u00a0must, above all things, have a \"capacity for gusto,\" then Victor Tallez (Rafael Spregelburd), the Buenos Aires\u00a0film\u00a0critic\u00a0moping his way through Hern\u00e1n Guerschuny's \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is failing spectacularly in his calling. The \"capacity for gusto\" has been sucked out of him. He sees too many\u00a0films, and all of them are bad. He has lost touch with the unwashed hoi polloi, who adore clich\u00e9d rom-coms, who approach things with (as he sees it) an uncritical eye. He rolls his eyes at gusto. Tallez is a clich\u00e9 himself, the\u00a0critic\u00a0who scoffs at popular taste, who feels the entire world has derailed into a pit of sentimentality and bad art. \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" pokes fun at\u00a0criticism\u00a0(at least Tallez's cranky prissy brand of it), and while lampooning self-serious intellectual\u00a0critics\u00a0is akin to shooting fish in a barrel, \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" takes a light and knowing tone, spoofing the sacred cows of the\u00a0critic\u00a0world, and cramming every scene with visual\u00a0film\u00a0clich\u00e9s that act like a \"Where's Waldo?\" of cinema.\u00a0 Advertisement The opening of \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" shows the back of Tallez's head as he walks through the Buenos Aires streets, all as he drones on in French about his \"maladie du cinema.\" \"Films\u00a0are suffocating me,\" he states flatly, and the condition is incurable. Set against grainy black-and-white street-scene images, reminiscent of the French New Wave, Tallez comes across as a dissociated gloomy figure, trapped in the confines of his own head. At the end of the opening, he drones, again in French, \"At one point one may want to know why I think in French.\" [Beat.] \"I have no idea.\" Of course, an Argentinian\u00a0film\u00a0critic, who sees the world as a French New Wave\u00a0film, who is working on an \"exhaustive\" study of Godard, would \"think\" in French.\u00a0 Tallez is a nationally syndicated\u00a0film\u00a0critic, and seems glumly proud of the fact that he hasn't given a review \"Four Seats\" (his newspaper gives \"seats\" instead of \"stars\") in years. He spends his days in a monotonous manner, going to press screenings, then out for coffee with a group of\u00a0critics. Back at the office, his boss rails at Tallez, scolding him for his harsh reviews (\"You are a terrorist of taste\"). Tallez's harshest critiques go to rom-coms, and he lectures his credulous niece (Telma Crisanti), who loves rom-coms and can recite \"Jerry Maguire\" from memory, on what is wrong with the genre. Tallez describes the rom-com clich\u00e9s: \"Do not forget to put rain, lots of rain. And a run. We don't know why, but they always run.\" (Cue image of Billy Crystal running to find Meg Ryan in \"Harry Met Sally.\") Tallez is a drip.\u00a0 Of course, over the course of \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic,\" Tallez meets an adorable and carefree woman named Sofia (Dolores Fonzi), who challenges all of his hard-won contempt for rom-coms. Sofia breezes into his life, wearing a big furry beret, carrying her Pink Panther bike helmet under her arm, a Manic Pixie Dream Girl par extraordinaire. She has no job, she is \"quirky\" (one of her quirks is kleptomania), she takes Tallez to experimental performance art pieces (Tallez drones in French on the voiceover: \"My God. Enough. Kill me.\") and, strangely enough, she has nothing better to do with her time than to hang out with this crank and show him how beautiful life can be. In its own fluffy way, Sofia is a critique of the movie clich\u00e9: woman as inspirational figure sprinkling fairy-dust over gloomy self-absorbed men drawn into their magical circle. When they first kiss, fireworks go off in the sky. Tallez has entered the rom-com of his nightmares and finds that it's not actually all that bad.\u00a0 Advertisement Guerschuny (who wrote and directed) takes a self-conscious and self-aware approach. \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is loaded with references to other\u00a0films, and the style changes drastically as the various subplots kick into gear. When Sofia enters, suddenly the\u00a0film\u00a0becomes a rom-com, with cute music and montage sequences, where she tries on adorable hats at a street market. In a darker subplot, Tallez is stalked by a young director, furious about Tallez's review of his\u00a0film. The director sneers at Tallez, \"It took me 5 years to make it. It took you 5 minutes to destroy it.\" The director shows up everywhere, in crowd scenes, across streets, glaring through the space at Tallez, and as that rises in importance, the\u00a0film veers into a thriller, complete with dark empty movie theatres, and ominous tracking shots.\u00a0 The most interesting thing about \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is how it poses the possibility that there may be more truth in clich\u00e9s than Tallez perhaps wants to acknowledge. The reason mass audiences respond to rom-coms (for example) is that such\u00a0films\u00a0approach the truth of the matter of Love, even in their non-realistic, sometimes tiresome ways. Love is something universal, and who you fall in love with is a matter of the greatest importance to regular people who are not characters in a movie. Rom-coms acknowledge that sense of importance, and the urgency of those clich\u00e9d moments (running through the rain, or running through an airport to stop your beloved from getting on a plane to Antarctica, or whatever, everyone is running), express that urgency in a formula that often works. If it didn't work, it wouldn't be used so much. As embarrassing as it is to Tallez, he discovers that falling in love with someone actually does feel like fireworks going off over the bay.\u00a0 Hern\u00e1n Guerschuny is a longtime\u00a0film\u00a0critic\u00a0(he runs the magazine Haciendo Cine) and \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is his debut. Many of the details in \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" are spot-on: the conversations at press screenings (arguing about whether a\u00a0film\u00a0is good/bad enough for The Berlinale), people making statements about how they hate comedy because \"there's nothing to discuss\", the constant references to cinema, the casual comments made during conversation, like: \"In high school I spent more time following the career of some director of photography than getting a girl's phone number.\" Much of \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is an in-joke aimed at an insular sub-culture, and so it lacks a sense of significant commentary on its subject matter (think of \"In a Lonely Place,\" or \"Adaptation,\" or \"Barton Fink\" for comparison). \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is an extended spoof more than anything else (it may have worked better as a short\u00a0film), and its targets are pretty shallow, but it still includes many entertaining and insightful elements.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}

But it's still a bit of a shame that this movie doesn't have more to offer than one more go-round for a great character, a bigoted twit who has delusions of musical grandeur but knows deep down how limited he is.\u00a0 David, of course, is the creation of writer/director/actor Ricky Gervais, who memorably portrayed him on the original series and a follow-up TV movie and has continued to bring him back around occasionally since then, to make guest appearances on the American TV spinoff of \"The Office,\" on concert stages, and in the popular YouTube series \"Play Guitar with David Brent.\" This film, which premiered last year, doesn't have much to add beyond a few biographical details.\u00a0 Advertisement   David has somehow landed a sales job at Lavichem, a chemical company. Introductory glimpses of David in the presence of coworkers confirm that he has softened a tiny bit, more due to suffering a string of defeats than by conscious choice, and fights a mostly losing battle to avoid offending everyone in sight by blurting out every thought he has at the instant that he has it. There's inappropriate sexual innuendo galore, and David and a coworker do a \"Chinaman\" impression at one point; Gervais cuts periodically to bystanders marveling that such a pathetic person could exist, much less have a decent job that places him alongside adults who can function in reality without continually offending each other. Another coworker explains that Brent is \"like a kid ... he wants attention ... you see a man that age and you thinking, 'What are you doing?'\"\u00a0   The original \"The Office\" made an art of eating its cake and having it, too, pointedly criticizing David's ignorance and thoughtlessness while deriving a comic thrill from seeing how dreadful his remarks could get and how he could push his luck without self-destructing. \"Life on the Road\" offers no such thrills because David is so far down that he has nowhere to go but up, and there are many moments where the film seems determined to make us flat-out love the guy even though there's nothing lovable about him except his suffering, all of which is self-inflicted.\u00a0   David embarks on a self-financed tour with a hired-out band of musicians, performing \"Ooh La La\" and other chestnuts for audiences of half-interested, often aghast patrons, falling down onstage, and somehow wrangling a radio interview that fails to mention his gig that night. The film is quite repetitive, essentially a very long sketch, and offers little in the way of character development for supporting players. In contrast to the original \"The Office,\" everyone else is there mainly to stare in shock at David as he offends people or does something stupid. There's also the disquieting sense that the entire project exists so that people can get a nice, long opportunity to hear Gervais sing and think, \"Wow\u2014you know, this is a joke, but he's actually not bad.\"\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}

Well, sorta. Working from a book by Laura\r\nKasischke that one presumes lacks the melodrama other writers would have\r\nlayered into a story about the destruction of a teenage girl\u2019s family, Araki\r\ntreats his subject matter with a heady dose of apathy. Kat\u2019s mother, the\r\nflamboyant Eve (Eva Green), just up and disappears one day. Kat suspects that\r\nher boyfriend Phil (Shiloh Fernandez) may know more about the disappearance\r\nthan he lets on, and the cops, led by Detective Scieziesciez (Thomas Jane),\r\nsuspect dear old dad (Christopher Meloni), of course. But the \u201cmystery\u201d of Eve\u2019s\r\ndisappearance is never front and center in \u201cWhite Bird in a Blizzard.\u201d To be\r\nhonest, little is front and center. Kat meanders through the hazy days after\r\nher mom\u2019s disappearance, we get a few flashbacks and then the film jumps\r\nforward for a final chapter. And that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not suggesting that all films need a grand purpose, but \u201cWhite\r\nBird in a Blizzard\u201d doesn\u2019t work as mystery or character study. It\u2019s a melting\r\npot of themes that have not only been handled more interestingly in recent\r\nyears but have been handled more interestingly within its own director\u2019s\r\nfilmography\u2014murder, apathy, obsession, sex and intrigue in suburbia. Parts of\r\nit play broad like satire, as if Araki is doing a riff on \u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d\r\nbut too much of it sits there, almost as if Araki isn't excited by the material he's been given. Not all of it just \"sits there,\" however. As they often are, Araki\u2019s music\r\nchoices are clever, and I\u2019m happy to have lived long enough to have seen an\r\nextended dance scene to Depeche Mode\u2019s \u201cBehind the Wheel.\u201d And Woodley, as she\r\nso often does, grounds the film in something genuine. She has such a natural,\r\nin-the-moment presence that she keeps us interested in Kat\u2019s arc even when the storytelling\r\ndoesn\u2019t. And then there\u2019s Eva. Eva Green turns Eve into a character Joan\r\nCrawford would have told to tone it down. She is larger than life, desperate to\r\nbe the most important person in the room. And \u201cWhite Bird\u201d is at its most\r\ninteresting when Green is allowed to play the dark soul of a woman shattered by\r\nthe realization that her daughter was suddenly more interesting than she was.\r\nGreen is fantastic here, truly memorable in just a few scenes.

The star of some of the greatest films ever made\u2014never mind nation or genre, just GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE\u2014the man was an exacting, electrifying performer. In documenting and celebrating his life and his films, you\u2019d have to go very far wrong indeed to come out of the effort with something bad or uninteresting. Advertisement   That said, \u201cMifune: The Last Samurai,\u201d a documentary on the actor directed by Steven Okazaki and narrated by Keanu Reeves (the script is by Okazaki and Stuart Galbraith IV) got off on a somewhat bad foot for me. Explaining Mifune\u2019s place in the firmament of pop culture, the narration says of his collaborations with director Akira Kurosawa, \u201cwithout them there would have been no \u2018Magnificent Seven.\u2019\u201d This is factually true but seems to me to throw out a very crucial baby with the bathwater. What makes Kurosawa and Mifune crucial is that without them there would be no \u201cSeven Samurai.\u201d   But the fact of the matter is that I\u2019m not the \u201ckey demo\u201d for this movie. \u201cMifune: The Last Samurai\u201d wasn\u2019t made for fans like me. Although fans like me will likely be the first in line to see it. After explaining Mifune\u2019s importance, the movie lays out a brief history of Japanese cinema, the \u201cchanbara\u201d (swordplay) movie in particular. Only then does it get to Mifune\u2019s fascinating life: Born in 1920 to parents who set up business in China, he only sets foot in Japan at age 20, to fight in World War II. That experience was traumatic, but not in a conventional way. Harboring no ambitions to act, he tries to follow a bit in his photographer father\u2019s footsteps by apprenticing as a camera assistant at a film studio. His good looks, simultaneously rugged and smooth get him noticed, and so\u2026   What the movie is very good at revealing and expanding upon is how this reluctant actor became such a masterful one. In part it was due to his presence. \u201cHe\u2019s not an actor who blends into the background,\u201d one of his surviving colleagues notes. In part it was due to what his life experience taught him. His experience made him determined, one interviewee notes, to \u201cnever again be the kind of person who bends to authority.\u201d But it was also, eventually, his devotion and his research. His frequent costar and friend Yoshio Tsuchiya notes \u201cThe one word I would use to describe Mifune is \u2018perseverance\u2019!\u201d Advertisement   Mifune put himself through a lot. He was a heavy drinker whose alcohol abuse ended up affecting his family life. His oldest son nevertheless remembers his father\u2019s great \u201ccompassion.\u201d The movie concentrates mostly on Mifune\u2019s collaboration with Kurosawa, which yielded great pictures such as the groundbreaking \u201cRashomon,\u201d \u201cSamurai,\u201d \u201cThe Hidden Fortress,\u201d \u201cYojimbo,\u201d and \u201cRed Beard.\u201d While it does not dig deep on what ended their collaboration (Martin Scorsese, also known as a director with a compelling long-term relationship with a single actor, now dormant, offers some fascinating rumination on the subject), its account of a sort of long-distance reconciliation is very moving.   The movie\u2019s clips are thrilling, and apt. While I commend \u201cMifune: The Last Samurai\u201d for its briskness, and its occasional crowd-pleasing playfulness\u2014as when it introduces viewers to the actor who put on the rubber suit to play Godzilla the same year he was a samurai in Kurosawa\u2019s classic\u2014it\u2019s a movie I myself could have stood to see more of. Fascinating Mifune/Kurosawa collaborations such as \u201cStray Dog\u201d and \u201cThe Idiot\u201d are given short shrift if mentioned at all. When going into Mifune\u2019s international career, his role in \u201cHell In The Pacific,\u201d in which he goes one-on-one with another icon/legend, Lee Marvin, is given the briefest of mentions. Last I looked, that movie\u2019s director John Boorman is both alive and as voluble as ever. And so on. Again, these quibbles arise from the fact that this is a beginner\u2019s guide, not a fest for fans. Is it too much to expect an expanded DVD edition though?", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Michael Jackson's Journey from Motown to Off the Wall", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Michael may be the purest talent I've ever seen. He's incapable of a false moment.\" \u00a0- Director Sidney Lumet, on Michael Jackson in \"The Wiz.\" Michael Jackson, along with his almost otherworldly talent, was always one of the most emotional performers. In the pantheon with James Brown, Judy Garland, Jackie Wilson, and a handful of other electric live performers, Jackson's onstage persona and performing ability was akin to the Big Bang, there was no end to the expansion. People responded to him personally, and, because he started out so young, a generation grew up with him, identified with him, watched in awe at his transformations. Spike Lee's documentary \"Michael Jackson\u2019s Journey From Motown to Off the Wall,\" premiering on\u00a0February 5th\u00a0on Showtime, is as emotional as its subject matter. Kobe Bryant, interviewed in the documentary, says at one point, \"It's easy for people to get sidetracked. They talk about his complexion. They don't focus on what this man was, and how he was that.\" What with the tabloid frenzy of Michael Jackson's life, not to mention his early death, Lee's documentary is a welcome corrective as well as an almost aggressive act of redress and celebration. It does not get \"sidetracked.\" It's about Michael Jackson's work, and how he worked. Maybe most pleasingly, it's a track-by-track history lesson of Jackson's 1979 album \"Off the Wall,\" an album that still gets so much radio play today that if you didn't know better you might think it was released last weekend.  Advertisement The plot points of Jackson's early life (the rise of the Jackson 5 on Motown, their jump to Epic, Michael emerging as the solo star, culminating in Off the Wall) may be well-known to those who grew up in that era but Lee presents it in a way that passes the information on to a new generation. When there is an artist as big as Michael Jackson was, as important, as ... improbable, really (and it's more improbable the more you learn), it's essential that an understanding of the achievement of that art is passed on (especially to kids who may only know him as the weird man in sunglasses on the cover of every tabloid). A film like Lee's says: \"See what he did? See how much space he created for others? For you? Honor that.\"  Format-wise, the documentary is pretty standard: fun archival footage of concerts and cartoons and interviews, beautiful still photographs, and lots of interview subjects. Quincy Jones, Motown's Berry Gordy, Philadelphia soul producers Gamble and Huff, Ron Alexenburg at Epic, Marlon and Jackie Jackson, all provide background for the Motown years, the Epic years, for the explosion of the Jackson 5 as a worldwide phenomenon.  Counterpointed against the professional memories of Jackson's colleagues, are the voices of those inspired by Michael Jackson, including Lee himself. Lee Daniels (\"He's everything I aspired to be\"), David Byrne, Mark Ronson, Rosie Perez, John Leguizamo, Questlove, Misty Copeland, Kobe Bryant, Pharrell, John Legend ... all weigh in with memories of what he meant to them, how he pushed them to be better in their own work, try harder, work harder.  What happens as you listen to the chorus of voices is that a different kind of story starts to emerge. Talent is one thing. Michael Jackson obviously had that. But he was not just a raw genius who knew how to sing and move. Even as a child, he approached his work (and the Motown giants around him) with curiosity, inquisitiveness, and an insatiable desire to learn from them. He himself said that the key to success was \"listening.\" The documentary pays tribute to his dancing as well as his singing. Jackson was a prodigy dancer, obsessed with The Nicholas Brothers, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Sammy Davis, Jr., able to replicate their routines perfectly after watching them only once. What became his recognizable dance style had long roots in the culture, and his moves incorporated the whole history of American dance.  Advertisement One of the most gratifying sections of the documentary is the\u00a0in-depth \"Off the Wall\" discussion, song by song by song: the \"hooks,\" the rhythm sections, the horns, the guitars. Musicians reminisce about playing on that album, and contemporary musicians talk about the impact that this or that specific sound had on their own work. It's so rich and so informative that the moment I finished watching the documentary I listened to the album front to back. I grew up with Michael Jackson. I have all the albums. It may sound trite, but watching all of the footage in the documentary, the concerts, music videos, television appearances, his beautifully simple performance of \"Ben\" at the 45th Academy Awards, at age 14, drives home just how much we lost when we lost him.  The other element of Michael Jackson's career that becomes crystal clear in the documentary is the fact that nobody\u2014not even music industry people who thought Michael Jackson was talented\u2014could perceive just how big he was going to get. How many cute child-stars go on to become as huge an adult star as Michael Jackson? Who could even envision something like that? The perception of the Jackson 5 was that they were very successful, but they were a \"packaged\" commodity, a novelty act. A lot of the people at Epic didn't want them on the label. Campaigns on their behalf had to be fought all along the way, as insane as that sounds now.  Michael Jackson's career is a powerful example of what it looks like when an artist loves what he does. It's a high bar, but that's as it should be. If you don't approach your work like that as an artist, why do it? It's a concept brought up again and again in the documentary, perhaps its most emotional component. How many music stars today barely seem to like what they're doing, let alone love\u00a0it? The documentary is a reminder, and an important one, about what Michael Jackson brought to the table, and it was more than talent, it was love. That is what audiences felt when they watched Michael Jackson, and when they listened to his songs. It's why Rosie Perez almost tears up in her interview, talking about her sense of \"thankfulness\" to him because of how much joy he brought to her life. Exquisitely researched, beautifully put together, with that celebratory knowledgeable chorus of voices pouring over us, what Spike Lee's documentary really is is an act of love.

{"Title": "Can We Take a Joke?", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"It doesn't take much to rile up the outrage police these days,\" says the opening line of narration in \"Can We Take a Joke?\", Ted Balaker's documentary about the plight of comedians in the age of social media shaming, campus speech codes and mandatory apologies. \"If you're a comedian, there might be calls for your show to be cancelled \r\nif someone takes offense at your joke ... but some people are brave enough \r\nor stupid enough to fight back.\" Right away you know what this movie is: a brief for the defense. And it remains so throughout the movie's brisk 74-minute running time, as the filmmaker interviews several veteran stand-up comics, including Gilbert Gottfried, Lisa Lampanelli, Jim Norton, Heather MacDonald, Karith Foster and Adam Carolla, about how the 21st century has affected an art form that Lenny Bruce dragged kicking and screaming into the 20th. Advertisement The film will play well among standup comics who feel they've been muzzled by humorless slogan-spouting liberals, bluenoses and the generally squeamish, as well as by viewers who've bought into the idea that American college campuses have becoming havens for baby Stalinists who either won't permit contrarian thoughts to be expressed or shout them down through heckling, protests, and petitions. \"You don't walk through a museum with a towel and throw it over paintings that you don't like,\" Norton says in a standup clip about the issue. Unfortunately, the result too often plays as if you've been invited to \r\nread half of a courtroom transcript\u2014the defense's half\u2014while skipping \r\npast redacted text that might have complicated or undermined the \r\nargument. What's being advocated here is, \"Shut up and like it,\" which seems neither sporting nor especially revealing of the free speech values the movie says it's so enamored with.  There are many examples of audience members, including college students, heckling standup comics who have offended them\u2014including Reed College student Sal Rodriguez, who was heckled by a female student during a standup set making fun of women for enrolling in humanities courses while complaining that women are underrepresented in math and science, then lashed back by calling the woman a \"cunt.\" She stormed the stage, took the microphone away and demanded that he shut up and sit down.  This event, captured on video and partly replayed in the movie, is indeed outrageous\u2014no comedian performing in front of a paid audience should have their act terminated by a single audience member, no matter what the cause. And the idea of establishing a support group for anyone traumatized by his set does sound silly on its face. But as you watch the clip, you might also be struck by how poorly Rodriguez handled what most professional comics would consider a pretty unremarkable initial push-back by an audience member. If you can't shut down a heckler by being clever, conciliatory, surreal, or otherwise imaginative, you shouldn't be in standup comedy. Balaker also leaves out the follow-up to the incident\u2014Rodriguez's email calling anyone who complained about his act \"faggoty pussies.\"  Advertisement Despite the presence of Lampanelli, a white female comic in the Don Rickles-Joan Rivers mode whose outrageously cutting persona is carefully modulated, and Foster, an African-American woman who used to contribute to \"Imus in the Morning\" (a radio show not known for its sympathies to the sorts of activists criticized in this film), most of the major interviewees here are white guys in their forties or fifties who seem peeved that they can't just say anything they want and be acclaimed as brilliant satirists or harmless purveyors of fun. Their situation often seems less a portrait of righteous village truth-tellers being chased by pitchfork-wielding mobs (as suggested in a bit of old-movie footage) than of a sub-group of comedians who haven't quite adapted to a new world where audience members are unwilling to suffer grievances in silence, and can now double as critics, thanks to online platforms. Their beleaguered attitude may be justified, but despite a few cherry-picked examples of extreme or ridiculous responses\u2014and justifiable astonishment that anyone would come to see an in-you-face standup comic and not expect to be offended here or there\u2014there's not much evidence in the movie to suggest that's an open-and-shut case. And we never get close scrutiny of material that arouses such ire, much less rebuttals by writers such as Roxane Gay and Lindy West, who have written extensively on this subject (and gotten into online feuds with prominent comics like Patton Oswalt) over whether heckling, walkouts, angry editorials and the like are quasi-fascist overreactions or merely an example of answering free speech with more free speech.   There are too many unexamined premises in this film, starting with the idea that heckling, student petitions, calls for apologies and the like are \"censorship\"\u2014a word that people living in China or who survived life in the former Soviet Union understand, and would use correctly; in the US, private businesses and institutions, from Harvard to Twitter, can deny a platform, but only the government can completely muzzle an individual\u2014or if they're an unruly response to an unruly art form that amounts to a conversation between the comic and his or her audience. Standup is a mostly-one way conversation, granted. But it's one that should allow for the possibility that audiences might not like the material or find it amusing, or that the comedian may in fact be on the wrong side of an issue, or punching down (heaping abuse on groups that are essentially powerless) versus punching up (against authority figures and representatives of a repressing ruling class, Saint Lenny's targets).  Advertisement The Marx Brothers, who are background figures in this movie, also represented a spirit of anarchy and liberation; they were all about expressing impulses that we're taught to keep under wraps, and they aimed their madness at institutions, the rich, the supposedly cultured, and regular people who had comparatively little power but used it to crush the joy out of life. \"Mel Brooks, whose \"Blazing Saddles\" is often held up as an example of the kind of politically incorrect film They Don't Make Anymore, was just as sophisticated, in his lowbrow way: \"Saddles\" is filled with crude sex jokes and racial slurs, including the N-word, but it's ultimately a satire on racism and sexism, and it's always on the side of the little guy, and ultimately appeals to kindness and decency no matter how outrageous it gets. George Carlin, who died in 2009 but is a heavy presence in here via interview clips, is likewise held up as an example of why shocking, contrarian or unpleasant material should be protected. But the movie ignores the content of Carlin's material just as it dances around the gist of Bruce's: Carlin attacked government, institutionalized sexism and racism, TV networks' squeamishness about sex and profanity, the military industrial complex, corporations' contempt for consumers and the environment, and other amorphous but real and oppressive presences. And when he did a routine about how rape jokes could be funny, it still didn't treat it lightly, as several comics casually defending the right to make rape jokes do here. Although he wasn't always exact, much less always hilarious, Carlin never lost sight of who had power and who didn't, an important distinction in standup, as well as other popular art forms, that \"Can We Take a Joke?\" mostly avoids.  \"When people are outraged by something, they're also patting themselves \r\non the back, like, 'I'm a good person, and I was offended.'\" says Gottfried. Mind-reading of this kind is the last resort of the comic who is incapable of looking inward. People may, in fact, be genuinely offended, and they may have good reason to be offended\u2014and whether they're being sincere or not in their expression of that outrage, the best way to shut them down is to be so hilarious, so truthful, so connected to the entire human race, that the heckler can't do anything but laugh or leave.

{"Title": "Two Men in Town", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "This movie is a loose remake of a 1973 French crime drama written and directed by Jose\u00a0Giovanni, who wrote a handful of classic genre pictures, including Jacques Becker\u2019s\u00a0prison-break picture \u201cLe Trou,\u201d Alain Corneau\u2019s gangster-on-the-run story \u201cClasse tous\u00a0risques\u201d (both 1960) and Jean-Pierre Melville\u2019s one-last-caper \u201cLe Deuxieme Souffle\u201d\u00a0(1966). Giovanni\u2019s original was a tense, lean narrative of a paroled con dogged by an\u00a0old enemy, a cop with a grudge. This film, directed by Rachid Bouchareb, best known\u00a0in this country for his \u201cIndig\u00e8nes\u201d (aka \u201cDays of Glory\u201d), about North African soldiers\u00a0fighting for France in World War II, makes the story a bit baggier, and, in a reach for\u00a0contemporary significance, changes its setting to contemporary New Mexico and makes\u00a0its paroled criminal a convert to Islam.\u00a0 Advertisement In this update, the viewer knows things are going to end badly from the opening shots.\u00a0One of the film\u2019s characters is seen dragging an inert body over a desert landscape.\u00a0Then, in a long shot, he\u2019s seen smashing the body\u2019s head with a rock while screaming.\u00a0The perspective reminded me of a similar death-seen-from-a-great distance scene, in Abderrahmane Sissako\u2019s extraordinary 2014 \u201cTimbuktu,\u201d but where Sissako\u2019s scene\u00a0showed a quiet, implacable assurance, Bouchareb\u2019s presentation has a slight ring of\u00a0manipulative dynamics, and overdetermination. This feel persists over the course of\u00a0many perfectly-framed vistas, including a shot of Brenda Blethyn standing in a doorway\u00a0that is practically begging the viewer to compare it to \u201cThe Searchers.\u201d But Blethyn\u2019s\u00a0recognizable presence also constitutes a godsend of sorts: when this film's excellent actors\u00a0are given things to do, Bouchareb\u2019s heavy-handedness is easier to ignore.\u00a0 Blethyn\u2019s character is a parole officer. Forrest Whitaker plays Garnett, out three years\u00a0early from a twenty-year-plus sentence; seems he killed a deputy during his gang-banger\u00a0times. Harvey Keitel is Agati, a humane but exceptionally businesslike sheriff who has an\u00a0extreme grudge against Garnett. The movie takes its time with these characters. Garnett,\u00a0praised early on by his spiritual adviser on having learned to control his anger (there\u2019s\u00a0the first-act gun-mention you always hear that Chekhov quotation pulled out about), rides\u00a0around on a motorbike enjoying his newfound freedom while Agati seethes and ponders\u00a0what he\u2019s going to do about this new problem preying on his mind. Blethyn\u2019s character\u00a0gives Garnett the old tough-not-quite-love treatment, bristling when he ingenuously\u00a0boasts to her about a date with a woman he\u2019s about to go on. \u201cTell her the truth,\u201d she\u00a0bluntly advises him. And he does, eventually. But once Agati starts harassing him, and\u00a0once an old criminal associate (Luis Guzman) starts trying to lure him back into the fold,\u00a0Garnett starts coiling up into himself more and more. An explosion is bound to happen.\u00a0 The suspense is spiced up here by the culture clashes implicit in the environment and\u00a0explicit in some of the characterizations. Early in the film Keitel\u2019s sheriff asks Blethyn\u2019s\u00a0character to stop by a barbecue celebrating the return home of some troops who\u2019ve been\u00a0serving in Afghanistan. Garnett\u2019s devotion to his newfound faith doesn\u2019t impress Agati\u00a0at all: in fact it seems to deepen his resentment of the character. What\u2019s odd about \u201cTwo\u00a0Men\u201d is the fact that after establishing all of this material relative to character, Bouchareb,\u00a0who co-wrote the adaptation with Olivier Lorelle and Yasmina Khadra, allows it to\u00a0all fall away. The story builds to a climactic confrontation, but not the one, perhaps,\u00a0that we\u2019ve been expecting, and then ends on a frustratingly indeterminate note that has\u00a0little to do with the issues the movie went to the trouble to raise in the first place. As\u00a0exceptional as the acting in the picture is, and it is wonderful\u2014Whitaker and Keitel are as\u00a0inventive and surprising as they\u2019ve been in years, and the supporting roles played by the\u00a0likes of Ellen Burstyn and Stan Carp are well-sketched\u2014it can\u2019t entirely lift the movie\u00a0from the rut it has all but plowed into by the end credits.

A measure of how the world has changed is given the viewer\r\nin this movie\u2019s opening presentation logos: a welder works on a bike in a\r\nsparkling garage, while a little girl cavorts about; the logo \u201cRed Bull Media\r\nHouse\u201d manifests itself in 3D, followed by the logo of Freeride Entertainment;\r\nwe\u2019re then informed, in this garage, that what follows is \u201cSupported By\r\nSkullcandy.\u201d (Later in the movie, a motorcyclist executes a stunt from a Park\r\nCity, Utah, ski jump, and vaults over another Skullcandy logo.) The machines of\r\nescape are now lifestyle appurtenances.  What follows is all handsomely shot and not without some\r\ngeneral interest\u2014but the movie\u2019s only really going to play for you if motorcycles\r\nand those who ride them are subjects to which you\u2019re somewhat sympathetic. Dana\r\nBrown himself supplies the narration, and it\u2019s a welter of sub-MTV style\r\nadvertisements for itself; this is a story, Brown announces, \u201cthat defies\r\nstereotypes,\u201d which usually means that it rearranges a particular set of\r\nstereotypes to make it seem as if it\u2019s defying stereotypes. I mean, don\u2019t get\r\nme wrong, the stuff about the deaf female motorcyclist Ashley Fiolek is\r\ninteresting and somewhat touching, but to this viewer it would have been even\r\nmore so had I not been assured about how surprised I was going to be right at\r\nthe outset.

{"Title": "Stray Dogs", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Stray Dogs,\"\u00a0Tsai Ming-Liang's first feature in five years, is a mysterious and deliberately prolonged series of tableaus about the fragility of flesh and the smallness of humanity, among other things.\u00a0 Like most of his films\u2014but particularly ones built around very long takes, such as 2003's masterful \"Goodbye, Dragon Inn\"; his 35-minute short \"Madame Butterfly,\" which has just three shots; and this one\u2014it refuses to engage with anything resembling conventional, commercially viable storytelling. This is a director whose 1997 film \"The River\" kicked off with a locked-down shot of an escalator on which the main action was a wordless exchange of glances between a man and a woman who didn't enter the frame for half a minute.\u00a0Compared to Tsai, the hypnotically austere\u00a0Apichatpong Weerasethakul (\"Syndromes and a Century,\" \"Tropical Malady\") seems fidgety.\u00a0 Advertisement Before he decided to focus on cinema, Tsai worked in experimental theater, and if you've decided to sample his work for the first time starting with this new feature, you should bear that in mind as you watch. There is no plot to speak of here, nor are there any characters\u2014not in any conventional sense of the terms. We're not watching people pursue specific goals, solve specific problems, and learn and grow on the way to catharsis. We're just watching people exist and intuiting the story that drives them from situation to situation, and then moving on to connect the people and the landscape with basic, deep concerns: the isolation and disconnection of life in anonymous big cities; the sense of being suspended in a perpetual present even as time rolls on; the tactility of forests and roads, rooms and furniture, clothes and books, bedsheets\u00a0and\u00a0skin. Cinema often lures us into thinking about what people and places and situations represent rather than appreciating their essence. Tsai's films push against that tendency.\u00a0They might owe more to documentaries, or to theatrical installations, than to most traditional scripted features. The last ten minutes of this movie consist of an unbroken long take of characters staring at a mural. The movie begins with a long shot of a mother sitting on the edge of a bed, brushing her hair as she watches her two children (Lee Yi Cheng\u00a0and his sister\u00a0Li Yi Chieh) sleep. This woman, presumably the children's mother, vanishes from the story, and the siblings are next seen living with their dad (Lee Kang-Sheng) inside a shipping container and making pocket money holding up advertising signage at a busy urban intersection.\u00a0The film continues like that, observing the harshness of the children's lives, and their father's exhaustion and seemingly constant depression (he seems to spend a lot of the money they make as a family on alcohol and smokes).\u00a0\u201cHeaven and Earth are heartless, treating creatures like straw dogs,\" says the\u00a0Tao Te Ching.\u00a0 In one of the movie's longest, most wrenching scenes\u2014one that oddly mirrors the opening shot\u2014the father joins his two kids in bed, then rolls over, and as the camera follows his movement, it reveals a sort of mother-substitute figure: a head of cabbage with a mouth and eyes drawn on it, nestled awkwardly into a sweater. The man becomes unnerved by it, then vigorously mimes smothering it, then finally devours it, weeping cathartically.\u00a0 This is one of the strangest and most upsetting sequences I've seen in a film in a long time, precisely because the father never verbalizes the fluctuations in his emotions. There's no monologue, no voice-over. We're just watching a man lose it, step by step, until he finally seems to implode in despair, then slowly ramp down and locate his center again. Something about it reminded me of the scenes in \"Twin Peaks\" where Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) weeps as he dances with an imagined version of his murdered daughter to the tune of \"Pennsylvania 6-5000.\" I've watched that scene many times in the presence of other people; they always laugh at first, albeit nervously, but they always stop laughing as it goes on and on, and it becomes clear that we're in the presence of a man whose tether to reality has snapped. Advertisement Scene after scene in \"Stray Dogs\" drives home the difficulty of daily existence while also (perhaps paradoxically\u2014or not, if you're Buddhist, as Tsai is) making you appreciate the incidental, beautiful sights and sounds that our busyness or our pain might otherwise cause us to ignore: the way tall swamp grass rustles as the father pushes a small wooden rowboat through it; the hiss of rain on wet ground and foliage in the storm sequence; the play of sunlight on the tile and white glass of a luxury apartment that the father has wandered into (briefly experiencing, and imagining, a life of comfort). This is, as you've surely gathered, the sort of film that does not have what studio executives would call \"a pre-sold audience.\" It asks a lot of us. In fact it asks us to set aside everything we've been conditioned to think movies are, and roll with a different way of seeing and hearing things, and connect.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "A Futile & Stupid Gesture", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The good men and women of the National Lampoon changed comedy forever. The impact of their magazine and movies like \u201cAnimal House\u201d and \u201cCaddyshack\u201d can undeniably be felt in almost all modern comedy, but certainly in the quirky style of writer/actor/director David Wain. One of the members of \u201cThe State\u201d and the team behind \u201cWet Hot American Summer,\u201d Wain has always operated under the \u201ccomedy ensemble\u201d concept of filmmaking and TV, bringing together the same performers over and over again, often skewering expectations of the genre, as in his spoof of rom-coms, the underrated \u201cThey Came Together.\u201d Could he be too good a fit for the story of National Lampoon? Does this explain why \u201cA Futile & Stupid Gesture,\u201d while being full of likable and funny people isn\u2019t all that funny or likable? Because it's too much like telling your own story?\u00a0While there\u2019s a bit of hero worship going on that deflates the piece, and Wain\u2019s direction is surprisingly uninspired, the biggest problem is the script that tries to cover too much ground but doesn\u2019t really have that much to say as it does so. Advertisement There\u2019s a scene in this film about the rise of National Lampoon that sums it up in ways that writers John Aboud and Michael Colton certainly didn\u2019t intend. The writers are sitting around throwing out ideas when Tony Hendra (Matt Lucas) drops a dull idea\u2014drawing Nixon with Pinocchio\u2019s nose. For some reason, this bad joke that nearly got Hendra run out of the room kept coming back to me. Just as it\u2019s an obvious way to convey a message\u2014Nixon is a liar\u2014too much of \u201cA Futile & Stupid Gesture\u201d takes a similarly predictable route to gets its history across. The story of Doug Kenney and the ascendance of National Lampoon is told primarily through narration and montage. It\u2019s a Greatest Hits collection, hitting the beats that anyone who saw \u201cDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead\u201d already knows, and doing so incredibly superficially. The best thing about Wain\u2019s film is the casting, including one brilliant piece of meta analysis, but that only gets a movie so far.    Will Forte plays Kenney, who took the Harvard Lampoon that they helped through one of its most successful phases and turned it into an international phenomenon with his best buddy, Henry Beard (Domhnall Gleeson, giving the most grounded and interesting performance in the film despite an awful wig.) When they get to New York and found the magazine, the film rushes through a decade or so of history from the first days of groundbreaking comedy through the movies and up to Kenney\u2019s death in 1980. We meet tons of the major comedians from the era including Gilda Radner (Jackie Tohn), Bill Murray (Jon Daly), John Landis (Brian Huskey), John Belushi (John Gemberling), Christopher Guest (Seth Green), and the one and only Chevy Chase, played by his \u201cCommunity\u201d co-star Joel McHale, with whom he had a notoriously contentious on-set relationship. Imagine playing one of your least favorite co-workers in a film. McHale doesn\u2019t go for parody, nailing Chase\u2019s rhythms and comedic timing, although it\u2019s telling that Chase is portrayed here is something of an enabler for his best buddy when it comes to drugs.    Martin Mull plays an older version of Doug Kenney, which is itself a slightly crazy framing choice given that Kenney died when he was 36. So is Mull playing Kenney from the afterlife? The truth is that it\u2019s a lazy narrative choice, allowing Kenney to comment on his own story from afar, although it would have been just as effective to have Forte do these fourth-wall breaks. It\u2019s almost like someone just wanted to get Mull in the movie and the other parts were taken. The emphasis on Kenney is particularly frustrating narratively in that this is way more his story than that of Lampoon. Of course, Kenney is a breakthrough voice in comedy, but there\u2019s a more balanced version of this story that\u2019s way more interesting.    Advertisement Worst of all, \u201cA Futile and Stupid Gesture\u201d can\u2019t keep its irreverent, NL-inspired tone throughout, and Wain can\u2019t quite handle the serious stuff\u2014one gets the impression he\u2019d much rather be hanging out in the writer\u2019s room or behind-the-scenes of the radio show than dealing with Kenney\u2019s drug addiction and infidelities. The superficial reimagining of comedy highlights is kinda fun in a \u201cThe Chris Farley Show\u201d kind of way (\u201cRemember that food fight? That was awesome.\u201d) but that tone definitely doesn\u2019t work when the film has to be even remotely serious. At one point, Kenney says \u201cComedy doesn\u2019t have to be pretty. It should be fucking raw.\u201d In the way it handles both comedy and misery, I wish this movie was too.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Cars 3", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cCars\u201d and \u201cCars 2,\u201d are outliers in Pixar\u2019s lineup of critically acclaimed, family friendly blockbusters: the original made a fortune despite poor reviews, and the sequel made another fortune despite even worse reviews. A sort-of spin-off, \u201cPlanes\u201d\u2014which is not part of the extended Carsoverse, but was released by Pixar's parent company, Disney\u2014got pounded like a pi\u00f1ata by reviewers, but it made so much loot that Pixar churned out a sequel, \u201cPlanes: Fire & Rescue,\u201d one year later. And at no point in this timeline of movies about anthropomorphic vehicles did Pixar, a company that\u2019s gone to great lengths to convince us that it never does things just for the money, seem to lose sleep over the prospect that we\u2019d think they that's exactly why they were making more \"Cars\" and \"Planes\" films. Advertisement Lo and behold: here\u2019s \u201cCars 3,\u201d a smiley-faced Frankenstein\u2019s monster comprised of bits and pieces lifted from every other sports film in existence. The screenplay rips off the main plot of the Tom Cruise racing picture \u201cDays of Thunder\u201d (knowingly, though; a supporting race car character is cleverly named \u201cCruz\u201d) and merges it with bits of \u201cRocky III,\u201d the one where the champ went soft and had to find his edge again; \u201cRocky IV,\u201d where the champ had to train in snowy Siberian woods to fend off a challenger who relied on steroids and fancy machines, and \u201cCreed,\u201d where the champ realized that passing wisdom on to the next generation can be as satisfying as acquiring it when you\u2019re young. There is, at the level of plot and characterization, not a single major element in this movie that you haven\u2019t seen elsewhere, possibly in a \u201cCars\u201d or \u201cPlanes\u201d film. Despite its lack of originality, as well as its lackadaisical storytelling and world building, it satisfies in that amiably weird way that only a \"Cars\" film can.  Champion race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has been on top for so long that he has failed to notice that he\u2019s not getting any younger. He\u2019s challenged by a snotty, bullying wannabe-champ, Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer), a super-high tech car that can go 200 m.p.h. without breaking a\u2014well, cars don\u2019t sweat, but you get the idea. Following a disastrous defeat by Storm, Lightning lets his sponsor Sterling (Nathan Fillion) talk him into training in an elaborate racing simulation facility under a younger trainer, Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), who excitedly but thoughtlessly describes him as \u201cmy senior project.\u201d When Lighting wipes out there, too, Sterling informs him that he\u2019s mainly interested in using a retired Lightning as a pitchman for Rust-eze mud flaps. This leads the former champ to return to his roots in the rural holler where his late mentor Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, playing \u201chimself\u201d via outtakes and a celebrity impersonator) learned skills and tricks that he passed down to Lightning. And it\u2019s here that \"Rocky IV\" rears its meaty head, with a montage that contrasts Lightning and Cruz driving through woods and around dirt tracks against shots of Storm training in an indoor facility that looks like a place where a Bond villain might throw a Christmas party. It\u2019s not a spoiler to say that this film has a happy ending, but to its credit, for all its clich\u00e9s, it doesn\u2019t give us the ending we expect. The Doc-Lightning and Lightning-Cruz relationships suggest a passing of the torch, and \u201cCars 3\u201d finds a decent way to give us that, along with a sub-theme of female empowerment and a sincere belief in the idea that privileges have to be given up or amended if society, even a car-centric one, is going to keep evolving. The film hedges its bets here, though, as if it\u2019s trying to avoid a boycott led by the sorts of men who buy tickets to women-only screenings of \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and think they\u2019re striking a blow for civil rights. And the notion of a gendered car universe that grapples with sexism is discombobulating because the film mostly dances around the issue without mustering the nerve or the chops to properly deal with it.\u00a0(When Lightning repeatedly diminishes Cruz as \u201ca trainer\u201d rather than \u201ca racer,\u201d it sounds like he\u2019s trying to put a female car in her place, and when Storm taunts Cruz, his insults evoke a male nerd taunting a female one for not being a \"true\" fan of the thing they both love.)  Advertisement The notion of automotive gender and discrimination issues is not something the series ever tackled before; likewise the implication of a car caste system, where you're born into a particular automotive body and that defines the rest of your life, however long that is. Of course, this is a series in which cars can have baby cars, and there are car insects (or insect cars?), and in the second movie there are living planes, presumably to transport the cars long distances, inside of their bodies. And the tractors in these movies are coded as \"cattle,\" which I guess are eaten by the other cars.\u00a0  This sort of awkwardness is common in the worlds of \u201cCars\u201d and \u201cPlanes.\" The films draw jokey inspiration from the human world in ways that amuse in the moment but seem weirdly chilling when you think about them later. As many \u201cCars\u201d and \u201cPlanes\u201d obsessives have pointed out, dialogue and subplots in both and \u201cCars\u201d and \u201cCars 2\u201d suggest that this world once included humans, which raises the prospect of a \u201cTerminator\u201d- or \u201cMaximum Overdrive\u201d-like machine rebellion. A joke in the first \u201cCars\u201d referencing Jimi Hendrix makes us wonder if there was an actual Hendrix in the \u201cCars\u201d world and if so, what happened to him. If there are no humans, why do the cars have door handles? The acknowledgement of World War II in \u201cPlanes\u201d raises the question of whether there was a car Hitler, a car Hiroshima, and so on. Likewise, the rural Southern caricatures (many of these cars have bad teeth!) imply that geographical distinctions between the American North and South in our world hold true here as well, which in turns could mean there was a Civil War that pitted car against car, and that their descendants still argue over whether the war was about slavery or state\u2019s rights. (For a primer on these conundrums, see this article by Matt Singer, the Ptolemy of \u201cCars\u201d studies; you can follow it up with this piece suggesting that \u201cCars 3\u201d is a self-aware meditation on Pixar\u2019s own collective fear of aging and irrelevance.)   As examples of imaginative commercial filmmaking, the \u201cCars\u201d films range from mediocre to coldly impressive. The landscapes are photo-realistically convincing, the animators work small miracles making the cars seem lifelike and expressive, and the action sequences are stunning examples of how to deliver a lot of information quickly without confusing the audience. But as pieces of storytelling, the films are borderline inept by the standards of Pixar, a rare studio that exercises auteur-like control over every frame of every project they release. Advertisement And yet, against all odds, there is magic in these films; it just doesn\u2019t have much to do with their excellence as, well, films. That\u2019s a bummer for cinephiles but irrelevant to people seeking a movie filled with broad jokes, flashy action and canned moral lessons that will keep kids occupied for a couple of hours. In the end, it\u2019s more fun to talk about the moon-sized logical loopholes in the \u201cCars\u201d universe than it is to watch a \u201cCars\u201d movie. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s something. At their best, these movies capture the sense of heedless, goofy play that consumed us when we were little. When I was a kid I used to make my Hot Wheels cars fight each other, using their front wheels as fists. Maybe Pixar can work a scene like that into \u201cCars 4.\u201d", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "La La Land", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Musicals made me a romantic. They taught me that some emotion is so powerful that it can\u2019t be put into mere words\u2014it must be sung. Some love is so overwhelming that you just have to move your feet. With a family that loved classic films, I remember being awed by Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, thinking they were as cool as anyone in movie history. Characters in musicals not only understood love differently than those in traditional films but they turned that understanding into art\u2014dancing, singing and transcending mere dialogue to become something greater, something purer, something closer to true romance.  Advertisement We\u2019ve had some musicals since the era of Rogers & Astaire, but few that have tried to recapture that sense of fluid, magical thinking in which characters communicate with their bodies as much, maybe even more, than they do with their voices. One of many remarkable things about Damien Chazelle\u2019s \u201cLa La Land\u201d is how much energy and time it devotes to movement and music, not just lyrics. The modern movie musicals, so often based on Broadway shows, have focused heavily on songs that further plot. In Chazelle\u2019s vision, choreography matters and a simple piano refrain can have more power than a lyric. This is a beautiful film about love and dreams, and how the two impact each other. Los Angeles is filled with dreamers, and sometimes it takes a partner to make your dream come true. \u201cLa La Land\u201d opens with a bit of a fake-out in that it\u2019s a large ensemble number of a variety that we won\u2019t really see again in the movie. Cars are stuck in the notoriously awful L.A. traffic when the drivers decide to break into song called \u201cAnother Day of Sun\u201d\u2014a bit about how each day brings new hope for these young wannabe artists\u2014jumping out of the cars and dancing on the freeway. Instantly, Chazelle\u2019s direction and the dance choreography feels different. Here, and throughout the film, he works in long, unbroken takes. You can not only see the dance moves, but you can see the dancer\u2019s entire body when he or she performs them. And after the chorus-like introduction to a city of dreamers, we meet two such sun-gazers: pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and actress Mia (Emma Stone). Like any good musical, the two have a few false starts and playfully mock each other\u2019s flaws in their first scenes. But we know where this is headed and Gosling & Stone have the chemistry to make us long for them to get together. The first major centerpiece scene is a long walk between Sebastian and Mia as the sun is setting over the Hollywood Hills. They start to see similarities in one another. Mia is tired of going on worthless auditions, ones in which the producer doesn\u2019t even look up from their phone. Sebastian holds on to an ideal version of jazz, wanting to open his own club instead of selling out and playing greatest hits for tourists. And Sebastian and Mia have a clear, instant attraction. So, even as they sing about how they\u2019re not really a couple, and how this gorgeous night is wasted because they\u2019re not with their true partners, their bodies tell another story with a fantastically choreographed dance number. Stone and Gosling aren\u2019t natural singers or dancers, but they bring so much character and commitment to every movement that it doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re fluid, engaged and mesmerizing. We watch them fall in love through dance. Advertisement Of course, it helps that Gosling and Stone have the kind of star power that made so many of those classic era musicals memorable. He\u2019s smooth and charismatic; she\u2019s clever and beautiful. The phrase has lost most of its meaning, but these are movie stars. And, of course, they\u2019re more than capable when \u201cLa La Land\u201d demands greater depth, finding characters so rich that the movie would work without the music. It\u2019s a story of artistic passion, and how easy it is to get derailed from your dream. Sometimes it takes another person to push you back on to the tracks to find it again. Gosling and Stone get these characters, finding grace in their movement but emotional depth in their arcs; Stone has never been better. \u201cLa La Land\u201d also exists as a very conscious ode to the allure of classic Hollywood. The pair goes to see \u201cRebel Without a Cause\u201d (ending in one of the most magical scenes in years) and films like \u201cCasablanca\u201d and \u201cBringing Up Baby\u201d are name-dropped. We have seen dozens of films that try to capture the allure of Hollywood, often with the cynical viewpoint that it will chew you up and spit you out, but Chazelle\u2019s vision feels unique. It pays homage to musicals like \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d and Jacques Demy's \u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\u201d without every directly mimicking them. \u00a0 It\u2019s easy to let the world get you down sometimes, especially in a year like this one. It\u2019s easy to think that dreams don\u2019t come true, and that love only exists in movies. \u201cLa La Land\u201d serves to remind us that movies can still be magical, and they can still provide the channel for us to see magic in the world around us. It\u2019s not so much another day in the sun, as the characters sing in that opening number, but the dreams of the night before, the ones we wake up and try to fulfill, that keep us dancing.

{"Title": "Gett, the Trial of Viviane Amsalem", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "With \"Gett, the Trial of Viviane Amsalem,\" siblings Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz prove that they rank with the finest filmmakers alive.\u00a0 Every shot, cut, line, performance, indeed every moment in this feature is perfectly judged, always conveying precisely what it needs to convey in order to define its characters and move the story forward. And yet the result never seems merely neat or efficient. Even though \"Gett\" tells of 45-year-old Israeli woman seeking a divorce from her domineering husband, and makes unsettling points about what it means to be a woman in a religiously conservative country (or a woman in any society), the film is less an object lesson, lecture, or problem picture than a comedy-drama about the complexity of people and the elusiveness of truth. Advertisement Most of the film takes place in a small courtroom, with the plaintiff, Viviane (co-director Ronit Elkabetz, who's also an accomplished actress), suing her husband Elisha (Simon Abkarian of \"Zero Dark Thirty\") for divorce. For women, divorce is much harder to obtain in Israel than in other Westernized countries. In fact, the husband holds most of the cards and rarely has to lay any of them down. The male-dominated, religiously orthodox panel of judges overseeing the case (led by Rabbi Solomon, played by Mandy Patinkin-lookalike Eli Gornstein) insists on a high standard of proof from Viviane\u2014so high, in fact, that what should be a simple matter of filling out forms becomes an ordeal that would tax the patience of Job.\u00a0 As depicted here, an Israeli woman can't split from her spouse without proving extraordinary abuse or neglect. A simple assertion of \"We don't get along\" or \"This marriage was a mistake\" is not enough. All the husband has do to preserve the status quo is avoid taking action\u2014and that's what Elisha, a magnetic yet tactically aloof man, does in the first part of \"Gett,\" asking for delays, failing to show up in court, and otherwise stonewalling and dragging things out in an attempt to wear Viviane down. He doesn't want to grant her wish. We wonder why. There seems to be little love left between them. Is his intransigence a matter of male pride: the fear of losing face? Or does he truly love her, so much that he'd rather be miserable with her than let her go?\u00a0 The movie keeps us guessing, and even as it tightens the emotional screws, it never stops being enjoyable. That's because the filmmakers treat the courtroom as a golden opportunity for people-watching. Both the judges' elevated bench and the small tables at which the plaintiffs and defendants sit or stand feel like halves of a stage. Viviane and Elisha mostly seethe in silence, listening as their lawyers spar. The barristers are very different but seem evenly matched: pragmatic, skeptical Carmel (Menashe Noy) stumps for the plaintiff; the defendant is represented by his wily and talkative brother Shimon (Sasson Gabai), whose folksy demeanor becomes at once more endearing and more unsettling once you figure out that it's his most potent weapon. \u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement Center stage is a smaller, podium-like table where character witnesses for Viviane and Elisha come to testify. When we get accustomed to the movie's distinctive rhythms, we lean forward in our seats a little bit whenever a new face appears, because we know the character is going to be different from, but as fascinating as, whoever stood there last.\u00a0 Part of the fun lies in watching these witnesses come in with a rehearsed, polished story, only to relinquish it once judges and opposing counsel start poking holes in their facades. The cream of the crop includes Viviane's sister-in-law Rachel, a volcanically spirited woman whose testimony becomes a comic tirade against the inequities of male-female relations and the sham of marriage-as-partnership. There are also great, wise bits of observational humor involving the witnesses' inability or refusal to take direction from the judges.\u00a0 The inertia at the heart of Viviane's plight makes watching \"Gett\" an unexpectedly tense and claustrophobic experience. For a film in which the characters do a lot of talking but not much moving around, and that unfolds in a handful of mostly small and plain locations, it's as relentless as an action-adventure picture. This is partly because the stakes are so basic and clear (Viviane is miserable and depressed, and wants to be free and happy) but also because the filmmakers have chosen to tell the story in a highly, ahem, unorthodox way: by adopting the perspectives of different characters from one moment to the next; positioning their shots so subjectively, and with such geographical precision, that we feel as though we've been dropped into a new consciousness, and allowed to see through fresh eyes. We might wonder why we're seeing a character in profile for several long seconds, or from a very low angle, or partly hidden behind another character's shoulder, and then a cut will establish who's doing the looking, and all at once we find ourselves thinking about what the information at that particular moment means to the person who's seeing and hearing it as it's being delivered. The film's stylistic boldness might not have been necessary: the script is so tight and and propulsive and the large cast so skilled that the moviemakers could have just pointed the camera at the characters and probably created a reasonably thoughtful and engaging drama. But the direction is a masterstroke because it adds a literary or even poetic dimension to the movie, finding a visual analogue to the idea that the truth varies depending on who you are and where you stand.\u00a0 The filmmakers' previous work, \"To Take a Wife\" and \"7 Days,\" were superb as well, but this one is a step up in ambition and exactness. Every touch enriches or builds out the story, and yet \"Gett\" never loses focus on the heroine's plight. We're always with her, and often the throwaway touches are more devastating than the larger setbacks, as when a judge asks her if she wants water, and she politely declines, and a bailiff leaves the room anyway. You just know he's going to return with a glass of water anyway, and sure enough, he does. Rarely has such a simple gesture so clearly communicated what it means to be the heroine in a narrative you cannot control. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Dallas Buyers Club", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "To give credit where it's arguably due, \"Dallas Buyers Club,\" directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e from a screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, takes a different storytelling tack than might be expected of an aspiring-to-inspire based-on-a-true-story drama. Beginning in the mid-1980s, a period cited by journalists and historians as the height of the AIDS crisis in the United States, \"Club\" is about Ron Woodroof, a real-life figure. Woodroof was a hard-partying, ever-on-the-make quasi-cowboy who, on finding himself HIV-infected and with a very-soon-to-come death sentence hanging over him, began aggressively exploring alternative meds. He unwittingly became an advocate and activist, even as he kept himself alive for years longer than any medical experts had told him he could.  Advertisement Woodroof was also, this story tells us, a bigoted redneck who bristled with more than just fear of mortality when he got his diagnosis. \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is not just about Woodroof going up against the FDA and Big Pharma and the other institutions and individuals who kept potentially life-saving drugs from sick people who needed them; it is of course also about Woodroof's Growth As A Human Being, and how this growth allows him to work side by side with a flamboyant transsexual, a person he not only wouldn't have given the time of day to in his prior mode of life, but possibly would have given a beatdown to.  But while it highlights performances by both Matthew McConaughey (as Woodroof) and Jared Leto (as the wily, poignant transsexual Rayon) that are models of both emotional and physical commitment (both actors shed alarming amounts of weight to portray the ravages the disease wreaks on their characters), \"Dallas Buyers Club\" largely goes out of its way to eschew button-pushing and tear-jerking. Shot mostly in a direct, near-documentary style, but edited with a keen feel for the subjectivity of its main characters, \"Dallas Buyers Club\" takes a more elliptical, near-poetic approach to the lives it portrays than the viewer might expect from this kind of movie.  As I mentioned at the start of the review, the approach is admirable in theory. In practice, though, it's sometimes mildly frustrating. The struggles of people suffering from AIDS in America were epic, and involved a Physician's Desk Reference worth of meds, and a near-army of regulations and regulatory agencies; that's a lot of data for one two-hour drama, and McConaughey's character has to act as both an audience surrogate and a hero, but he's also a man struggling with potent demons. Vall\u00e9e's energetic direction keeps the narrative moving, and there's a real rush when Woodroof's hustling pays off with the creation of the movie's title entity, a sort of medical co-op that gets non-approved meds into the hands of the sick people the health care system can't or won't help.  Advertisement The moment-to-moment approach gets choppy sometimes, as when Woodroof is suddenly portrayed in a slick international-drug-smuggler mode; one gets the impression of being in a different movie. Vall\u00e9e also misjudges, I think, the scenes in which to lay on the portent, as the scene in which Woodroof muddles through his past to figure out how he got infected, and flashes back to a rather overly boogity-boogity scene in which Woodroof has aggressively unprotected sex with two women, one of whom is a junkie. On the other end of a particular spectrum, the movie's potential nod to sentiment, in the form of a potential romance between Woodroof and one of the few helpful/compassionate physicians he encounters (Jennifer Garner, who does good, understated work), seems a little half-hearted. I understand these sound like quibbles, but I'm trying to come to terms with why \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is a somewhat more dry experience than I suspect it wants to be. The movie certainly does crackle courtesy of McConaughey. Even as his character is physically wasting away, the actor is unfailing in his portrayal of Woodroof's never-say-die indomitability, and is also unimpeachable in conveying the dangerous sleazoid charm that's a carryover from Woodroof's former footloose existence.  While Jared Leto's Rayon is often used as Woodroof's foil, Leto's attentive, detail-oriented portrayal of the fragile but supremely street-smart Buyers Club partner gives the character a distinct autonomy. The cast is packed with great actors (Steve Zahn, Dallas Roberts, Griffin Dunne and Denis O'Hare among then) buckling down, and that's key to the movie's pleasures. If \"Dallas Buyers Club\" falls somewhat short in the categories of historical chronicle, emotional wallop, and information delivery, its conscientious attempts to portray a group of people in trouble in a troubled time delivers mini-epiphanies in a series of small doses. And that isn't nothing.", "Critic": "Gamma"}

Advertisement \u201cMy Life Directed\u201d opens with the scene that gave me my\r\nbiggest smile over the entire piece as Refn and the great Alejandro Jodorowsky\r\nare having a conversation that ends with the influential filmmaker giving him a\r\ntarot card reading about his soon-to-shoot follow-up to \u201cDrive.\u201d Just the idea\r\nthat Refn and Jodorowsky hang out (he comes back later in the film and fans will remember Refn was a memorable interview subject in \"Jodorowsky's Dune\") talking\r\nabout life, art, and craft fascinates me, and I was hoping the film would\r\nfulfill on that opening scene, featuring the kind of intellectual dissection of passion versus expectation that this introduction sets up. Sadly, director Liv\r\nCorfixen, who also happens to be Refn\u2019s wife, never finds the focus for her\r\npiece, sketching the production in episodic, brief interludes with her partner\r\nbut seemingly missing the most important conversations about how \u201cOnly God\r\nForgives\u201d got made. What separates \u201cMy Life Directed\u201d is the fact that while\r\nCorfixen may not have gotten the kind of Jodo-Refn conversations one would hope\r\nfor, she gets a raw, unfiltered, husband version of a world-renowned filmmaker.\r\nSo, we see Refn in bed, clearly wracked by nerves as to how \u201cOnly God Forgives\u201d\r\nwill be received by the rest of the world. He clearly loves the film, but he is\r\nobsessed, from pre-production through premiere night, with the idea that\r\naudiences will be disappointed in the fact that it\u2019s not \u201cDrive 2.\u201d This documentary\r\nmay work best viewed in conjunction with the feature because one could easily\r\nargue that the film\u2019s flaws sprung from the filmmaker\u2019s lack of confidence in\r\nhis own vision. Which brings us back to the idea that \u201cMy Life Directed by\r\nNicolas Winding Refn\u201d is a great special feature, or a bonus disc in an\r\ninevitable box set of Refn\u2019s works.

{"Title": "The Walk", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "In terms of sheer directorial craft, \"The Walk\" is masterful, but as storytelling, it's a near-disaster. That's too bad, because nobody does visceral like Robert Zemeckis. Even in his less-than-great films, there are always two or three sequences that dazzle the viewer, often by evoking the sights and sounds of an extraordinary experience in such a way that you feel as if you're participating in them along with the characters. \"The Walk,\" Zemeckis' account of Phillippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the Twin Towers of the old World Trade Center, would seem to be the ultimate Zemeckis set piece, rivaling the awesomeness of the plane crash and island sequences of \"Cast Away,\" the upside-down jet maneuver in \"Flight,\" the intergalactic wormhole trips in \"Contact,\" and the small-scaled relentlessness of the suspense sequences in his under-appreciated 2000 thriller \"What Lies Beneath\" (which wrung tremendous excitement from the question of whether a nearly paralyzed woman could use her big toe to remove the stopper from a bathtub drain).  Advertisement The final half-hour of \"The Walk\" is on that level. It's hard to imagine how it could have done a better job imagining every physical detail of the hero's unmatched physical achievement. Following the movie's New York Film Festival premiere, there were reports of people throwing up in the men's room after suffering virtual vertigo while watching Petit (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) stroll, turn and even lie down upon a cable stretched between the towers. In this respect, \"The Walk\" does not disappoint. Zemeckis is on a short list, along with Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock, of filmmakers who understand how to fuse audacity with simplicity, so that the scale of the flourishes in their biggest sequences is wed to recognizable emotions. He makes sure that you don't just understand how Petit did what he did, but what he might have been feeling during every step of his journey, and what he saw and heard. The metallic creak of the cable as Petit walks; the rustle and hiss of wind passing over his clothes and through his hair; the muffled sound of traffic noises floating up from 110 stories below: \"The Walk\" makes these and other sensations palpable, along with Petit's delight, defiance and moments of doubt and fear.  If only Zemeckis had faith in his filmmaking power! What \"The Walk\" is missing, unfortunately, is an ability to recognize when poetry and mystery are enough and should be left alone to breathe. Here is a movie about a man whose life was defined by a \r\ndaring, unprecedented and now un-repeatable artistic feat (transforming boxy skyscrapers into a stage high above \r\nNorth America's largest city) and who achieved that feat by trusting in his \r\ntraining and bravery and will. But the script, credited to Zemeckis and Christopher Browne, begins diminishing his achievement immediately with tedious chatter, and can't stop doing it.  The movie kicks off with a poorly CGI'd (for Zemeckis) shot of the hero standing in the \r\nStatue of Liberty's torch with the Towers looming across the water \r\nbehind him, talking and talking and talking not to you but at you, often in bizarrely \r\ngargoyle-ish close-ups, about the amazing thing he's about to do, or is doing\u2014as if convincing us to buy a ticket to the film we're already sitting there watching.  \"You're doing too much!\" warns the hero's mentor (scene-stealer Ben Kingsley) early in the movie. \"Do nothing!\" The movie ignores its own advice. If the point were to show how the hucksterish aspect of Petit diminished \r\nhis physical feats, and paint a portrait of an insufferable and in some \r\nways untrustworthy salesman-adventurer who's in love with himself, it might have been defensible, but \r\nthat's not the case. We're supposed to take everything Petit says \r\nat face value. We're supposed to adore him. His narration is an \r\ninsurance policy intended to guarantee audience involvement and make sure we never fail to understand any point.  Advertisement \"The Walk\" starts selling itself to you the second you settle into your chair (\"To walk on the wire, this is life!\" Petit tells us, jamming his face into the lens). It keeps selling and selling and selling itself, telling you how amazing and wondrous everything is via voice-over and straight-into-the-camera narration, verbally explaining things that Zemeckis' images are already doing a peerless job of showing you, sometimes breaking the movie's spell by having the hero chime in with an observation that's nowhere near as eloquent as the sight of Petit doing what only Petit can do. Petit's narration might be the most counterproductive and irritating narration ever to be glommed onto a potentially great motion picture. Suffering through it is like visiting the Grand Canyon or the Metropolitan Museum of Art with someone who keeps exclaiming how incredible and astonishing everything is every fifteen seconds, to the point where you want to leave and come back the next day by yourself so that you have an actual experience. \"And with this pencil stroke, my fate was sealed,\" the narration tells us, over images of Petit drawing a line between the towers as depicted in a magazine ad that he peruses while waiting to see a doctor\u2014as if we couldn't figure out why that moment is important, in a movie about a guy who tightrope-walked between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. \"This is the beginning of my dream!\" The nadir of the movie's poor judgment occurs during its still-mostly-astonishing climax, when Petit lies down on the cable, engulfed in misty cloud cover, and watches a lone gull hovers over him and seems to stare into his eyes, as if wondering if he's some kind of bird, too. The moment has the eerie mesmerizing power of an incantation, but sure enough, here comes Petit in voice-over telling us about how this bird came out of the clouds and hovered there over him and dammit, movie, don't you know we have eyes and ears? I don't believe in the admonition \"show, don't tell.\" It's a maxim cited by hack screenwriters who make money from how-to books and seminars, not from actual screenwriting. Some of the greatest films in cinema history have active, insistent, even constant narration. But such films are not just telling in place of showing. They're showing while they're telling and telling while they're showing, and the verbal component adds to, and often complicates or subverts, the images and sounds. That's not the case here. Aside from a few practical observations about being an acrobat, there is nary a word of Petit's narration that couldn't be red-lined for redundancy. If what you want is to hear people talk about Petit (including Petit), you might as well buy a copy of the memoir upon which the \"The Walk\" is based, or watch James Marsh's great 2008 nonfiction film \"Man on Wire,\" which includes so many re-enactments that it's half a drama, anyway.  Advertisement \"The Walk\" is worth seeing on a big screen for its final wire walk (intrusive voice-over notwithstanding), for its lovingly recreated images of the World Trade Center, for its often wry humor (including a marvelous running gag involving an elevator operator) and for some of the supporting performances (notably Kingsley's pitch-perfect mentor performance, and James Badge Dale's turn as a wise-ass Franco-American who joins the team infiltrating the towers). Gordon-Levitt is verbally miscast (his Franch acc-SANT is too theatrical and might make you wish they'd cast an actual French actor) but physically convincing; you buy him as a man driven to achieve the impossible, and willing to do the hard work necessary to hone his skills, and you also believe him as a charismatic, selfish leader whose hint of madness is as attractive as it is troubling. But this is ultimately a frustrating work. \"The Walk\" has everything it needs to be a modern classic, except for an understanding that when you have everything you need to make a such a film, it doesn't need to hype itself and explain itself. It can just be.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Blackfish", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Blackfish\" is the newest example of subgenre of documentaries that could be the 21st century animal rights version of abolitionist pamphlets. \u00a0\"Sharkwater,\" about the organized butchery of sharks, \"The Cove,\" about the mistreatment of dolphins, and Gabriela Cowperthwaite's new film about orcas aren't subtle, but they aren't trying to be. They aim to document abuse and inspire reform.\u00a0 Where 2009's\u00a0\"The Cove\" exposed the theme park chain's role in dolphin kidnapping, abuse and slaughter, \"Blackfish\" does the same with orcas. It uses\u00a0Sea World trainer\u00a0Dawn Brancheau's 2010 death in a killer whale tank as a springboard for a tale of decades-long corporate conspiracy. Sea World is its main target, but the film also wants to attack received wisdom about humankind's dominion over nature, and make us feel guilty for treating fellow sentient beings as clowns.\u00a0 Advertisement Once you accept that orcas are intelligent and emotionally complex creatures, it becomes impossible to shrug off the film's darker factoids as the cost of keeping families entertained.\u00a0We learn how whale families, or pods, are hunted in their natural habitat, and how calves are separated from their parents, and how some pod members are killed on the spot. A grey-haired seaman recalls a sea park-financed calf hunt that ended with cow and bull carcasses being stuffed with rocks so that they'd sink the ocean floor. He weeps at the memory, and says it's the worst act he's ever been part of.\u00a0 The more we learn about the lives or orcas in captivity, the more inevitable the violence seems. \u00a0The confinement of mammals that are meant to roam free over hundreds of kilometers; the \"training\" that requires them to do tricks on command or be punished with solitary confinement and the withholding of food; the whale-on-whale violence caused partly by orcas being forced to share tight space in tanks with orcas that they might not choose to associate with in the wild: these and other facts make the marine park sound like a combination circus, super-max prison and slave labor camp. (Oddly, the parallels to slavery, while impossible to miss, are the only aspect of this expose that are allowed to emerge organically from the material.)\u00a0 Tilikum, the bull that killed Brancheau, has a history of violence, but given what he's been through we can hardly blame him. An appalling moment in \"The Cove\" revealed how a dolphin who played Flipper on TV got so depressed in captivity that she killed herself. You may be reminded that humans hang themselves in jail under less dire circumstances than these mammals endure. There's only so much abuse that a being can take without wanting to kill someone, or itself.\u00a0 Cowperthwaite, her editor Eli B. Despres (who also cowrote the movie) and her composer Jeff Beal invoke many genres: thriller, mystery, melodrama, snuff film. There are cartoon recreations of a court case pitting Sea World against the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which forced the park to keep whales and trainers separate. There are graphic images of trainers being mauled and whales being \"raked\" by fellow whales in captivity, blood clouding the water.\u00a0 Advertisement There were times when I wished \"Blackfish\" would trust its audience more. The archival bits\u2014 including robotically cheerful testimonials from a \"typical\" Sea World-loving family and\u00a0a 1985 TV ad trumpeting the arrival of \"Baby Shamu\"\u2014are so corrosively funny that they might have been spliced in from a Paul Verhoeven picture.\u00a0The shots of whales lashing out in desperation and the closeups of tearful trainers begging forgiveness for their role in past abuse are innately powerful. Arguably none of these elements needed to be \"helped\" with \"Monday Night Football\"-style gimmicks and \"you will cry now\" music; but the filmmakers could counter with Malcolm X's \"by any means necessary\"\u2014and perhaps they should. Sea World has issued a\u00a0point-by-point refutation\u00a0of some the charges. I doubt they'll reclaim sympathy by quibbling over details when the rough outlines of the orca trade are so grotesque.\u00a0A third of the way through \"Blackfish,\" I imagined myself as a child watching my family being murdered, then growing up in a prison where I had to do degrading tricks for cheering crowds who'd been assured that I adored the place.

{"Title": "Mojave", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Mojave\" opens with Garrett Hedlund, with only slightly\r\nscruffier hair and beard than Ted Neeley had in \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d\r\ncomplaining to a video camera about the ennui of having been world famous since\r\nthe age of 19, and then elaborating on that discontent: \u201cYou wanna be like\r\nByron, you wanna go to Greece, you wanna run guns in Africa,\" that last bit alluding\r\nto Rimbaud\u2019s post-\u201cA Season In Hell\u201d career.

This fellow, Jack, played by Oscar Isaac, grins, but as Hedlund\u2019s Thomas, he glowers. What the\r\nhell is going on here? Advertisement What can I tell you? When a literary author whose career in\r\nbook-writin\u2019 has been kinda-sorta hijacked by Hollywood, weird feelings tend to fester under the affluent lifestyle.\r\nFor this film, the second to be both written and directed by William Monahan,\r\nturns out to not be the Academy-Award-winning screenwriter\u2019s homage to Gus Van\r\nSant\u2019s \u201cGerry,\u201d but a revenge thriller set largely in the fleshpits of\r\nTinseltown. What happens is, surly Thomas gets a\r\nbit of a jump on Jack, but in the process kills another man, an\r\ninnocent\u2014although in the world Monahan envisions, no one is truly innocent,\r\nexcept maybe the six-year-old kid who rather predictably melts into a father\u2019s\r\nembrace in the movie\u2019s coda.\u00a0 Discovering that there\u2019s a serial killer roaming\r\nthe very desert he\u2019s leaving (he called a limo from a motel), Thomas, remaining\r\nsurly, goes back to Hollywood, secretes a revolver in the platform of his TV\r\ndisplay (on which he watches the Death Valley climax of Erich von Stroheim\u2019s \u201cGreed,\u201d\r\na totally typical touch), and consults with sleazy lawyer Walton Googins and\r\nargues with sleazier studio head Mark Wahlberg, and has desultory sex with\r\naloof and not-his-wife French Person Louise Bourgoin. But this is not enough\r\nHell on Earth for Thomas. Jack finds an address on the abandoned Jeep\u2019s\r\nregistration, says \u201cGame on,\u201d and hitchhikes to L.A., to engage in some\r\noccasionally \u201cStrangers On A Train\u201d style cat-and-mouse with Thomas. Monahan\u2019s conception of Thomas as an unlikable but\r\nnevertheless idealized imperial artist\u2014the film director as Calvin Klein model,\r\nKurt Cobain and Jim Morrison combined, only as well read as Harold Bloom\u2014is\r\nonly slightly less ridiculous than his conception of Jack as Thomas\u2019 secret\r\nsharer, an artist-manqu\u00e9-turned-killer of similar erudition. (At one point Jack\r\nbrags of having a \u201cJohn Stuart Mill\u201d-level IQ.) There is something kind of funny about these two bro-styled men arguing\r\nabout the accuracy of a George Bernard Shaw quote while kicking the crap out of\r\neach other, but I\u2019m not sure how much Monahan knows that, smart as he is. Like\r\nClifford Odets in his stage play \u201cThe Big Knife,\u201d Monahan sees show-biz decadence as\r\npractically apocalyptic. \"Who\u2019s the author surrogate?\" you may wonder. And this\r\nis part of the point. When Jack says, to a dog, \u201cThe Internet is a pain in the\r\nass. One can\u2019t give it too much of a place in one\u2019s life. It is a tool,\u201d well,\r\nthere\u2019s a clue right there. But eventually you figure he\u2019s got to fess up and\r\ngive his loyalty to the guy who\u2019s actually got some IMDB credits. Or does he?\r\n\u201cDo you know yet which one of us is the Bad Guy?\u201d one of the characters asks at\r\na tense moment; Monahan clearly wants to get maximum mileage out of that\r\nquestion.

Of the two leads, it\u2019s the impossibly sly and\r\ncharismatic Isaac, as you may have guessed, who has the upper hand, and he\r\nclearly relishes reeling off Monahan\u2019s loquacious dialogue, which makes a point\r\nof flirting with the most eyeroll-inducing pretensions. Wahlberg is pretty\r\nfunny playing a thoroughly repellent wannabe mogul (movie inside-baseball nuts\r\nwill be diverted by some obvious clues as to which real-life figure the\r\ncharacter might be based on) while Bourgoin is boldly non-ingratiating as the\r\nShallow Girlfriend In Peril.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Meru", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The connection between the legendary George Mallory and\r\nrenowned climber Conrad Anker, one of the subjects \u201cMeru\u201d is more than just\r\nhistorical. Believe it or not, Anker is the man who found Mallory\u2019s body on\r\nMount Everest in 1999, which made headlines around the world. Anker also seems\r\nto wholeheartedly subscribe to the theory captured by Mallory\u2019s three most\r\nfamous words: \u201cBecause it\u2019s there.\u201d In\r\nthat oft-quoted phrase, so much of the human desire to surmount the impossible\r\nis captured. Although the quote is often misinterpreted as a way to offer proof\r\nof inconsequential reasons to do what logic tells us we should not. Another\r\ninterpretation is that there aren\u2019t words to capture why people go to the Moon,\r\ncome back from the brink of death, or climb Mount Everest. They just do.\r\nBecause it\u2019s there. The men of \u201cMeru\u201d tried to go to a place that all common\r\nsense dictated they should not. They tried to climb a sheer wall that no one\r\nhad ever climbed before. Their story is undeniably interesting. However, and\r\nthis is the tricky part about reviewing documentaries, the movie about that\r\nstory is flawed. A bit too much time is spent in admiration and hero worship\r\nover the indefatigable will of these men, when it is the footage on that\r\nmountainside that matters. It\u2019s a story that speaks for itself, and so the\r\nemphasis on talking heads explaining it to us is dispiriting.  Advertisement The Shark\u2019s Fin on Mount Meru has long been the ultimate\r\nprize in mountain climbing. It is a ridiculous creation of Mother Nature,\r\nperched over 20,000 feet above the Ganges River and essentially flat and\r\nstraight-up. It is not a mountain; it is a wall. At the most challenging part\r\nof its ascent, climbers often travel 200 meters in ONE DAY. That\u2019s the\r\ninch-by-inch progress it takes to get to the top. And if you plan poorly or\r\nmerely get hit by bad weather, you better turn around if you ever want to see\r\nyour family again. As explained in the film, it is the anti-Everest in that\r\nthere are no Sherpas. No help. No one to do the grunt work. You are on your own\r\nclimbing a smooth, featureless face. In October 2008, Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin (credited with\r\nco-directing \u201cMeru\u201d) and Renan Ozturk tried to tackle Meru. They filmed much of\r\nthe perilous journey, and this material is easily the strongest in \u201cMeru.\u201d When\r\nthe filmmakers stop the musical score and stop the narration, and simply allow\r\nus to listen to the wind and the snow pummeling these men, the physical\r\nchallenge is palpable. The trio failed in 2008. In a remarkable scene, they look\r\nalmost close enough to the summit to touch it, but they figure out that the sun\r\nwill set soon, they have nowhere to camp, and they would not survive the\r\nconditions. They look like they literally could throw something to the top, but\r\nthey have to turn back and go all the way back down. They were 100 meters away.\r\n Defeated, it looks unlikely that the trio will go back\r\nagain. In an interesting footnote not given enough attention, Jimmy reveals\r\nthat it was the failure of another group of climbers to reach the top that\r\nreally got him thinking about attempting it again. There\u2019s something so\r\nattractive about being the first.\r\nRisking your life to be #2 isn\u2019t as exciting. And so after some remarkable\r\nspeed bumps are placed in their way but surpassed, the trio takes another shot\r\nat it. \u201cMeru\u201d works best, by far, in its \u201cYou Are There\u201d moments.\r\nYou hear heavy breathing, the elements whip the tent, and it sounds like the\r\nworld is ending. At one point in the first climb\u2014and it\u2019s really why it failed\u2014they\r\nare stuck, literally, on the side of the mountain for FOUR DAYS, as the\r\nelements made it impossible to move.

Looking over Cage\u2019s resume, I considered the\r\nfollowing phrase carefully: \u201cPay the Ghost,\u201d out in very limited release today,\r\nis a new low for Nicolas Cage. Just when you thought he couldn\u2019t get any more apathetic\r\nabout a role, he pops up in this lazy, boring retread of \u201cInsidious\u201d that even\r\nhis most diehard fans should ignore.  Advertisement Based on a novella by Tim Lebbon, \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d stars Cage\r\nas Mike Lawford, an English teacher who drops references to Lovecraft and Johann\r\nWolfgang von Goethe just so you get the impression that Dan Kay\u2019s screenplay\r\ncomes with great literary aspirations. (Spoiler: It does not.) Lawford is married to Kristen (Sarah\r\nWayne Callies), and the two have a child named Charlie (Jack Fulton). Of\r\ncourse, Mike is a distant dad, not around enough as he tries to earn tenure at\r\nthe university where he teaches. On Halloween, Lawford finally gets tenure, and comes home to celebrate with his family. He even\r\nconvinces his wife to let him take Charlie to a late-night Halloween parade (do\r\nthose things really happen in NYC in 2015?)

Is Charlie trying to\r\ncommunicate to them from the other side? With a laughably small amount of\r\nresearch, Mike notices that while children who go missing are often found,\r\nthose who disappear on All Hallow\u2019s Eve rarely come home again. Someone, or\r\nsomething, is abducting kids on October 31st, and many of the\r\nguardians of the abductees tell the same story of the titular phrase being said\r\njust before they disappeared. Who is the ghost that must be paid? What must he\r\nor she be paid with? Does this have something to do with Cage\u2019s notorious IRS\r\nproblems? It\u2019s amazing how long \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d drags itself through a feature-length running time with almost nothing to speak of in terms of plot.\r\nCharlie disappears, and dad looks for him. The set-up is a slog, as we know\r\nthere\u2019s no movie without dad making contact with his son again, and there\u2019s\r\nabsolutely no style or character to get us over the lack of narrative suspense.\r\nCage doesn\u2019t even give it his wide-eyed all; he\u2019s more fun in \u201cLeft Behind.\u201d\r\nPerhaps presuming that director Uli Edel would actually dramatically ground \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d\r\nin something relatable, Cage actually plays it straight, which eliminates any\r\nB-movie fun that could even be had with this misstep.

{"Title": "Filth", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 1994 \"Pulp Fiction\" gets a lot of grief for wellspringing, that is, for inspiring a container ship gross of (largely) inferior \"edgy\" genre pictures overstuffed with blood, guts, octane, and classic rock soundtracks. To spread around disapprobation where it\u2019s due, I think the 1996 film version of Irvine Welch\u2019s novel \"Trainspotting,\" as good a film as that was, also brought into being a subgenre that got real tired real fast, a subgenre involving the gritty and repellent depiction of a world of sex and drugs, a depiction that also partakes of a certain giggly amorality (calling itself \"anarchy,\" or something more high-minded), while playing that against an occasional po-faced assessment of the consequences of such a mode of life. Facile \"pungent\" irony and alternative rock soundtracks optional.  Advertisement In 2014, there\u2019s actually something mildly anachronistic about \"Filth,\" writer-director Jon B. Laird\u2019s adaptation of a 1998 novel by Welch. The movie\u2019s opening credits play over a retro-lounge rendition of \"Winter Wonderland.\" There\u2019s a low-angle shot of what appears to be the world\u2019s longest dressing room floor, black and white chessboard tile, and at the end of the line, a beautiful woman in lingerie with her back to the camera is putting on lipstick, looking at herself in the mirror. It\u2019s all very 1995 imagining it\u2019s 1957. When DOES this movie take place, anyway? The fact that its lead character, Bruce Robertson, is seen watching a television program (or \"programme\" as they say across the pond; the movie is set and was made in Scotland) featuring papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 headed character Frank Sidebottom suggests late \u201880s-early \u201890s. The fact that he\u2019s watching said programme while masturbating and making an obscene phone call to the unsuspecting wife of a \"friend\" says a bit about Bruce\u2019s character, of course. He\u2019s a cop, a bad one, and he\u2019s gunning for promotion, and his obscene phone call stunt is one of the many machinations he\u2019s using to achieve that aim. Or so he believes.  To be fair to \"Filth,\" which boasts a creditable cast featuring James McAvoy (in the lead role), Jamie Bell, Eddie Marsan, Imogen Poots, Jim Broadbent, and others, the movie is not exactly what its initial flurry of sarcastic voiceover (\"When did a single-figure IQ ever hold anyone back in the police force?\"), cheeky irony, and unrelenting depiction of drinking and drugging make it seem. It\u2019s actually something just a bit worse. Rather than a how-sweet-to-be-a-lout story that turns semi-cautionary, \"Filth\" attempts to depict genuine madness. More than merely an out-of-control sybarite prone to the corrupting influences of power, Robertson is supposed to be a Genuinely Broken Man. One who Used To Be Good. Or at least Had Potential. I understand such things do happen in life, but in \"Filth,\" the movie, such things are laid out in ways that become almost reliably predictable and unenlightening. A side trip for the lead characters to Hamburg ends with the boys chased out of a sex club to the strains of \"99 Luftballoons,\" can you believe it?  As the movie goes on, what had at first blush seemed a Macbeth-type scheme on Robertson\u2019s part is revealed to be a complete non-starter, and the viewer is ostensibly plunged into the character\u2019s tortured psyche. But there\u2019s nothing really revealing therein, just more pastiche; a character who morphs into a version of Carroll\u2019s White Rabbit, a dialogue exchange that turns into a musical number. McAvoy\u2019s nudge-nudge performance has a similarly tired quality. \"Filth\" demonstrates that contemporary filmmakers would do well to find \r\nnew ways of getting their hands dirty. On the plus side, a viewing of \r\nthe movie might temporarily cure just about anyone\u2019s nostalgia for the \r\nmud.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Divorce Corp", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The inevitable DVD of \"Divorce Corp\" will make an ideal gift for anyone who's been through a painful, expensive split-up. Directed by Joseph Sorge, whose web site offers a tie-in book, it's billed as \"A shocking expos\u00e9 of the inner workings of the $50 billion a year U.S. family law industry\" that \"shines a bright light on the appalling waste, and shameless collusive practices seen daily in family courts.\"  Those intensifiers should tell you what you're in for. \"Divorce Corp\" is less a nuanced documentary than a cry of rage. It's easy to imagine people who've shelled out a small fortune during a contested divorce, with or without kids underfoot, watching this film while nodding their heads and muttering, \"Amen. Stick it to 'em.\"  Advertisement Although it sometimes wanders off the righteous path to recount a depressing or perverse anecdote at length\u2014such as the tale of a ridiculously expensive child custody evaluator who bragged of drug use and unprotected group sex on Facebook\u2014for the most part it's a stylistically bland work. \"Divorce Corp\" is directed and edited at roughly the same level of imagination as a network newsmagazine story: talking head, talking head, talking head, cut to a chart, exterior shot of a courthouse, cut to another chart, talking head, capped by a segue along the lines of, \"And if you think that's shocking, wait'll you hear this.\"  Any wit it exhibits is of the slow-twisting-of-the-knife variety. A sequence that picks apart the undefined legal phrase \"the best interest of the child\" is scored to a section of \"March of the Sugarplum Fairies.\" Animated re-creations of witnesses' stories contain odd moments of caricature, as when a faceless stick figure representing a child custody evaluator takes a parent's hard-earned money and bolts like a cartoon swindler trying to make the next train out of town. That said, I'd be shocked if anyone involved with \"Divorce Corp\" gave the briefest thought to making an artistic statement. This picture is just a statement, period\u2014something like, \"Divorce in the United States is needlessly complicated, expensive, unfair, and sometimes corrupt. Won't someone do something about it, for pity's sake?\" The damning facts and figures keep piling up, along with horror stories that give them human faces. The average contested divorce in the United State of America costs $50,000. Lawyers on both sides of a case crank out redundant paperwork, unnecessary motions and pointless letters because they get paid by the hour. Costs climb so high that soon-to-be-former spouses have to sell cars, houses and other possessions to pay legal fees, and sometimes judges pre-emptively denude their net worth by placing liens on their property. Nobody involved wants to end what this movie calls \"the revenue stream.\" Judges are officially or unofficially in bed with lawyers for both spouses, as well as the various experts they assign to cases. It's a mutual backscratching thing. If the judge takes care of these people today, once the judge retires the recipients of largesse will take care of him, perhaps by hiring him to serve as a mediator or consultant.  Advertisement Adding incompetence to corruption, the family court system is a steaming mess. Its various sections aren't governed by constitutional edicts that other institutions must follow. Power-tripping judges can indulge God complexes by lashing out against plaintiffs who protest their decisions. At one point the film tells of a man who wrote about his experiences in family court online and was ordered to delete his blog by the judge overseeing his divorce. This is but one of many examples the film gives of judges behaving like old-time ward bosses or petty gangsters. There are no stories in \"Divorce Corp\" of fair judges or decent lawyers or government employees who are good at their jobs, and little analysis of the larger systemic problems that might account for some of the horror stories. It's not that kind of film.  The fact that \"Divorce Corp\" is railing against targets that it's safe to hate (cold-hearted and anonymous institutions, incompetent evaluators, sleazy lawyers, corrupt or petty judges) gives it darkly exhilarating quality. If you want to let off steam, it's cheaper to go out into a field and scream your head off than to buy a ticket to see it; but then you wouldn't have the pleasure of seeing prominent lawyer Gloria Allred admit on camera that the goal of most attorneys in divorce cases is to \"paper the other side until they can't take it anymore.\" If this movie were a person, it would be the kind of person you'd avoid because you fear he might explode one day and you'd rather not be there when it happens.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Light Between Oceans", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Great drama requires trust. The director has to trust his actors to convey the complexity of the human experience without smothering their performances in manipulative filmmaking devices. He also has to trust the viewer to bring their own interpretations and emotions to the story, meeting the characters halfway along the spectrum of the human experience. Derek Cianfrance can\u2019t find this trust in \u201cThe Light Between Oceans,\" an adaptation of M.L. Stedman\u2019s novel. It's a film with greatness within that\u2019s been lost due to varying degrees of distrust; ridiculously tight close-ups in soft focus feel like they\u2019re pushing you to cry instead of allowing emotion to come organically. Narrative beats and themes are hit repeatedly, just to make sure you don\u2019t miss an opportunity to feel something. Buried beneath this melodrama\u2014but shining through nearly enough to justify a look\u2014one can see the film that could have been, as anchored by great performances and emotional truth. It\u2019s just lost in the fog. Advertisement Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender, giving a very measured, confident performance) is a World War I veteran battling Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder before his condition really had a name. In some of the film\u2019s best scenes, we learn that Tom has been burdened by the randomness of life and death. Why did he live but his fellow soldiers die? One almost gets the sense that Tom doesn\u2019t think he \u201cdeserves\u201d to have made it home, and that he\u2019s going to spend the rest of his life in solitude, refusing to take the creature comforts that other young men lost forever when they went to war. To that end, Tom signs up to take a job that not many would want, manning an extremely remote lighthouse in Australia, at a spot in which one can see two oceans from its top. The last lighthouse keeper was fired when he told someone that he allowed his wife to signal a passing ship. The break in protocol was a small problem\u2014the fact that his wife had been dead a few years was a much bigger one. And yet this not-at-all-coveted job changes Tom\u2019s life when he meets the daughter of his new boss, a headstrong and beautiful young lady named Isabel (Alicia Vikander). Before long, Isabel and Tom are married, planning to start a family on Janus Island. Isabel gets pregnant, but loses the baby in a heartbreaking scene in which Tom is in the lighthouse and she can\u2019t get to him. She gets pregnant again. Tragedy strikes again.  While Isabel and Tom are mourning the loss of their second child, a miracle happens. A rowboat washes ashore, carrying a dead body and a baby. No one on the mainland knows that Isabel lost the second baby. They could just take this new child as their own and no one would know any differently. At first, the plan seems to work perfectly as Isabel, Tom, and their new daughter Lucy find happiness, but a visit to the mainland forces an encounter between Tom and a mysterious woman (Rachel Weisz) that changes everything. Advertisement Derek Cianfrance has undeniable skill with actors, drawing masterful performances out of Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams in \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d and his large ensemble in the highly underrated \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines.\u201d That skill is evident here mostly in Fassbender\u2019s largely internal turn. His take on Tom is often stoic, haunted by the ghosts of World War I in a way that makes him quiet, sometimes uncertain. Vikander often goes in the other direction, offering the more extreme emotions that Tom keeps hidden, but she\u2019s rarely given the room to breathe life into the performance. And I mean that almost literally. Cianfrance and cinematographer Adam Arkapaw put us right in her face in extreme close-up, thinking that this will help force an audience response. It\u2019s distracting more than effective, as is the soft focus and overcooked score by Alexandre Desplat. When Arkapaw and Cianfrance let their characters breathe, or even when they admire the gorgeous landscape, the film feels more effective and less manipulative. Ultimately, it comes back to trust. Don\u2019t force us to feel, trust that we will do so.\u00a0This is a film that I kept wanting to emotionally connect with and give myself over to the human power of its tragedy, but it kept pushing me away. With the undeniable, unwavering skill of the trio of actors at the film's center, we would have followed them through this heartbreaking tale without the signposts that tell us what to feel along the way.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Matt Shepard Is a Friend of Mine", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Matt Shepard is a Friend of Mine\" is a great documentary. It might face an uphill battle to be seen, because it revisits\u00a0a crime that sparked\u00a0national\u00a0reckoning\u00a0with the\u00a0reality\u00a0of homophobia, and that eventually led to the creation of The Matthew Shepard Foundation and the passage of the\u00a0Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\u00a0I hope people discover it. It is wrenching but never exploitive. It\u00a0is impressively skeptical of the same mission that it takes on its shoulders: to make something positive from a senseless crime without\u00a0diminishing\u00a0its senselessness. This film doesn't just revisit an atrocity, it moves through it, and finds meaning in it.\u00a0 Advertisement The story starts on the night of\u00a0Oct. 12, 1998, when Shepard, a 21-year old college student, was offered a ride home by two young men,\u00a0Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, then tied to a fence, viciously beaten, and abandoned. Shepard died of his injuries. In the ensuing trial,\u00a0McKinney\u2019s lawyer tried to keep his client out of prison through the \"gay-panic defense,\" in which defendants who think they've been the object of homosexual advances claim they were seized by \"a\u00a0psychotic state characterized by unusual violence.\"\u00a0 Director Michele Josue, who knew Shepard, frames the story as\u00a0her own meditation on Shepard's life and death. This would seem self-aggrandizing if the filmmaker didn't quickly move beyond herself and distribute her attention democratically among Shepard's family and friends. In the second half, she widens the film's scope and shows how the news of the crime and trial affected strangers: not just gays and lesbians who saw Shepard's killing as a worst-case-scenario projection of their own experiences with harassment and violence (a teary-eyed Ellen DeGeneres is glimpsed briefly at a public memorial service), but anyone who was offended by displays of ignorant savagery, and frustrated by the tendency of America's legal system and popular culture to make excuses for them. Much of the film is about Shepard coming to terms with his sexual orientation, then getting beyond his cultural roots and building his own identity. His mother Judy remembers how the young Matt Shepard always wanted to dress as Dolly Parton on Halloween\u2014she worries that this is a stereotypical signifier, but still seems moved by the memory\u2014and his father Dennis recounts his own no-big-deal reaction to his son's decision to come out to him. We learn that Shepard traveled the world, and we hear loved ones reading aloud from letters he wrote to them. In an especially affecting passage, we learn that Shepard was raped by several men in an alley in Morocco, an event that influenced his decision to move back home to Wyoming. Advertisement Throughout, \"Matt Shepard Was a Friend of Mine\" does an admirable job of taking a man who's been turned into a symbol and making him a man again\u2014a young man. We get a sense of a life unfolding before us, a personality shifting and changing, a voice finding itself: the middle section of the movie, which focuses on Shepard's personal evolution, is one of the best examples I've seen recently of cinema's ability to universalize a singular experience.\u00a0No matter who you are or where you come from, you'll probably see yourself represented in some part of Shepard's life\u2014which makes that same life's premature extinction all the more saddening, of course. The film also captures that aching void left by a sudden death: that sense that a hole has been torn in reality. The sense of dislocation is felt most keenly in scenes that deal with Shepard's younger brother, Logan, who adored him.\u00a0 Without putting too fine a point on it, the film also asks what it means to be truly Christian, as opposed to distorting Christianity as a cover for hate.\u00a0Concepts of\u00a0acceptance\u00a0(not \"tolerance\") and forgiveness are never far from its mind, and\u00a0these move into the foreground when Josue speaks to\u00a0Father Roger Schmit, who counseled one of Shepard's killers. Schmit tells her that forgiving those who've done wrong to us doesn't mean letting go of anger\u2014that righteous anger at injustice can be a force that gives shape to grief, and turns it into something positive, forward-thinking, healing. \u00a0It's overwhelming in the best way\u2014an observation so simple and profound that stops the film in its tracks. To her credit, Josue lets it stop, and just sits with Schmit's revelations for a while, and lets them sink into the movie, and our minds.\u00a0 The film's title reveals its world view, and its mission: not \"Matt Shepard was,\" but \"Matt Shepard is.\"", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Like Father, Like Son", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Too soon! Comma or not, the English-language title of Japanese writer/director Hirokazu Kore-eda often wrenching new family drama (winner of the Jury Prize at last year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival) bears too distinct a resemblance to the name of 1987\u2019s universally beloved Dudley Moore/Kirk Cameron starter. What\u2019s next, Japan? A movie whose title translates into \"Gone, With The Wind?\" Okay, that\u2019s enough out of me. But in all seriousness, the not inapt but too on-the-nose English language title of \"Soshite chichi ni naru\" (which, Google Translate tells me, works out to something like \"And I Will Be His Father\") is the worst thing about this movie. Kore-eda, whose pictures don\u2019t exactly alternate between soulful, understated fantastic fables (\"Afterlife,\" \"Air Doll\") and quiet family dramas (\"Still Walking\"), brings his trademark delicate but deliberate eye (and ear) to a really heartbreaking scenario. Six years into raising their only child Keita, whose birth left the young mother unable to have any more children, young couple Ryota and Midori are told that the child is not, in fact, theirs at all: that a hospital error switched two baby boys at birth. Soon the couple are meeting their biological child for the first time, along with the family that raised him.  Advertisement As would not be unexpected in a domestic melodrama, the two families could not be more different. While Ryota (Masaharu Fukuyama) is a cold-to-icy ambitious salaryman, next to whom Midori (Machiko Ono) sometimes looks resentfully dutiful, their biological son, named Ryusei, has been growing up with two young siblings, in a cozy raucous household whose tinkerer dad Yudai (Lily Franky) and ramen-restaurant-server mom Yukari (Yoko Maki) dote on their kids despite their limited means.  Initially the clash of classes seems a little schematic. The straightforward Yudai sees a big payoff from the hospital, while Ryota adopts an arguably fake-noble stance with his insistence that the money doesn\u2019t matter, that they have to come up with a plan for what\u2019s best for the kids. Obviously a swap has to be made, eventually. But is that conclusion really so obvious? In a series of beautifully calibrated scenes, Kore-eda explores not just the nature of parental love but of filial love, and as the painful alienated past of Ryota comes to light, his stiffness and lack of empathy become more comprehensible but no less kind of infuriating. It\u2019s a testimony to Fukuyama\u2019s acting skills that as pig-headedly alienating as the character can be, he never becomes a complete turn-off. That\u2019s also a testimony to the way Kore-eda presents the situation; while the perspective is never not clear-headed, the abject heartbreak of the scenario is ever present. (Imagine the way that a typical Hollywood film about this story would make a deliberate burlesque of it.) A second act plot twist of sorts doesn\u2019t just accelerate the dramatic momentum; it forces the characters to confront the uglier sides of themselves. Every now and then, Kore-eda will overplay his representations a little bit; there\u2019s a scene in which Ono\u2019s character contemplates an escape from the torment of potentially trading the son she loves for a child she doesn\u2019t know, biology or not; this takes place on a train, and as her thoughts grow darker, the shadows of the station that the train is pulling into throw her and the child actor into literal darkness. It\u2019s a well-orchestrated effect that hinges on obvious. On the other hand, I suspect the only reason it stands out is because most of the movie is so subtle and straightforward. While I\u2019m not a parent myself, I can see how \"Like Father, Like Son\" would be a tough sit for any parent. Tough, but extremely worthwhile.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Iron Man 3", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Shane Black, who made his bones writing \"Lethal Weapon,\" \"The Last Boy Scout\" and other crash-and-burn action films, was the perfect person to take on \"Iron Man 3,\" and not just because he worked with the franchise's star Robert Downey Jr. on 2005's \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.\" The new film's not great, but it's consistently involving because the tonal shifts are so abrupt. One minute it seems to care a great deal about what's happening, the next it's sneering at the notion that anyone could care about anything that happens in a movie.\u00a0 Advertisement For a franchise on the brink of fatigue, this attitude seems just about right \u2014 especially considering that all of the Iron Man movies are more self-aware comedies than dramas, with overlapping, often improvised-sounding dialogue and winks at the audience which suggest that the filmmakers are fans of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby's affable Road series. This is the kind of film in which the hero can swear revenge against the villain for injuring his friend, then a few scenes later earn big laughs from the sight of Tony Stark in Iron Man regalia tottering down narrow stone steps like a drunk drag queen in nosebleed heels. \"A girl and a couple of lame quips, that's all you got?\" a female assassin taunts Tony. \"Sweetheart,\" he replies, \"that's the title of my autobiography.\" Of course \"Iron Man 3,\" which pits Tony aganst an Osama bin Laden-style terrorist-guru known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), is a lot more brutal than the old Hope-Crosby pictures. In fact, its violence stretches the PG-13 rating to the breaking point, with lethal (if mostly bloodless) gunplay, and moments of wanton cruelty that would be jarring if the film weren't a cartoon fantasy in which pain and the laws of physics are largely theoretical. (As in his other screen appearances, Tony survives high falls and supernatural body-blows that would pulp a real person, but it's all of a piece with the film's dream logic.) The story reunites most of the recurring cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts (CEO of Stark Enterprises, and Tony's girlfriend), Don Cheadle's \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, aka War Machine (re-christened Iron Patriot, and enlisted in the ongoing War on Terror) and Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan, who's still guarding his quipster boss with big brotherly devotion. There are new gadgets, including a segmented \"prehensile\" Iron Man suit whose pieces are controlled via a receptor implanted in Tony's body and fly through the air, locking onto his arms and torso part-by-part. There's a love triangle \u2014 more of a tension triangle \u2014 involving Tony, Pepper and a supposed botanist named Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall). Advertisement And there's a mystery \u2014 or perhaps I should say \"mystery,\" since any sentient moviegoer will be able to guess how all the pieces lock together: Who is the Mandarin? What does he have to do with the dashing, charismatic entrepreneur-scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who wants to sell Stark Industries a metabolizing substance called Extremis, which can create new limbs and heal sick bodies, but has certain, er, side effects? How does Maya fit into all of this? Can the combined forces of the U.S. military and Stark Industries stop the Mandarin from bombing us into oblivion? Barring that, can they at least prevent him from simultaneously interrupting every broadcast in North America with his sermons on the moral failures of military-industrial capitalism? (His sentiments are warmed-over Noam Chomsky, but they're brilliantly edited, with flash-cuts of terrorists training and stuff blowing up. Unlike bin Laden, the Mandarin knows it's not enough to stand in front of a camera and rant; the images need to sizzle, baby!) Tony's adversaries are visually fresh, even though, with two notable exceptions, Black and his cowriter Drew Pearce haven't given them characters to play. They pass as regular people but can morph and re-form like the T-1000 in \"Terminator 2,\" their core substance looks more like molten lava than molten steel and their eyes glow a hellish crimson. During a fight with former Army-colonel-turned-Mandarin-henchman Eric Savin (James Badge Dale, chewing gum a lot) Tony mocks the bald, red-eyed assassin by calling him \"Westworld.\" Downey is as anti-sentimental and hilarious as ever \u2014 he's basically young Bob Hope with biceps -- but from certain angles he looks like a pumped-up Kevin Smith, and I found this distracting and eerie. As his best pal and partner in biomechanical heroics, Cheadle has an easygoing authority and matches Downey quip-for-quip and gunshot-for-gunshot, like last time. He could carry his own comic book picture easily, but if it were as inconsequential as most Marvel projects, I'm not convinced that would be a great use of his talents. Paltrow is tough and endearing when she's onscreen, which isn't often enough.\u00a0 Advertisement As the Osama bin Laden-esque villain the Mandarin, Ben Kingsley steals the movie, and I wish I could say precisely how without spoiling a wonderful surprise. Guy Pearce's torso, showcased shirtless in a fight scene, steals the movie right back. He must have spent six hours a day at the gym for months to look that ripped; you could grate lettuce on his abs. The compositions and editing are industry-standard, mostly loose and chaotic, and if you see the movie in 3D (actually post-converted 3D), you might have trouble telling exactly what's going on during the darker scenes, because the glasses dim the image so much.\u00a0 A couple of days after seeing the film, I can't recall a single beautiful or even memorable shot, though there's a skydiving action sequence two-thirds of the way through that's one of the greatest airborne setpieces in movie history. Given the amiable glop that surrounds it, I can't imagine how it found its way into the movie, though; most of the action isn't so much directed as covered, and its themes are articulated with about as much care. \"Iron Man 3\" builds on the first film's political cynicism by suggesting that politicians and arms dealers dream up foreign policy crises to consolidate power and make money, but it doesn't develop this notion in detail, because if it did, the audience would tune out. As in most comic book blockbusters, both the heroism and villainy are personal, good apples vs. bad apples, and the story's latent pacifism is eclipsed by the joy that Black takes in blowing things up and gunning people down. Hollywood alpha-male sleaze was an undercurrent in the first two films, manifesting itself through hot cars, glittering parties, and strip-club style booty shaking; \"Iron Man 3\" puts those same tendencies in the spotlight. Black's grinning machismo is a bro steroid, making creative muscles that were already well-defined balloon to grotesque proportions. This movie is the \"Entourage\" fantasy of Iron Man. Whenever a character barges into another character's bedroom, you're faintly surprised when there are only two people in the bed. One major character has a serious drug habit and the bad guys' relationship with Extremis has overtones of addiction as well.\u00a0 Advertisement Tony and Rhodey dominate the action and own the story; Pepper spends long stretches of the picture pinned inside what looks like a defective Nautilus machine, but at least she gets to banter with Tony first. Maya doesn't get to do much besides express remorse over her, um, connection to the mayhem, though she does have an unexpectedly touching conversation with Pepper that's filled with regret over bad roads she's taken. When Tony Stark's cliffside home is destroyed in a chopper attack \u2014 a moment prominently showcased in trailers \u2014 the audience gasps as if the film had shown a maniac slashing the Mona Lisa, and within this film's value framework, it does seem an obscenity. It's the greatest swinging bachelor pad ever put on film. \u00a0At long last, Mandarin, have you no decency? From his breakthrough as a screenwriter in \"Lethal Weapon\" to his directorial debut with 2005's \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,\" Black has carved out a niche as a borderline parodist of crash-and-burn action, serving up moldy macho clich\u00e9s while making fun of himself (and the audience) for loving them so much. The prototypical Shane Black hero shambles around presenting himself as a soul-dead cynic who's tired of the same old same old, but within an hour or so, he's rescuing people, swearing vengeance against evildoers, and sailing through the air unloading handguns. His stories straddle the midpoint of of the kidding/not kidding scale like a little kid standing atop a seesaw on the playground, shifting his weight around to make the opposing ends rise or fall.\u00a0 Along the way, Black sprinkles self-aware jokes about the rules and traditions of the genre as if he's Bertolt Brecht's meathead kid brother. Even his screenplays treat commercial screenwriting conventions as a big shared joke. \"Remember Jimmy's friend Henry, who we met briefly at the opening of the film?\" Black asks in the script for 1991's \"The Last Boy Scout.\" \"Of course you do, you're a highly paid script reader or development person.\" There's a brief subplot teaming Tony with a fatherless child that you half-expect will mutate into Daddy Issues sentimentality, but it doesn't, because Tony doesn't roll like that. Downey narrates the beginning and end of the picture. I wish Black had gone all-out and had him narrate the entire thing, a la \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,\" with asides into the camera: \"Hey, you know what I'm gonna invent next? A Hulk signal. The next film'll be 20 minutes long.\" Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}

The pacing isn\u2019t just clunky, it\u2019s edited in a way that almost feels designed to be distracting. The performances are uniformly bad, even from actors who normally do good work. It\u2019s one of those movies that's so inept on every level you almost want to recommend it. If you operate under the belief that you can learn as much, maybe even more, from bad movies as you can from good ones, this one is a master class in what not to do. Advertisement Perhaps the pain of \u201cAbattoir\u201d is magnified by the decent concept that is buried by the incompetent filmmaking. Jessica Lowndes plays Julia Talben, a real estate reporter whose family is brutally murdered by a sociopath. When she returns to the crime scene after the funeral with her cop friend Declan (Joe Anderson), she finds the room in which her loved ones were slaughtered has literally been ripped from the rest of the home. The two investigate further and the quest takes them into Julia\u2019s past, including the town in which she was born, where, shall we say, things aren\u2019t exactly normal. And a mysterious figure named Jebediah Crone (Dayton Callie) is building a home made entirely of rooms in which horror has ensued. If one unexpected death in a home creates a haunting, imagine what dozens would do. \u201cAbattoir\u201d is one of those films that\u2019s 90% exposition, which shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise coming from the man who directed three lesser \u201cSaw\u201d sequels, but it\u2019s still so depressing to watch a movie that needs character and atmosphere but offers only plot. Julia and Declan have to investigate the murder, then the room disappearance, then her past, then Jebediah, and so on and so on. It\u2019s little more than a series of exchanges about what they have just discovered, culminating in a sequence designed to be terrifying but is really more comforting because you know the movie is almost over. We\u2019ve reached the point in a review where one could go on and on about the inadequacies of this film, including its jarring tonal shifts, clich\u00e9d dialogue, etc. But perhaps it\u2019s easier to keep it short but bitter and leave it at this: perhaps it\u2019s untrue that something can be learned from every movie, even the bad ones. Perhaps some movies are so bad they only teach us that life is too short to waste on them.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Miracle Season", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "One of the most immediately noteworthy things about this movie is how clean everybody and everything in it is. \u201cThe Miracle Season\u201d opens with voiceover from Kelly (Erin Moriarty), telling the audience about how amazing it is to find a friend who makes you believe you can fly. Kelly and said friend, Caroline (Danika Yarosh) are seen as little girls and then teens, goofing around in a slightly converted barn that has nary a dust mote floating in it. Soon we\u2019re tooling around with teens Kelly and \u201cLine\u201d (that\u2019s Caroline\u2019s nickname) in a spotless sea-blue convertible; the girls are dressed in immaculate jerseys and shorts; they park outside a bakery and even the early autumn leaves on the sidewalk look as if they\u2019ve been freshly rinsed and meticulously placed. Stars Hollow looks like a neighborhood from a particularly grungy \u201cLaw and Order: SVU\u201d episode by comparison. And West High School, where the girls play volleyball, makes the high school in \u201cLove, Simon\u201d look like the one from \u201cThe Blackboard Jungle.\u201d Advertisement Caroline and Kelly themselves are similarly well-scrubbed. Line is very lively but wholesome; her mischievous streak is never malicious but aims to push her friends to do things they might never have tried. As when she pushed Kelly to invite a handsome new neighbor to the season kickoff party at the dust-free barn Line\u2019s dad owns, or when she impulsively challenges her teammates to partake in a pizza-eating contest, which move doesn\u2019t sit well with her no-nonsense volleyball coach, Kathy Bresnahan, played by Helen Hunt. Coach Bresnahan is particularly irked because her team was the state champion of 2010, and \u201cBres,\u201d as her charges call her, doesn\u2019t want that to be a fluke.    The reason the movie\u2019s set in 2010 is because it\u2019s based on a true story, and the true story gets rolling with a tragedy: Caroline\u2019s death in a driving accident just as the season\u2019s getting underway. The movie\u2019s particular cushy sheen, engineered by director Sean McNamara, means that of course the accident is not depicted. But Caroline\u2019s character has been well enough embodied by Yarosh\u2019s performance that the loss registers, and the devastation of her teammates, not to mention her surgeon father, played by William Hurt, is felt.    To a certain extent. Given the title, you know that this movie is not selling suspense but inspiration. The dispirited team can\u2019t shake off the loss at first, but thanks to an example reluctantly set by Kelly, it starts to find its footing again. The determination to win \u201cfor Line\u201d pushes everyone, until the coach asks the near-impossible: that the team clear the board and get to the quarter-finals by taking fourteen games in a row.    I imagine it\u2019s hard to simulate volleyball games, and I don\u2019t have to imagine in order to remark that they are difficult to make exciting on film. So this movie goes for the heartstrings and tear ducts more than the sports-conscious. The results are pretty mixed. God bless William Hurt. The script gives him every excuse to phone in the part of Caroline\u2019s father by obliging him to speak lines like \u201cI may be the surgeon, but you\u2019re the hero out there.\u201d Despite that, he\u2019s straight and genuine throughout. As is Hunt, whose character\u2019s emotionally shut-down fa\u00e7ade gives way in a powerful scene near the end.    Problem is, every time the movie gets near an authentic emotion, it barely pauses before making a run to the next Katy Perry song cue. (Seriously, both \u201cRoar\u201d and \u201cFirework\u201d are featured herein.) Given the care that the adult and teen actors invested in trying to honor their real-life counterparts, this feels lazy. If you like Katy Perry songs that much, you may feel differently.\u00a0  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Literally, Right Before Aaron", "Stars": 0.0, "Review": "Justin Long plays a fellow named Adam in \u201cLiterally, Right Before Aaron,\u201d a movie whose title allusion is explained about 30 minutes in. Aaron is the man marrying Adam\u2019s lovely ex-girlfriend Allison, played by Cobie Smulders, and Adam dated her literally right before. This is something of an issue for Adam. The movie opens with Adam getting the invitation to the wedding, by phone. Right away we can tell his relationship with Allison was special, because he has brief flashbacks of her face, and the shots all have lens flares in them, and they all look like low-rent ripoffs of similar frames from the Spike Jonze movie \u201cHer,\u201d specifically the parts where Joaquin Phoenix is getting all moony remembering Rooney Mara. So the wedding invite sets him askew. He goes out with work pals Mark (John Cho) and Claire (Charlyne Yi)\u2014did I mention that Adam works in the movie business, or its periphery, editing a nature show for a pompous fake zoologist played by Peter Gallagher?\u2014and he mopes throughout. \u201cDude. Just bowl. You\u2019re being a douche,\u201d Charlotte tells him. And honestly, writer/director/editor/composer Ryan Eggold, best known for acting on the television show \u201cThe Blacklist,\u201d could have ended the movie right there, because what we\u2019ve got for the next 30\u00a0minutes is, well, Adam being a douche.    Advertisement Adam then proposes impulsively to a glossy high-profile girlfriend, whose particular glossiness definitively tags her as Not The One. As she\u2019s about to accept, he blurts, \u201cI think we should break up.\u201d She exclaims, with absolute justification, \u201cYou are an a**hole. An A**HOLE.\u201d Storming out of the restaurant, she adds, \u201cYou are going to die alone.\u201d Again, this would have made a good ending to the movie. But no. Instead we get an hour-and-a-half of Adam brooding and reminiscing on his shared past with Allison, including their ostensible \u201cmeet-cute.\u201d This is really good. He approaches her in the college library while she\u2019s sitting among the stacks reading Of Mice and Men. He says to her, \u201cDo you want to get a coffee, or a juice, or a soda ...\u00a0\u201d She replies, \u201cI\u2019m reading my book.\u201d    And he tells her the book\u2019s ending. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re charming or just an a**hole,\u201d she says. I don\u2019t know about you, lady, but I had a pretty good idea during the bowling scene.    Of course, maybe Allison isn\u2019t so delightful either. There\u2019s one restaurant scene flashback that\u2019s meant to evoke \u201cAnnie Hall.\u201d Now, only the intent is evident; the evocation itself doesn\u2019t really take. The couple is trying to out-gross-out each other by concocting imaginary crimes against their fellow restaurant patrons. The scenario Allison proposes ends, \u201cand he dies \u2026 alone \u2026 of AIDS.\u201d Cute.\u00a0    Back in the present tense, Adam heads to San Francisco to attend the wedding. He accepts an invitation from groom Aaron to play tennis, even though he is incapable of playing tennis. He gets drunk at the wedding and dances like a jerk; he tells a nine-year-old boy to \u201ccall me when you\u2019ve got some hair on your balls\u201d; he does some indirect looks-shaming of a character played by Kristen Schaal, and much, much more.    It\u2019s painful to watch. Not because no one cares about Adam\u2019s heartache. But because the movie is boring, trite, sexist tripe that wants to make the viewer empathize with a guy who\u2019s actually pretty aggressive in his pursuit of loserdom. The only achievement Adam seems to have ever racked up in life was in dating Allison, who looks like Cobie Smulders and makes AIDS jokes. And Adam managed to screw that up, and I should care \u2026 why? Because Justin Long has a pleasant face? IT\u2019S NOT PLEASANT ENOUGH. Near the end of the movie, Adam defends himself. \u201cAmbush? This isn\u2019t an ambush,\u201d he says to Allison after accosting her in the ladies room at the wedding. Saying this, he\u2019s poking his finger at her in a way that comes close to actual assault. If one of those digits actually lands on her clavicle, it\u2019s going to leave a bruise.\u00a0 Advertisement There\u2019s a phrase circulating in contemporary cultural discourse: \u201cmediocre white men.\u201d As a white man who grapples a lot with insecurity and other roiling ups and downs of self-worth even at an advanced age, it\u2019s a group of words that sometimes makes me tetchy. Having watched \u201cLiterally, Right Before Aaron,\u201d though, I have a new understanding and appreciation for the term.

{"Title": "Counting", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In his masterful \u201cMuseum Hours,\u201d filmmaker Jem Cohen merged his skills as an urban documentarian with a narrative about two unlikely\r\nfriends. Art, history, companionship, support and everyday life merged into one\r\nvision. His latest, \u201cCounting,\u201d billed as a \u201cA film in 15 Chapters,\u201d is both\r\nmore ambitious and less purposeful in its intent. Clearly designed as a nod to\r\nChris Marker (particularly \u201cSans Soleil\u201d), \u201cCounting\u201d captures life around the\r\nworld in all its simplicity and diversity, as Cohen bounces back and forth from\r\nNew York City to Russia to Turkey, and locales in between. There\u2019s little\r\nnarration, little noise at all outside of the hum of traffic or the whine of a\r\ntrain or the rustle of leaves. Most people in frame are seen from behind, or\r\nvia reflection, or from a distance. And there are cats. Everywhere. Cohen isn\u2019t\r\nas interested in faces as he is urban tableaus. The result is a challenging\r\nwork that can be both exhilarating and grueling in its deliberate pace. Cohen\r\nis an undeniably gifted filmmaker, even if the sum total of this piece isn\u2019t\r\nquite as interesting as its parts. Advertisement \u201cCounting\u201d opens in New York City, featuring footage that\r\nthe filmmaker captured around the city from 2012 to 2014. The first segment of \u201cCounting,\u201d\r\nwhich I believe is also its longest, is arguably its best as it\u2019s a fantastic\r\ndisplay of Cohen\u2019s skills. He can turn the mundane imagery of urban existence\r\ninto art by the way it\u2019s shot, scored, or juxtaposed with another image. What\r\ncaptures his eye and the way he weaves into a piece can often result in great\r\nart. In the first segment, we hear a speech about discovering the secrets of\r\nthe universe while we view a sedentary homeless person. We see a torn page with\r\na headline about \u201cThe World\u2019s Last Mysteries.\u201d Cohen is placing imagery and\r\naudio of the questions of the universe against reflections of travelers on a\r\ntrain or a homeless man crossing the street. This is daily life and the world\u2019s\r\ngreatest mysteries are contained within it. Cohen has a remarkable ability to go from placid, almost\r\nsoothing imagery to kinetic, more frantic footage like when he captures an \u201cI\r\nCan\u2019t Breathe\u201d protest scored to discordant, loud music. Even flags waving in\r\nthe wind at a car dealership look antagonistic. He\u2019s playing with the essence\r\nof filmmaking here, knowing that the images just before and after those flags,\r\nalong with the choice of audio, change the way the viewer responds to them.  Sometimes Cohen can be straightforward and even didactic,\r\nsuch as in chapter 7, in which he presents imagery of reflections of people on\r\ntheir phones accompanied by audio of testimony about the NSA wiretapping.\r\nAlthough even this \u201cshort film within the big film\u201d feels contextually resonant\r\nwithin a piece that feels, at least to me, about interconnectivity and\r\ncommonality. Cohen jumps around the world and finds numerous images that look\r\nlike reflections of each other. People crossing squares in New York City and\r\nSt. Petersburg become often indistinguishable. Some of his compositions are\r\npicture-postcard beautiful while others take a minute to even discern what it\r\nis being displayed. And he\u2019s obsessed with travel and motion. A voice sings in\r\none chapter, \u201cDo you ever wonder where it\r\nis you\u2019re wandering?\u201d We\u2019re all wanderers around this world that\u2019s more\r\nsimilar than we even know. There are times, many times actually, when \u201cCounting\u201d feels\r\na bit too self-indulgent, something that never struck me during \u201cMuseum Hours,\u201d\r\nan undeniably more accessible piece for the average filmgoer. It starts to get\r\na bit exhausting and unfocused. Unpacking \u201cCounting\u201d can be difficult, and it\r\nfeels at times like it\u2019s purposefully so, as if Cohen is challenging\r\ntraditional expectations of film analysis, even ones as often abstract as his.\r\nBut one cannot deny the ambition of \u201cCounting,\u201d a movie that travels the world,\r\nconnecting it through the commonality of both everyday behavior and the\r\nuniversal language of cinema. \u201cCounting\u201d ends almost peacefully, with images of calm and\r\nnight. I was hoping for a bit more cumulative power, something to tie these\r\nchapters together, but I think Cohen purposefully avoids those kind of easy\r\ncinematic answers. Maybe these are just images, people and places around the\r\nworld that he found interesting. Perhaps you will too. And sometimes life is as\r\nsimple as that. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "10 Cloverfield Lane", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Warning: As you may have guessed by its stealth production\r\n(no one really knew it existed before a trailer dropped), the less you know\r\nabout Dan Trachtenberg\u2019s \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d the better. It is a film that\r\nplays on forced perspective, keeping you in the dark about what exactly is\r\ngoing on. I will tread very lightly in the review to follow, but I won\u2019t be\r\nhurt if you want to click away right about now. Come back after you've seen it. \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d is a tight, tense thriller carried by\r\nexcellent performances from John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. It has\r\nechoes of Alfred Hitchcock and H.G. Wells embedded in a cat-and-mouse game\r\nafter the end of the world. Without directly acknowledging it in traditional\r\nblockbuster ways, it\u2019s a sequel to 2008\u2019s \u201cCloverfield,\u201d a found footage film\r\nabout an alien invasion. It\u2019s almost like a spin-off from that film, imagining\r\na different story taking place in a different part of the world but in the same\r\nuniverse. Whereas that movie jumped on a current trend in its approach (found\r\nfootage), Dan Trachtenberg\u2019s film feels much more old-fashioned in its style,\r\nrecalling genre pictures of the \u201850s and \u201860s. Trachtenberg and his team don\u2019t\r\nexplore some of the film\u2019s potential themes as deeply as I hoped they would and\r\nit\u2019s less visually engaging than it could have been. But this is rock-solid\r\nentertainment, a film meant to keep you guessing and jumping for 100 minutes\r\nbefore it throws you back into the world to argue about its ending. Advertisement Once in development under the name \u201cThe Cellar,\u201d the script\r\nby Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken (with a co-story credit by \u201cWhiplash\u201d\r\nwriter Damien Chazelle) was retrofitted to place it in the world of \u201cCloverfield.\u201d\r\nSo, as Michelle (Winstead) drives away from her life and partner, leaving her\r\nhouse keys and ring on the table, we hear ominous reports of power outages on\r\nthe coast over the radio. These opening scenes are clearly designed to be\r\nreminiscent of another story of a woman who left the city for a dangerous\r\ncountryside, as Michelle packing her bags and Bear McCreary\u2019s overheated,\r\nHermann-esque score will make anyone who\u2019s seen \"Psycho\" think of Marion Crane in the\r\nopening act of Hitchcock's classic. It\u2019s not long before Michelle finds her Norman Bates. After a terrifying car accident, Michelle wakes up in a\r\nbarren room, chained to the wall. She soon meets her captor, an imposing figure\r\nnamed Howard (John Goodman), although he claims to be more of a savior than a\r\nkidnapper. He saw Michelle\u2019s accident just as the sky exploded. There\u2019s been an\r\n\u201cevent\u201d outside, and he grabbed Michelle just in time to get her into the\r\nbunker he built for just such an occasion. It could be the Russians, the North\r\nKoreans or the Martians\u2014but, whatever it is, the air probably won\u2019t be\r\nbreathable for one or two years. And isn\u2019t Michelle lucky that they have enough\r\nfood, filtered air, and other supplies in this doomsday prepper\u2019s bunker to\r\nwait it out? They\u2019re not alone. Just before Howard closed the door, a\r\nneighbor named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) barged his way in as well. Emmett,\r\nwho has seen Howard building this bunker for just such an occasion, confirms\r\nenough of what Howard says that Michelle starts to believe. Well-played by the \"Short Term 12\" star, Emmett becomes a pivot point for the film, alternating between encouraging Michelle's fears and affirming that Howard is, at least in part, who he says he is. And when she sees\r\nsomething horrible after an aborted escape attempt, she resigns herself to the\r\nidea that these two men will be the last human beings she ever sees. But\r\nsomething\u2019s not right with Howard. He\u2019s controlling to an uncomfortable level,\r\nespecially when it comes to the dynamic between Michelle and Emmett. There\u2019s a\r\nfantastic scene of game-playing in which Howard\u2019s misogyny is laid on the\r\ntable, and the film keeps us guessing as to just what his intentions or end\r\ngame will be.  Advertisement That sense of unease is certainly there in the script and\r\nTrachtenberg deserves credit as well, but it\u2019s John Goodman\u2019s performance that makes\r\nyour skin crawl. He captures a man on the edge of sanity for whom control is\r\nkey. He\u2019s not an obvious maniac, as some other actors would have played the\r\nrole, but someone who honestly thinks he\u2019s a savior, and thinking that plays\r\ninto his control-freak God complex. Goodman keeps us guessing, allowing\r\nglimpses of the possibly kind man that Howard used to be before all of this\r\nhappened but even shading those in a sense of conditionality. Howard reminds\r\nMichelle and Emmett that he saved them so much that we start to wonder what he\u2019s\r\ngoing to expect in return. In terms of performance, the underrated Winstead matches\r\nGoodman in every way. So fantastic in \u201cSmashed\u201d and \u201cFaults,\u201d this is an\r\nactress who only gets a small portion of the attention she deserves. She\r\ncarries \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d conveying Michelle\u2019s conflicted feelings about\r\nher predicament and staying so completely in the moment that the tension\r\nremains. We only know what she knows, so she has to be our conduit to the film,\r\nresponding to each new hurdle and conflict as we would.  The final half-hour of \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d is pretty much\r\ngoing to dominate the conversation around the film. Without spoiling anything,\r\nit\u2019s a series of events in which Michelle finds new challenges around every\r\ncorner (that would only be a spoiler if you\u2019ve never seen a thriller). While I\u2019m\r\nnot sure it\u2019s as narratively sound as it could have been\u2014and one can see the\r\nretrofitting of the traditional thriller into the sci-fi universe\u2014Winstead and\r\nthe filmmakers keep it working through sheer confidence. Like the opening\r\nscenes of the film, the final act is largely dialogue-free. There\u2019s none of\r\nthat character-talking-to-herself nonsense you see in lesser films that aren\u2019t\r\nas sure of themselves when it comes to visual storytelling. So many movies hold\r\nyour hand as you go over every hill on the rollercoaster.

If you\u2019re familiar with the work of Tony Jaa, and have followed his career trajectory, you may think you know the reason I\u2019m asking the above question. For those needing to get up to speed: Tony Jaa is a pretty incredible Thai martial arts dude. Not much of an actor, but certainly enough of an incredible Thai martial arts dude to conceive and perform in a series of staggering action sequences in latter-day martial arts classics such as \"Ong Bak: Muy Thai Warrior\" and its two sequels. He is also known for eschewing what the martial arts movie pros call \"wire work\" (no flying kicks for him) and reliance on CGI. A good old fashioned organic incredible martial arts dude, in other words.  Advertisement So Jaa fans may think I\u2019m asking why he\u2019s doing wire work and putting himself in the same frame with CGI effects in his new U.S. release \"The Protector 2,\" but that\u2019s not it. I\u2019m upset because he\u2019s doing such cheesy wire work, and because the CGI effects he\u2019s interacting with are so lame. I\u2019m upset because he\u2019s appearing in a movie that unnecessarily tricks up the admittedly no-big-thing but still amiable character dynamic of the 2005 \"The Protector\" (Thai country boy makes odd couple with cranky cop) by introducing a villain played by RZA, arguably a hip-hop genius but still The Worst Actor In The World (a title he clinched with 2012\u2019s \"The Man With The Iron Fists\"). I\u2019m upset because all of the bad acting and bad plotting actually ameliorate the impact of the action scenes. Think about how bad the acting and plotting have to be in order to distill the impact of a Tony Jaa battle scene. If you know a little about Tony Jaa, that\u2019s kind of hard to imagine. I know. But trust me. Or don\u2019t. The fact is this: if you\u2019re already a Tony Jaa fan, you\u2019re going to see \"The Protector 2\" anyway.

I blame RZA.\" If you\u2019re not a Tony Jaa fan, you should start with \"Ong Bak,\" then see everything else.

{"Title": "A Farewell to Fools", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "There's a moment in \"A Farewell to Fools\" that shimmers with possible greatness, a moment that is, sadly, far too brief. Gerard Depardieu plays Ipu, a Frenchman taken in by a kindly village in Romania following WWI, and he is a lumbering child-like giant who spends his days chopping wood and going fishing with a young boy who loves him. During one scene where he is invited to a fancy dinner, he says to one of the other guests present, \"How did I look when I was young?\" We bring our associations to everything we see in the cinema, and in that moment, our long associations with Depardieu, the international movie star, all of his great roles, come into play. He says the line with a wistfulness that threatens to overwhelm the film. For the most part, \"A Farewell to Fools\" rollicks along on its own bizarre and not successful path, comedic moments falling flat, emotional moments running shallow, but in that moment we can feel something else striving to break free.  Advertisement Much like Fellini's \"Amarcord\", \"A Farewell to Fools\" is a farcical coming-of-age story taking place under the shadow of a military occupation. Romania is overrun by Nazis, and while the Germans are universally hated, everyone races around in a manic state trying to please them. A German soldier had his throat cut in the fields outside of town, and the Nazi overlords tell the frightened populace of the village that unless someone comes forward to claim responsibility, ten of the village's leading citizens will be executed the following day. Harvey Keitel plays Father Johanis, the local priest who gathers together the ten leading citizens (the mayor, the notary, the sheriff) and these reprehensible folks cook up a plan to make Ipu confess to the murder, to sacrifice himself for the good of the town.  Ipu is a Quasimodo-type character, who lives in a garret, listening to a scratchy recording of \"The Marseilleise\" and dreaming of his glory days as a French soldier. Ipu is unaware that he is being set up as the fall guy. He trusts the people who have taken him in, failing to recognize cruelty when it is right in front of him. He is swayed by Father Johanis' descriptions of the hero's funeral he will be given and the huge gravestone with gold-plated letters they will place in the cemetery for him. Alex (Bogdan Iancu), the young boy who is Ipu's only friend, sees what is happening and can't stop it. Ipu, as played by Depardieu, staggers around in a filthy white shirt, playing war games with his young friend, haunted by fragmented memories of his own wartime experiences, and easily overwhelmed by smooth talkers like Father Johanis.  Directed by Bogdan Dreyer, and based on a novel by Romanian \r\nscreenwriter and author Titus Popovici, \"A Farewell to Fools\" wants to be a farce. It should be a farce. But farce is \r\ndifficult in any circumstance, and while \"A Farewell to Fools\" sometimes hits the right tone, it can't sustain it. In one wacky sequence, the only successful one in the film, Ipu, convinced to go along with Father Johanis' plan, asks that they do a rehearsal of his grand funeral, so that he can at least see what it will be like. The mock funeral, involving the whole town, is very funny, involving villagers stealing flags in the dead of night, under the noses of the Nazis, to wrap the body (\"No, not the swastika flag!\" hisses the mayor. \"The other flag!\"), Ipu sitting up in his coffin to listen to Father Johanis' sermon, and a procession to the cemetery with a marching band playing a happy tune. A sequence like that tells you to not take things too seriously, to laugh at these people, to laugh at the self-serious importance of charlatans like Father Johanis. Evil stalks the village, but it's more ridiculous than anything else. Advertisement  The film was shot in Romania, and Depardieu and Keitel are surrounded by a cast of Romanian actors. Keitel seems stiff and unsure of what film he is actually in, and the rest of the ensemble play their roles broadly, appropriate for farce but lost in the uneven tone of the whole. Romania's new wave is flourishing right now, with directors and producers and actors bringing forth dark, ironic, disturbing films detailing the chaos and problems inherent in the post-Ceau\u0219escu era. \"A Farewell to Fools\" is a strangely flat entry in that roll call, with that one gleaming wistful moment from Depardieu suggesting the film it could have been.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Bushwick", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "This movie will lose the goodwill of any longtime New Yorker watching it within the first ten minutes. Under the opening credits, there are a series of relatively pleasant helicopter views of Brooklyn, starting from the shores of Coney Island. But these grow more sinister as we note the presence of a machine-gun barrel in the bottom of the frame. Yikes. Then: cut to an underground subway station. Church Avenue, service by the G and F lines, as the visible signage shows. Lucy, played by Brittany Snow, is wending her way to the exit, with her milquetoast boyfriend, played by Some Dude\u2122. They\u2019re mildly concerned because there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone around but otherwise are feeling jokey about milquetoast boyfriend\u2019s impending introduction to Lucy\u2019s grandmother. Their reverie is interrupted by a screaming man, his body entirely on fire, running down from the subway\u2019s street level stairs.  Advertisement (Side note: I know that screaming-man-on-fire is a favorite shock effect of hack filmmakers the world over, but \u201cstop drop and roll\u201d is a real-life thing, unlike \u201cshooting zombies in the head is the only way to kill them,\u201d which is only a movie thing. Stop, drop and roll works. I once set my entire forearm on fire in a lighter fluid mishap, and I stopped, dropped and rolled instinctually, and it worked! Why don\u2019t more movie characters try this?) Now sensible people might react to this sight by going back down to the track level and getting the next train to somewhere else, but Lucy and milquetoast boyfriend have to check out the situation, because apparently Grandma is hung up on punctuality. No sooner does milquetoast boyfriend get to the sidewalk than he too is incinerated. Lucy, whose grandmother must be really very strict, goes to the sidewalk anyway, to see an overturned flaming Mr. Softee truck, and varied parties shooting and blowing stuff up.  So she runs, and is pursued into a basement by two street menaces. One is white, or white-ish, while the other is black. For balance. Although the black one ends up being the more sexual-assault-menacing one. Interrupting this unsavory bit of race-baiting is Dave Bautista, an ex-Marine named \u201cStupe,\u201d who owns the basement in which the rape is considered. He dispatches the villains briskly, but he\u2019s not particularly friendly to Lucy, at least not at first.  As for the thing that will have New Yorkers checking out: When Lucy comes out of the subway station, she is indeed in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn; she runs past Jefferson Avenue\u2019s fabled Owl Juice Pub and other landmarks. Only problem is that the Church Avenue station from which she supposedly emerges isn\u2019t anywhere near Bushwick. Lucy later tells Stupe that she came in on the L train; as seen on the signage at the beginning of the movie, the Church Street station services the G and F. What\u2019s the big deal? Ask Martin Scorsese. He has recounted in several interviews how nuts it used to drive him, in old Hollywood movies, to see a couple turn a corner in Greenwich Village and wind up strolling down the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. But there\u2019s a deeper problem at work. Nick Damici and Graham Reznick, the screenwriters, seem to have based their portrayal of this transforming neighborhood in the county of Kings entirely on viewings of that old sensationalist TV cop drama \u201cBrooklyn South,\u201d which worried parents used to cite to their children when they wanted to dissuade them from moving to the borough.  Advertisement Additionally, they seem to have written their dialogue by typing out \u201cWe gotta get the f**k out of here!\u201d into their Final Draft document, copying that, and then pasting it onto each page, two or three times. For some reason they have crafted an inadvertently hilarious exchange between its two main characters: \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cHoboken.\u201d  Lucy is an entitled, petulant dolt whose most interesting trait is that she doesn\u2019t go into shock despite conditions that would put her there multiple times. Stupe is a stock Bautista type: taciturn, grunty, all that. He\u2019s an ex-Marine who\u2019s supposed to have Rambo-esque skills (and of course somebody makes a point of mentioning the Stallone character, for \u201cverisimilitude,\u201d I guess), but when he deigns to teach Lucy how to use a gun, he never shows her where the safety is.  The movie\u2019s main feature is a group of long-take, moving-camera action scenes that I guess might have been more engaging had the characters on the run and in battle been figures you wanted to spend any time with. They\u2019re not. These set pieces are either getting much easier to do, or they are the sole talent of co-directors Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott, because the filmmakers distinguish themselves in precisely zero other ways. The obnoxious, opportunistic premise is a menace-from-within scenario that\u2019s laughable even in the wake of certain current events. The numbskull faux nihilism of the ending is possibly intended as a homage to a recently departed horror movie director, but it\u2019s more like a callow insult.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Affluenza", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "In 2014, teenage Ethan Crouch was given probation and mandatory treatment in a rehab facility for driving drunk and killing four people. He was given no jail time. The case made national news when a psychologist hired by the defense said that Crouch suffered from something called \"Affluenza,\" where poor little rich kids just have to run wild because their parents haven't set any limits. While the judge said that the \"Affluenza Defense\" carried no weight in her decision, there was a lot of worried commentary about the precedent such a defense might set, similar to the notorious \"Twinkie defense.\" That actually could make a semi-interesting story for a film. Unfortunately, Kevin Asch's second film, \"Affluenza,\" is not that story. A lukewarm attempt to portray the so-called affliction, set against the backdrop of the 2008 economic crash and President Obama's election, \"Affluenza\" thinks it is deep when it is merely trite. It illuminates nothing. Advertisement The situation is made more problematic by the clear nod to \"The Great Gatsby\" in its story particulars. \"Affluenza\" suffers constantly in comparison. Fisher Miller (Ben Rosenfield) takes the Nick Carraway role as a teenager from Ithaca, spending the summer with his rich stockbroker uncle Phil (Steve Guttenberg) on Great Neck, Long Island. Fisher, who is a photographer trying to get into art school, enters a world of lackadaisical teenage corruption and boredom, but he finds easy entry into that world by dealing drugs. Phil is married to Bunny (Samantha Mathis), and they have a teenage daughter, Kate (Nicola Peltz). Kate spends most of her days either sunning by the pool or shopping. Women in this world are beautiful useless baubles, supported by the money their men make on Wall Street. Fisher befriends a rich kid named Dylan (Gregg Sulkin), the Jay Gatsby stand-in, who lolls about like James Spader in \"Pretty in Pink,\" in tennis whites &\u00a0sunglasses, and is neglected by his rich father. Dylan has fallen madly in love with Kate and begs Fisher's help to \"win her heart\", and then, in a completely unconvincing scene, he stands underneath Kate's window calling her name in agony, a la Stanley Kowalski. These people don't make any sense. Perhaps that is supposed to be the point, but Antonio Macia's screenplay is unable to get beneath the surface of these people and\u00a0their circumstances. It's simplistic and condescending. People stand around and state who they are, clearly. The first time we meet Uncle Phil, he says to his nephew: \"Art school - la la la, you should go to business school.\" One hot-shot guy on the golf course happens to be overheard saying, \"Let's cruise the town in my new Aston Martin and check out the tail.\" Fisher is supposed to be the naive interloper in a sophisticated world about to collapse. Everyone sits around watching Obama's campaign speeches on television with a visible lack of interest. Even the news of the national financial situation doesn't seem to register until it's too late. Only in the performance of Steve Guttenberg do we get a sense of the real stakes for these people. There is a terrific confrontation scene near the end of the film between Guttenberg and Mathis, that is vicious, violent, and undercut by sheer terror that their privileged existence has been destroyed in one fell swoop. That scene is so good, and it's the only one. The young cast seems pretty lost, unaware of the deeper implications of the story, and unable to fulfill the obligations in the script with any sense of coherency. Dylan could be a fascinating character, a broken and shallow kid, who has never had to work on getting a personality, or creating anything for himself. Instead, he remains an insipid caricature. Advertisement Some of the scenes are filmed from a slight distance, important scenes, and the distance ends up muting the urgency of whatever might have been happening. The energy that may exist between the actors is lost in that intervening space. Fisher is, supposedly, from a more modest background, and yet the entitlement around him has affected him so much that at one point he murmurs, \"I'm gonna have to get a part-time job at some point,\" as though that idea is completely revolutionary. Macia also saddles him with terrible lines such as: \"What's the point of making all that money if you can't connect to the people that you love?\" One yearns for Gatsby's green light across the bay after listening to dialogue like that.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Final Portrait", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The writer James Lord was a chronicler of 20th\u00a0century art who not infrequently befriended the artists he wrote about. In 1964, in Paris, the sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti asked Lord to sit for a portrait. What the artist had originally pitched as a day\u2019s work wound up taking almost three weeks. Not an eternity by any stretch of the imagination, but an inconvenience, and a meaty experience, one out of which Lord forged a memoir entitled \u201cA Giacometti Portrait.\u201d \u201cFinal Portrait\u201d is\u00a0an adaptation of that memoir written and directed by Stanley Tucci. Like a couple of other directorial efforts from Tucci, who\u2019s primarily known as an actor, this is a picture about process. His 1996 \u201cBig Night\u201d is the story of the making of an epic meal; 2000\u2019s \u201cJoe Gould\u2019s Secret\u201d is a dual portrait of two writers with very different approaches to work (and very different results).    Advertisement Giacometti, a self-described \u201cItalian Swiss\u201d now ensconced in a ramshackle mini-compound containing studio and living quarters in Paris, is played with shambolic gruffness by Geoffrey Rush. Armie Hammer\u2019s straight-standing, composed James Lord seems the artist\u2019s polar opposite, but the two have a kinship\u2014Lord has a deep understanding of Giacometti\u2019s artistic language.    Still, the artist\u2019s relentless self-doubt puzzles Lord. Lord protests that Giacometti\u2019s success ought to have erased that. Quite the contrary, the artist observes: \u201cWhat better breeding ground for self-doubt than success?\u201d The trappings of success mean little to him, either. He makes millions of francs in sales, but almost literally throws it away; what he doesn\u2019t, he hides in various nook of his studio.    As Alberto begins, erases, and again begins the portrait, James interrogates not just the artist but his brother and assistant Diego (Tony Shalhoub), his dutiful, very drawn-looking wife Annette (Sylvie Testud). Another presence is Caroline (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy), a local prostitute with whom the artist is highly invested, to the point of buying her a sporty new BMW.    The movie is a minimally lovely treat to look at. Tucci and cinematographer Danny Cohen desaturate the colors at the beginning, giving the movie a black-and-slate-gray look from which blues and reds try to fight their way into the viewer\u2019s perception. The evening scenes, many of them spent at Giacometti\u2019s local, Caf\u00e9 Adrien, have a golden warmth. The mobile camera, which on occasion becomes a trifle too shaky, negotiates the artist\u2019s studio with a crafty curiosity.    This movie is a chamber piece, and even at its modest 90-minute running time, it gets a trifle repetitious\u2014Alberto picks up the brush again, James sits down, the camera produces a series of extreme close-ups of James\u2019 face (it\u2019s the head that the artist has the most trouble with). It\u2019s a nice face, with excellent pores, but, you know. Still, the depictions of artistic struggle and mania, the communication of the artist\u2019s frequently painful bubble, are insightful and rewarding. The warts-and-all depiction of Giacometti, which establishes a credible explanation if not excuse for the many selfish acts he\u2019s seen doing, winds up being an apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.\u00a0  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}

Spunky sweet, and smart Amber (Elizabeth Roberts) runs\r\nout of gas in the middle of a picture-perfect town in which Clay (Swartzwelder)\r\nhones various crafts at an antique store called, yep, \u201cOld Fashioned.\u201d Amber\u2019s\r\nresolve, such as it was, was to drive until she ran out of gas and set up\r\nhousekeeping wherever that happened to be. Clay helps her set up in a new\r\nquaintly furnished apartment but won\u2019t go through the screen door outside. He\r\nhas made a vow, he tells Amber: he won\u2019t be alone in a room with a woman who\r\nisn\u2019t his wife. Amber finds this odd. She finds it odder when she learns he\u2019s\r\nnot married.  Advertisement Clay\u2019s back-story is revealed in dribs and drabs: this is\r\nnot quite \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin\u201d played straight. The hero was not just a\r\ncollegiate ladies\u2019 man but a bit of a Joe Francis type as well, producing\r\nsalacious videos. Then he changed. \u201cYou found Jesus?\u201d Amber asks him. \u201cMore\r\nlike\u2026he found me,\u201d Clay responds. So, yes, this \u201cFifty Shades\u201d-counter-programming isn\u2019t\r\nkidding around about being counter-programming. But I would not necessarily\r\ncharacterize this effort as a \u201cChristian movie,\u201d not that there\u2019s anything\r\nwrong with that. Swartzwelder does a very thorough and not unbalanced job of\r\nportraying Christian characters trying to function in a social milieu that\r\ndiscourages values such as chastity, modesty, and so on. The movie tries hard\r\nnot to be overtly prudish about its point of view, and in many respects it\r\nsucceeds\u2014I didn\u2019t even notice until after it was over that it had no swearing\r\nin its dialogue. Once Clay explains his chaste theory of courtship to Amber,\r\nand Amber agrees to make a go of it, \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d also has no problem owning\r\nup to the fact that Clay\u2019s quest to be \u201ca decent person\u201d is in fact more than a\r\nlittle dogmatic. He\u2019s depicted as defensive and even a little hostile in terms\r\nof the ways he stands up for his beliefs. Amber\u2019s more conventionally\r\n\u201cfree-spirited,\u201d but within that context she\u2019s got more sense than Clay, as\r\ndoes Clay\u2019s adorable wise aunt Zella (Dorothy Silver). Near the climax of the\r\npicture, when Amber and Clay argue about the idea of forgiveness, Clay sniffs\r\n\u201cYou make it sound so easy,\u201d and Amber shoots him down good with \u201cYou make it\r\nsound impossible.\u201d It\u2019s incredibly rare to see an American movie with a\r\nChristian perspective that\u2019s more invested in philosophizing and empathizing\r\nthan in eschatological pandering, and for that alone \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d deserves\r\ncommendation. The movie\u2019s also very well acted and beautifully shot. However, Swartzwelder does tend to lay things on a little\r\nthick. There\u2019s a scene in which a character gets a poster for the Frank Capra\r\nfilm \u201cMeet John Doe\u201d as a present, which is all well and good, but then the\r\nviewer is subjected to a reprise of Gary Cooper\u2019s climactic speech at the end\r\nof the film along with a few sensitive dissolves of small-town-America imagery.\r\nOne of the jarring voices of modernity is a local radio DJ whose show\r\napparently consists entirely of misogynist rants; you know, most local radio\r\nstations, even the most talk-oriented, do provide weather reports every now and\r\nthen. I mentioned the cinematography before; it\u2019s by David George, and it\u2019s\r\nlovely, but every now and again Swartzwelder and his editors string together\r\nseveral of said images for interludes that could be characterized as\r\n\u201cMalick-lite.\u201d This speaks, finally, to the movie\u2019s most substantial flaw,\r\nwhich is that with respect to pacing, Swartzwelder, going for \u201cthoughtful,\u201d instead\r\nachieves \u201cglacial.\u201d A romance wants to sweep viewers up, not bog them down.\r\nStill, \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d is both unusual and intelligent enough that, despite it not being entirely MY cup of tea, I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019ll succeed at doing at\r\nleast a little more than addressing the converted.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "1922", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "2017 has truly been the year of Stephen King, but the last in a long line of films and TV shows is, in some ways, the most surprising. A remake of \u201cIt\u201d was inevitable, even if no one expected it to be the box office behemoth it became. \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d was in some state of pre-production for years, and Mike Flanagan personally brought his vision for \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d to the big/small screen of Netflix. On TV, \u201cThe Mist\u201d felt like an obvious choice in a post-\u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d world (and was truly awful) while the bestselling success of \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d made that TV adaptation inevitable. Which brings us to \u201c1922,\u201d a 131-page novella contained in King\u2019s 2010 anthology Full Dark, No Stars. It\u2019s a decent piece of work, but not one that screams feature film, and the relative thinness of the source material hurts Zak Hilditch\u2019s film of the same name.\u00a0 Advertisement With leathered skin from working in the fields and a remarkable Southern drawl, Thomas Jane plays Wilfred James, a Nebraska farmer with a bitter wife named Arlette (Molly Parker) and a loyal son named Henry (Dylan Schmid). Arlette clearly dislikes life in the country and wants to sell her half of the farm to a local livestock company, but you can literally see Wilf\u2019s skin crawl when his wife dares mention moving to the city. That\u2019s for the dumb people, and the James family isn\u2019t dumb.    Wilf commits his first despicable act when he weaponizes his son\u2019s first love. Henry has fallen for a neighbor girl named Shannon Cotterie (Kaitlyn Bernard), and moving to the city will tear these young lovers apart. For reasons that aren\u2019t completely captured in a believable way, Wilfred decides that the only way to make this dilemma go away is for Arlette to die, and he convinces his son to help him. \u201c1922\u201d is told primarily in flashback, as a clearly-troubled Wilfred has come to a hotel room like the protagonist of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s The Tell-tale Heart, haunted by demons he himself created. So there\u2019s a sense that we\u2019re being told a story from an unreliable narrator, although not quite enough is made of that cinematically. No, for the most part, \u201c1922\u201d draws a straight line down a hill from a violent act to complete insanity, a not uncommon theme for King, who has long been fascinated by what happens when men choose murder over reason.    There is a very fine line between a film that burns slowly and one that just drags, and \u201c1922\u201d falls into the latter category a few too many times. The fact is that it\u2019s quite difficult to make a film about a man who may be going insane because you have to physically manifest what may just be the visions of a guilty man\u2019s conscience. To his credit, Thomas Jane does a marvelous job of conveying what\u2019s asked of him by material and filmmaker. At first, his slow drawl seemed a bit overdone, but the character work here is strong, especially as Wilf goes deeper and deeper over the edge of sanity. The problem is how little there is of interest here outside of Jane\u2019s work, which is again indicative of the issues with bringing a confessional novella to feature film form. The film isn't visually striking enough, the dialogue isn't memorable, and the message of the film is the relatively straightforward horror classic:\u00a0don't kill people. Some of the imagery contained in the\u00a0final half-hour of \u201c1922\u201d nearly justifies the journey to get there, I just couldn\u2019t help thinking that there\u2019s a tighter, more thrilling version of this story that runs much shorter, like an hour-long anthology horror series. Ultimately, it\u2019s the familiar case of a short story stretched too thin in a feature film, resulting in what will likely be the least-remembered project from 2017: The Year of King.

That\u2019s a blanket statement, but nothing that came out of the multiplex this summer contradicts it.\" Burr acknowledges that there was a lot to see in the arthouses, but if you only judge the state of the industry on the quality of summer tentpole blockbusters, then yes, movies may seem to be in a very sorry state. But open the lens up a little wider, and there is an entire galaxy of stuff going on\u2014challenging/complex films (where the flaws are more interesting than anything you'd see in a more risk-averse film), first features, foreign films, microbudget films with unknown actors, films doing what films\u2014at their best\u2014have always done. Outside of mainstream Hollywood, 2016 has been a tremendous year, with films like \"The Witch,\" \"Cemetery of Splendour,\" \"Krisha,\" \"The Fits,\" \"Everybody Wants Some!!\", \"The Hunt for the Wilderpeople,\" \"The Nice Guys,\" \"Disorder\" (the list goes on) ... You don't even have to go far off the beaten track to find an entire landscape of interesting stories told in unique ways.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Kicks,\" director Justin Tipping's feature debut\u2014the story of a teenage boy attempting to get back the sneakers stolen from him\u2014is one of those special films. \"Kicks\" is not without its flaws, but even the flaws show Tipping's willingness to take risks, to go for the big gesture and to go for it honestly. \"Kicks\" is a coming-of-age story with many nostalgic callbacks to other films, but it takes place in its own environment, upending the suburban cliche. \"Kicks\" is knowing and innocent, profound and goofy.\u00a0 Tipping grew up in the East Bay area of Oakland, and understands first-hand the teenage Cult of Sneakers, sneakers that create and affirm social status, sneakers as powerful signifiers. (Those who judge \"bling\" and \"conspicuous consumption\" probably have never wanted for anything in their lives.) Sneakers send a message: \"I am somebody.\" Sneakers also make you vulnerable to those who want what you have. There are sections of \"Kicks\" that are surreal and dreamlike, where time slows way, way down, and other sequences where the jagged reality of life in the neighborhood is palpable. Tipping and cinematographer Michael Ragen create a subjective and poetic mood from the very first shot, a mood that serves the film\u2014and its pure emotionalism\u2014very well. The point of view is always clear: This is the world as seen by 15-year-old Brandon (Jahking Guillory), smaller in size than most of his classmates, who wishes he was taller, bigger, but most of all wishes he had a great pair of sneakers, specifically the magnificent black and red Air Jordans he sees on another boy's feet in the hallway at school.\u00a0 Brandon hangs around with his two best friends, ladies' man Rico (Christopher Meyer) and wannabe ladies' man Albert (Notorious B.I.G.'s son, Christopher Jordan Wallace). There are no parental figures in sight. The three young actors have an unforced chemistry with one another, with a very real affection behind it. Each character has quirks that annoy the others (Albert ostentatiously buys extra-large condoms as Rico and Brandon roll their eyes at each other; Albert has never had a girlfriend in his life), but they have one another's backs. Their group dynamic is the glue of the film, and also provides necessary comic relief when things get grim. Brandon saves his money and finally buys an impressive pair of Jordans from a guy selling them out of the back of his truck. Brandon struts out of the house wearing them, like Tony Manero in \"Saturday\u00a0Night Fever,\" only to get jumped soon after by a gang led by the notorious silver-toothed Flaco (Kofi Siriboe), who steals Brandon's sneakers right off of his feet. Brandon ropes in his reluctant goofball buddies to join him in his quest to get his sneakers back. Advertisement Getting the sneakers back takes them to many wild and unfamiliar places (namely, Oakland), where the boys meet up with Brandon's terrifying and yet wise ex-con Uncle Marlon (Mahershala Ali, in a brilliant Mariana-Trench-deep performance), and Brandon's two stoner cousins, willing to help out their much-younger relative. Flaco is such bad news that everybody warns Brandon off, tells him to let the sneakers go, but Brandon declares, \"They're not just shoes. They're fucking J's.\" Nobody really can argue with that. Once in Oakland, the boys plunge into a whirlwind, funny and scary and confusing. One of the strongest elements of the script (co-written by Tipping and Joshua Beirne-Golden) is that Flaco ends up having complexity of his own because Tipping doesn't just follow Brandon, he also follows the sneakers: we see where Flaco puts them, we see who Flaco gives them to. This choice gives \"Kicks\" an undercurrent of thought-provoking ambivalence.\u00a0 The film opens with Brandon admitting in voiceoever that he has always dreamt of going into space, where it is quiet, where no one can mess with you. He dreams of a \"spaceman\" companion, a guardian angel astronaut who floats down into the middle of scenes, hovering over the streets, appearing at Brandon's side, encouraging Brandon silently, or just standing watch over his charge. Brandon's wishes for himself\u2014freedom, quiet, to be left alone\u2014is almost as strong as his wish for cool sneakers. Tipping picks and chooses the astronaut appearances very carefully, and so when the spaceman does appear it's not a gimmick or a device. It's the whole point. The astronaut, with mirrored helmet, hovers over the chaos, beckoning Brandon down this or that path. Sometimes the astronaut urges some pretty sketchy choices, but that's evidence that Brandon is, after all, only 15 years old. He wants to fit in, he also wants to be his own person. How do you reconcile those two things? The adolescent conundrum. At a certain point along the journey, Brandon steals a gun, in case he needs it for later. The Chekhov's gun plot point is not a fatal flaw, but it is a flaw. So much of \"Kicks\" ricochets along on its own energy, from hallucinations to chase scenes, to party scenes, to group conversations. The gun comes from a less imaginative, less personal movie, and the tension it generates is empty. But the weird thing about a flaw in a movie like \"Kicks,\" is that it highlights just how good, how strong, the rest of it really is. Elia Kazan talked and wrote constantly about the \"spine\" of his films, and how that spine had to be evident in every scene, every character, every moment. Once he understood the spine, it led him to the artistic choices he made. It takes an extremely clear vision to pull that off, and Tipping has that clear vision. This is a beautiful film and a major directorial debut. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Sausage Party", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "This relentlessly scabrous cartoon comedy\u2014which, by the way, to anyone old enough to remember Ralph Bakshi, is not a \u201cfirst\u201d of any kind, not by a long shot\u2014opens with a view of an empty parking lot with an arc-roofed mega-market in the background. Inside, the corn, the fruit, the condiments and especially the hot dogs and their neighboring buns, packaged for Fourth of July sales, sing a silly hymn about their hopes for being \u201cchosen\u201d by the \u201cGods\u201d who will deliver them to \u201cthe Great Beyond.\u201d\u00a0 \n \u201cOh dear,\u201d I thought. \u201cDo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg want to be Trey Parker and Matt Stone now?\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement \n Not really, it turns out\u2014that song\u2019s the only original in the movie. But given that the hot dogs and the buns then engage in an exchange of dirty talk that makes Cartman in \u201cSouth Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut\u201d sound like Joel Osteen, \u201cSausage Party,\u201d directed by Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon from a script by Rogen, Goldberg, Ariel Shaffir and Kyle Hunter, with a story credit going to voice actor and executive producer Jonah Hill is spectacularly relentless in its profanity and sex talk and extends the metaphor of anthropomorphic groceries into territory you and I might not have even imagined. To wit, the movie\u2019s villain, or rather, sole-non-human villain, is an extremely irate feminine hygiene product voiced by Nick Kroll.\u00a0 \n Once in an interview the very humorous Kevin Smith said to me, \u201cComedy is so f**king subjective.\u201d I have to be honest here and say the comedy of \u201cSausage Party\u201d never really connected for me. I feel bad about this, because the voice cast contains not just super-talented actors but some friendly acquaintances who happen to be super-talented actors. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d like this if I still smoked weed,\u201d I thought at one point. The movie\u2019s prime mover, Rogen, is a doge of stoner humor, and he shows incredible discipline in this film by saving the first weed joke for twenty minutes in. I commend him for that. And I guess it\u2019s kind of funny that \"the imperishable\u201d\u2014three grocery items that let Rogen\u2019s frank Frank in on the fact that the Gods and the Great Beyond are just myths, and outside the supermarket there\u2019s only death and consumption\u2014get their buzz by smoking out of a kazoo. But I dunno. Even when I did smoke weed, it was never my favorite thing. And the allegorical structuring of the grocery community\u2014a nebbishy talking bagel and a goateed and belligerent piece of flatbread stand in for the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, for instance, and Nazi sauerkraut makes noises about eliminating \u201cthe Juice\u201d\u2014mostly struck me as an opportunistic ploy to get away with a lot of cruddy ethnic humor. The visual design of the picture was similarly crude and ugly, although the fact that one of the human characters looked as if he\u2019d stepped out of a Peter Bagge comic panel gave me intimations that something a little sharper overall could have been accomplished, if only \u2026 well, again I dunno.\u00a0 \n The movie picks up steam when a bunch of \u201cchosen\u201d franks meet their grisly fate\u2014all save one, the stunted Barry (Michael Cera) who escapes and finds himself in the clutches of a druggie who, upon injecting himself with cooked-down bath salts (no really) is able to see into the fourth dimension and realize his food has consciousness. This concern with \u201ctransdimensional metaphysics,\u201d as one of my colleagues called it in an after-screening discussion, removes the movie from the standard-issue-Bill-Maher-atheism direction I had thought it was going in. But again, I didn\u2019t quite buy it. I did a lot of drugs back in the day, but in my brief exploration of psychedelics I never had the epiphany that mass-produced comestibles had sentience. Maybe it was just bad luck on my part. Once, while tripping at a weekend party in Connecticut, I had intimations of the cosmic while watching deer ticks explode from the heat on the patio of the house where I was staying. But never a talking bag of potato chips.\u00a0 \n Anyway, this tack actually continues up until the film\u2019s d\u00e9nouement, the only portion of it to wrangle a chuckle out of me. Your mileage may vary, as they say. Also, hugs not drugs. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The novelty of \"found footage\" wore off almost immediately upon arrival, and yet the \"style\" persists, despite the fact (or maybe because of the fact) that it's tired and lazy. \"Found footage\" requires too much forgiveness on the part of the audience. If you find yourself thinking, as I did, during \"Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones\", the fifth installment in the wildly popular series of films, \"Why wouldn't he turn off the spotlight on his camera so as not to be detected by the hungry coven of witches looking to devour him?\" then you're dead in the water. And so is the film. Thankfully, the entertaining chemistry between the two young leads in \"Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones\" (Andrew Jacobs and Jorge Diaz), almost saves it.  Advertisement Evil spirits are up to their old tricks in \"The Marked Ones\", and this time the action takes place in Oxnard, California, in a working-class Latino neighborhood, a welcome change in style and feel from the other more generic suburban installments. Jesse (Jacobs) and Hector (Diaz) live in a crowded apartment complex, with multigenerational family members crowded into small rooms. Both have just graduated from high school and seem to have no plans, no jobs, no goals. The only thing they have any interest in is fooling around with their new video camera. At first, they just film each other doing dumb stunts involving laundry baskets and staircases. Hector draws a penis on Jesse's face while he sleeps. Hilarity ensues. They do shots of tequila with Jesse's feisty grandmother (Renee Victor). The only reason this banal footage has any entertainment value is because of the two actors. Their energy together feels unselfconscious; it doesn't feel like acting. They seem like real boys, real friends.  Soon, the boys become curious about Anna (Gloria Sandoval), a downstairs neighbor. Weird moaning sounds and bumps come up through the grate at night. The boys attach the camera to a wire, lower it through the grate, and, to their amazement, observe frumpy Anna, in the nude, painting a red circle on the stomach of a gorgeous naked woman. Again, the \"found footage\" trope requires that you turn off your brain that pesters you with questions such as, \"That apartment down there has four rooms. Why would those two naked ladies choose to stand in the exact spot where the camera can pick up the action through the grate?\" The fact that what the boys observe is disturbingly ritualistic is erased by the reality of the real live boobs on display down there.  The jokes stop when Anna turns up dead.  Naturally, the boys have to break into her apartment (now a crime scene) in the middle of the night to investigate. Because, of course. There are some legitimate scares, although most of them are of the \"It was just a cat!\" variety. Jesse and Hector loop in one of Jesse's cousins, Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh). The three kids discover, sitting around one of those old low-tech electronic Simon devices one night (a fun throwback detail), that the device appears to be tapped into the paranormal spirits, acting like a Ouija board, answering \"Yes\" or \"No\" questions, to the astonishment of the three kids huddled around Simon. But then things become more serious. Jesse has a mysterious bite on his arm. People disappear. And yet, again and again, they sneak into Anna's apartment to continue their filmed investigation.  Advertisement Christopher Landon, involved as a writer and producer of the other \"Paranormal Activity\" films, steps into the director's role for the first time, and it is to his credit that he lets the dynamic between Hector and Jesse be the film's anchor. The plot is a dime a dozen, handled better and scarier on any individual episode of \"Supernatural\". But Hector and Jesse are adorable goofball guides, whose shared response to a paranormal event involves them whispering \"What the f___\" at each other, punctuated by giggling and bong hits.  The final scene of \"The Marked Ones\" loops us back to the first film, in an eerie tesseract, leaving the way open for more installments. Found footage may not be here to stay, but it hasn't exited stage right just yet.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Entourage", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "By the bitter end of its eight-season run, HBO\u2019s \u201cEntourage\u201d\r\nhad twisted its own narrative to a degree that it was barely recognizable from\r\nthe beginning of the series. When it started, \u201cEntourage\u201d was the story of\r\nthree average guys and their decidedly not average best friend with the\r\nmovie-star good looks, trying to make it in the cutthroat world of Hollywood\r\nwith only their loyalty to each other and NYC roots to keep them above the\r\nspoiled fray. We could relate to Vinny, Eric, Johnny and Turtle. By the end,\r\nthe boys of \u201cEntourage\u201d were men, and they were the exact kind of narcissists\r\nthat the show felt like it mocked at the beginning. Success was the most\r\nimportant thing in their lives, and the show became little more than a story of\r\na dream fulfilled, despite the occasional laugh. It wasn\u2019t about the guy who\r\nwent to Hollywood and stayed himself, bro. It was about the guy who went to\r\nHollywood and slept with models, had all the new toys, won awards, etc., bro.  Advertisement Four years after \u201cEntourage\u201d went off the air (although it\r\nfeels much longer), creator Doug Ellin is back with the inevitable film version\r\nof his show, continuing the same tonal problems of the last few seasons of the program only in a longer, bigger, more misogynist form. Much like the series, even in its lowest\r\npoints, there are still a few laughs from the supporting cast, and Ellin paces\r\nthe piece well (it doesn\u2019t feel nearly as long as the neverending \u201cSex and the\r\nCity\u201d movies), but \u201cEntourage\u201d mistakenly keeps its characters floating in\r\nrarefied air, giving us no way to relate to them or care about them. Vinny and\r\nhis buddies have become easier to correlate with the Kardashians than the\r\ndreamers they used to be. And that makes for a film that keeps its audience at\r\na distance, never surprising them at all narratively and barely moving the\r\nneedle for its characters. It is fan fiction in film form. After ending a marriage that lasted only nine days with a\r\nhot person party in Ibiza (\u201cEntourage\u201d takes place in that dream movie world in\r\nwhich every extra in every scene from the people walking down the\r\nstreet to all the patrons of a restaurant could be a fashion model),\r\nVinny Chase (Adrian Grenier) wants to get back in the movie game. He calls up\r\nAri (Jeremy Piven) and convinces him to re-join his team as the producer on his\r\nnext flick, a futuristic take on the Stevenson classic, \u201cHyde.\u201d One catch:\r\nVinny wants to direct.  Ellin\u2019s script ignores most of the production process, immediately\r\nzipping us forward to days after filming has wrapped. Ari and his producing\r\npartners, including Texan walking-stereotype financiers played by Billy Bob\r\nThornton and Haley Joel Osment, still haven\u2019t seen a cut of the film, which\r\nVinny is clearly apprehensive about showing to anyone. Part of the problem is\r\nthat he needs more money on the already over-budget film to finish\r\npost-production. Ari agrees to go to Texas to talk to the money men about\r\ngetting the cash, but Chase is going to have to get over his nerves and show\r\nthe movie to everybody soon. Advertisement Meanwhile, E (Kevin Connolly) is having a baby with Sloan\r\n(Emmanuelle Chriqui) even though the two aren\u2019t together any more. Which means\r\nhe gets to have sex with multiple people one day and go to Lamaze the next. E\r\nand Sloan were always one of the weaker subplots of the HBO show and nothing\r\nhas changed here. In better news, Johnny Drama (Kevin Dillon) gets to steal a\r\nfew scenes with a solid arc about his \u201cbaby bro\u201d\u2019s movie being the one that\r\nfinally gives him a break. Finally, Turtle (Jerry Ferrara), who seems to have\r\nmade a million dollars for every pound he\u2019s lost, which is quite a few, almost\r\nliterally runs into Ronda Rousey, and tries to start a relationship with her.  The VERY little tension of \u201cEntourage\u201d comes when the son of\r\nChase\u2019s main financier, played with smarm by Osment, reports back that he hates\r\nthe cut of \u201cHyde\u201d that he\u2019s seen, especially the four scenes that include\r\nJohnny Drama. Will Vinny cut out his brother and betray his vision to get the\r\nmovie done? Have you seen the show? At the end of HBO\u2019s \u201cEntourage,\u201d the characters were wildly\r\nsuccessful, rich and happy. Guess what? They still are! Rather than take any\r\nchances, Ellin barely wrote a plot for the \u201cEntourage\u201d movie, using his time\r\ninstead to call in celebrity cameos and think of the prettiest locations in\r\nwhich to shoot them. Most of the dialogue is forced and unnatural, especially\r\nin the Connolly/Chriqui and Ferrara/Rousey subplots, but that\u2019s because it\r\ndoesn\u2019t matter what people say in the world of \u201cEntourage.\u201d All that matters is\r\nwho they party with, who they sleep with, and how much money they make. And the\r\nfilm suffers greatly from a plague of TV-to-film adaptations in that it gets\r\nstrikingly repetitive given that the people behind it are used to writing\r\n30-minutes narratives and spin their wheels when they try to go feature-length.\r\nWithout Piven and Dillon to keep it entertaining, it would be absolutely\r\ndreadful.  \u201cEntourage\u201d ended in such a way that I don\u2019t think even\r\ndiehard fans of the HBO show were overly concerned about Vinny and the boys.\r\nThere were no loose ends to tie up. And, in that sense, \u201cEntourage\u201d feels like\r\nanother victory lap for characters who had already won the race of life.\r\nInstead of challenging his characters or giving them something new to do, Ellin\r\njust high fives them on the way to the winner\u2019s circle.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Child's Pose", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Mothers are blamed for a lot, in cinema and in life. Their love is essential to a child's development, but too much of that same love is damaging. Wanting a close relationship with your adult child is healthy, but how close is too close? One of the greatest strengths of \"Child's \r\nPose\", Romania's 2014 Oscar-entry and winner of the Golden Bear this year in Berlin, is that these questions are presented, but no real answers are provided. The answers we get are murky, ambiguous, \r\ndisturbing. The truth is there, somewhere, but lost in an abyss of recriminations, resentment, and things too dark to discuss. It's an extremely strong and upsetting film, yet another example of the fascinating things going on in Romania's new wave, with a breathtaking lead performance by Luminita Gheorghiu as Cornelia, the competent career-woman in Bucharest, determined to clear her adult son's name. Advertisement Cornelia is a nosy mother. She is estranged from her son Barbu (Bogdan Dumitrache), and blames that estrangement on Barbu's girlfriend, whom she can barely reference without a sneer. Cornelia is a wealthy successful architect and gave her son all the privileges available to him in the chaotic post-Ceau\u0219escu era. \u00a0And yet he drifts, he lacks focus, he wants nothing to do with his mother. When he hits and kills a peasant child while speeding and is arrested for drunk driving, Cornelia, wrapped in furs, swoops in to the rescue. \"Child's Pose\", like so many other current Romanian films, is really about class. Cornelia is part of the Bucharest elite, and her friends are surgeons and famous opera singers. The family of the dead child are traditional peasants, described by one of the arresting officers as \"very simple people\". When Cornelia and the dead child's parents finally meet, in a scene almost absurd\u2014Cornelia chooses that moment to babble about her son's achievements and what a wonderful athlete he was as a teenager\u2014the culture clash is so enormous that it is as though nobody speaks the same language. Cornelia is convinced that her son is innocent, although all evidence points to the contrary. She sets out to clear his name, to make sure he is not railroaded by the cops (who all treat her with a mixture of impatience and condescension, an interloper in their more practical world). She is desperate to mend the relationship, and yet Barbu is totally closed to her overtures. Gheorghiu as Cornelia is elegant and hard, pained and calculating, competent and shifty. She chain-smokes, and does so in a glamorous way, holding the cigarette up and close to her face. Her eyes shift around the room, taking things in, thinking, re-evaluating, hedging her bets. She is not likable; she knows it and it\r\n doesn't matter to her. At the raucous birthday party thrown for her early in the film, she dances around with her husband in an empty ante-room, laughing and twirling like a little girl, and there's something tragic about her joie de vivre. There is damage here, somewhere, catastrophic and complete. Similar to Bong Joon-ho's \"Mother\", Cornelia is a mother who will stop at nothing to protect her son. Much of what Cornelia does is underhanded, at times indefensible. And Barbu is no prize. Cornelia describes him to others as \"warm and generous\", but that seems to be her fantasy of him. In the film, he remains mostly a sullen mystery, and only through a show-stopper of a scene between Cornelia and Barbu's girlfriend Carmen (Ilinca Goia), when Carmen opens up in graphic detail about their sex life (all as Cornelia sits silent and eager for the details), do we learn anything about him. We understand very early on that Cornelia is an unreliable narrator of her own life. In her version of events, she is a scorned martyr, she has done nothing wrong, all she \r\nhas done is love him, perhaps too much, but is that a crime? In one provocative scene, Cornelia rubs healing ointment into Barbu's back before he goes to sleep. The expression of relish and satisfaction on her face as she kneels astride her son is more eloquent than any dialogue could ever attempt. Advertisement Written by R\u0103zvan R\u0103dulescu (who also wrote \"The Death of Mr. Lazarescu\"), \"Child's Pose\" was directed by Calin Peter Netzer, and the film announces him as a major talent. The hand-held cinematography, gritty and raw, gives the film an immediate and urgent documentary feel, and each moment has a great sense of both the absurd and the poignant. Even minor characters are well-drawn and captured in small details that tell you who they are. In one early scene, Cornelia invites her maid to have a cup of coffee. Cornelia always has ulterior motives: her maid \r\nalso cleans Barbu's apartment, so Cornelia begins to grill the maid on the state of affairs at her son's place. Cornelia, smoking a cigarette and elegantly chilly with her blonde coiffure and beaded top, sits comfortably high in the culture's hierarchy and oozes oblivious privilege, all as the maid, wearing a third- or fourth-hand University of Southern California sweatshirt, squirms in embarrassment at being questioned about what books are on Barbu's nightstand. And even that question contains an ulterior motive: Cornelia gave Barbu two books, one by Herta Muller and one by Orhan Pamuk, and she wants to know if he has read them. \"They both won the Nobel, you know,\" Cornelia informs the maid, who can't even feign interest at such incomprehensible words. What makes Cornelia complex is that she operates from love. Her love is titanic, monumental, unstoppable. The film does not judge her. It merely presents her. It shows us where love can take us, what love becomes when it is thwarted, how twisted it can grow when it is not nurtured. \r\nAnd Gheorghiu, familiar to audiences already from her performances in \"Beyond the Hills\", \"4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days\", \"12:08 East of Bucharest\" and \"The Death of Mr. Lazarescu\", is fearless. Her performance as Cornelia is iconic in scope.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Cloverfield Paradox", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Let's go out on a limb and predict that February 4, 2018 will be seen as a watershed moment in the history of moving pictures. That was the Super Bowl Sunday when Netflix released the third entry in the popular \"Cloverfield\" series of science-fiction thrillers\u2014not to theaters, or even with a traditional long-lead buildup to online release, but simply by announcing that it was available that night, by way of an ad that ran during the game itself. Then the service sat back and watched social media light up with near-live reviews by people who were more interested in a new sci-fi film than in the game. By the following morning, reviews like this one started to appear, asking what it all meant\u2014not the movie, mind you, but the implications of releasing it this way.  Advertisement Turns out there were two masterstrokes here, and they were both about advertising. One was announcing what was, in essence, little more than a new Netflix menu selection during the telecast of North America's most-watched sporting event, guaranteeing that tens of millions of viewers would at least consider checking it out that night. The other masterstroke was figuring out how to generate excitement for a movie that might've barely made an impression had it been released in a more typical manner. \"The Cloverfield Paradox\" is a bit of a scam job, promising to reconcile entries in a series that have little in common save for a shared genre. It fizzles so badly at the end that you might legitimately wonder if it ever had anything to do with the other two films in the first place, or if it was produced independently of the series and retroactively added. Directed by Julius Onah and written by Oren Uziel, the film is set during a horrendous dystopian future in which the power grid keeps failing and the Russians are pondering a land invasion of the United Kingdom. Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays Hamilton, a scientist who leaves her doctor husband Michael (Roger Davies) on Earth to join the multinational, multi-ethnic crew of an orbital collider that's supposed to fire up and solve the world's energy problems.  Complications ensue, obviously: they're up there for quite a long time, and their actions somehow remove them from existence in their original reality and deposit them somewhere else, maybe on an alternate timeline. The relationships between people are subtly different, as are their own personal histories. People who should know each other don't, etc. Meanwhile, back on the original Earth, Michael wonders what happened to his wife and the space station where she once worked, and gets embroiled in a parallel adventure protecting a young girl from various threats, one of which might be making a cameo from another \"Cloverfield\" film.  Hamilton's colleagues in orbit include such ace character actors as Daniel Oyelowo, Chris O'Dowd, Daniel Bruhl, Aksel Hennie and Zhang Ziyi (speaking entirely in Chinese with subtitles, a nice touch). Frustratingly generic character writing ensures that none of them makes a strong impression, although the movie does use Hennie's chararacter, a paranoid Russian, as a human hand grenade, rather like the Michael Biehn character in \"The Abyss,\" and wisely gives O'Dowd most of the comic relief lines, which he sells but never oversells (his reaction to a moment of stomach-churning body horror is Bill Paxton-worthy).\u00a0  Advertisement Onah is a nimble and confident director, jumping right into the middle of action, giving the sci-fi vistas (in particular the orbital platform, which spins like a multilayered gyroscope) appropriately grandiose introductions, lingering on beautiful people and objects just because they're beautiful, and observing intriguing little details of production design (such as a faux-bagel that assembles itself in a kitchen contraption, and a tube of liquid metal sealant that works like a caulk gun). It's an\u00a0offhand style that's characteristic of post-\"Alien\" science fiction, where we're more awestruck by the world onscreen than any of the characters are. There are other compensatory pleasures, including the refreshingly straightforward and comprehensible photography by Dan Mindel (who shot the first two J.J. Abrams \"Star Trek\" movies, far more flashily) and Bear McCreary's music, which is reminiscent of Elliot Goldenthal's majestically bummed out score for \"Alien 3\" and adds about $10 million to the film's budget by daring to sound big.  But for the most part, this is a bust of a movie, the kind that would probably have otherwise gotten dumped to theaters in January by a studio looking to cut its losses. And it makes the series feel not like an anthology but a brand name guaranteeing medium-budget genre action with a bit more intelligence than was probably necessary but nowhere near the aesthetic ambition required to really stand out. The second \"Cloverfield\" entry, \"10 Cloverfield Lane,\" was a medium-budget art-house sci-fi film, the kind that might've shocked everyone in the '80s by making a fortune at drive-ins and strip malls; it became a hit on the basis of its ensemble acting and its unnerving intimacy\u2014never mind that ending, which confirmed that it was taking place in a different universe from the first \"Cloverfield,\" a homegrown American answer to a \"Godzilla\" movie. This one cobbles together scraps from the \"Alien\" series, \"Event Horizon,\" \"Final Destination, \"Solaris\" and about a dozen other films, doing a creditable job of seeming as if it has a lot on its mind until the moment arrives (soon into the film, alas) when you realize it doesn't.  J.J. Abrams, whose name is on the film as a producer, perfected the so-called \"mystery box\" method of storytelling that promises profound and shattering revelations only to pivot to bromides like, \"We should all be nicer to each other\" or \"Let's learn to forgive ourselves.\" The script to this one falls well within that wheelhouse. I'd like to visit the alternate universe where \"The Cloverfield Paradox\" is worthy of the stroke of PR genius that launched it.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Baby Driver", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Baby is a young man who creates remixes of his life. He records conversations had around him (almost always around and not with him) on an old-fashioned mini-cassette recorder, and then mixes them into songs with some wonderfully antiquated keyboard and rhythm equipment. The first one we see him create is called \u201cWas He Slow,\u201d using a question asked by an accomplice about Baby\u2019s mental capacity as a hook. Much like Baby turns the world around him into music, writer/director Edgar Wright remixes the movies and tunes that have influenced him into the wildly joyous and fantastically entertaining \u201cBaby Driver.\u201d As CGI robots clang into each other and superheroes take to the sky, here\u2019s Wright to ask if you remember how movies used to thrill us with a turn of phrase, a squeal of a wheel, a diving plot twist, or a romantic kiss. \u201cBaby Driver\u201d feels both influenced by the modern era of self-aware, pop-culture filmmaking and charmingly old-fashioned at the same time, which is only one of its minor miracles. It\u2019s as much fun as you\u2019re going to have in a movie theater this year. Advertisement Yes, his name is \u201cB-A-B-Y, Baby\u201d (Ansel Elgort). At least, that\u2019s the name he gives people when asked, although he\u2019s more often ignored. He\u2019s the nearly silent getaway driver for a robbery syndicate managed by Doc (Kevin Spacey), who organizes the crime, hires three criminals, and then puts them in Baby\u2019s car. You see, Baby can drive. But he needs music to do it. After a car accident as a kid left him with tinnitus, he spends the vast majority of his waking hours with ear buds in his ears to drown out the ringing. And the world around him moves to the music on one of his many iPods\u2014he has various ones for different moods. Sometimes the world seems to respond to his choice, sometimes his choice seems to influence the world around him\u2014either way, music is as essential to the success of \u201cBaby Driver\u201d as it was to \u201cLa La Land,\u201d maybe more. Take the riveting first scene. Three criminals\u2014Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), and Griff (Jon Bernthal)\u2014leap from a car outside of a bank just as Baby cues up \u201cBellbottoms\u201d by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in his 'buds. Everything from this point on moves in rhythm with the music from the slamming of the car doors after the bank robbers return to the squealing tires of one of the best car chase scenes in years. We\u2019ve seen countless action scenes scored to pop or rock songs, but how many have you seen in which the action works in unison with the music? And Wright takes this brilliant concept a step further, making even everyday normal activity feel like it\u2019s part of Baby\u2019s soundtrack. The sound of someone typing a text message on a phone or placing stacks of money on a table will work with the beat of a song, creating a film that has a rhythm, flow and structure from first frame to last that works in conjunction with its soundtrack. It\u2019s fluid and jaw-dropping\u2014the kind of thing you want to see immediately again after it\u2019s over to catch all the things you missed. The last paragraph probably makes \u201cBaby Driver\u201d sound like a music video, and has likely pushed out potential viewers looking for more substance than style. Trust me when I say that Wright doesn\u2019t skimp on the former. There\u2019s enough story and action here to satisfy without the music that drives the filmmaking. Much of the joy of this film is watching it unfold so I\u2019ll be brief with plot. Baby had a brief dalliance with crime, and he made the mistake of robbing from Doc, who now forces him to drive as penance. He\u2019s almost done. He has one more job for Doc and then he\u2019ll be back to his normal life. Of course, we all know how that typically turns out in crime movies. And when Baby meets a lovely waitress named Debora (Lily James), he finds a reason to go straight. That\u2019s all you need to know. Advertisement At its core, \u201cBaby Driver\u201d recalls decades of movies that anchored their narratives on criminals and the art of the car chase. There\u2019s a remarkably old-fashioned sensibility to the way Wright structures and details his film, and it\u2019s not just because his two genetically blessed stars look like they could have walked out of a 1940s noir (their All-American aesthetic is even more striking in a few gorgeous black-and-white shots that recall old Hollywood even more). \u201cBaby Driver\u201d is a high-concept film that never underwhelms detail, and it\u2019s those charming little beats within the overall tune that hold it together. It helps greatly that few people know how to assemble a cast like Edgar Wright. Elgort and James are engaging, charismatic leads with fantastic chemistry. Unlike most Hollywood action movies, the survival of the heroes here becomes something we actively root for instead of just know is likely to happen. The \u201cvillains\u201d of the piece are perfectly cast and directed as well, particularly Spacey and Jamie Foxx as the menacing Bats. Both roles are written and cast in a way that they could have stolen focus with performances that play to the cheap seats but neither actor ever does. Foxx is particularly phenomenal in a role that\u2019s both funny and filled with simmering danger. It\u2019s one of those films where every single role, from the burly diner chef to the sweet post office employee, feels like it was cast with exactly the right person. It creates a sense of additional magic in a film when you can sense that every single element, even the most minor ones, is working exactly as its creator intended. There\u2019s an energy that you can feel in the theater when a movie is really working. It\u2019s the guy next to you jumping a bit in his seat as a car takes a hard corner. It\u2019s the woman behind you laughing extra hard at a joke. It\u2019s the sense that everyone is fully engaged, almost tapping their feet to the rhythm of the film. I still believe this is why most people go to the movies with crowds of strangers\u2014to feel that shared magic and nod their heads in unison to the cinematic tune. \u201cBaby Driver\u201d will be one of your favorite songs of the year. Listen to it with a crowd. And loud. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Abortion: Stories Women Tell", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Watching HBO\u2019s \u201cAbortion:\r\nStories Women Tell,\u201d which gets a limited theatrical release this week before an\r\nairing on the network, I was struck by how many documentaries on the subject I\u2019ve\r\nseen in just the last few years. And I was struck even more by the variety in\r\ntheir approach: \u201cTrapped\u201d focuses on the laws that are essentially making\r\nabortion illegal in several states; The excellent \u201cAfter Tiller\u201d looks at the\r\nfew doctors left willing to perform third-trimester abortions and the danger\r\nthey face to do what they think is right. \u201cAbortion: Stories Women Tell\u201d has a clear focus that's right there in its title: approaching the subject from the women with\r\nfirst-hand experience. In an interesting twist, director Tracy Droz Tragos\r\ndoesn\u2019t only speak to the women who have chosen to have abortions but people\r\nlike the security guard at the clinic (nicknamed Chi Chi because she\u2019s small\r\nand feisty like a Chihuahua) and even those on the other side of the issue,\r\nincluding prominent female voices in the pro-life organization 40 Days For\r\nLife. But what\u2019s essential about Tragos\u2019 film is that the male voices we hear\r\nare almost exclusively on the fringe: men in the parking lot of a clinic\r\nyelling about Jesus or lawmakers trying to essentially subvert Roe v. Wade.\r\nThis is an issue about women\u2019s rights and so this powerful film exclusively listens to the stories\r\nthat women tell.\u00a0 Advertisement Some of those stories\r\nare among the most resonant I\u2019ve heard in a documentary this year. Particularly\r\nmemorable is the tale of Amie, a young woman who simply can\u2019t afford to have another baby\r\nas she already works multiple jobs to keep her child fed as it is. Several of\r\nthe people we meet in \u201cAbortion: Stories Women Tell\u201d are in this situation:\r\nknowing that their family will go hungry if there\u2019s another mouth to feed.\r\nOthers are in that tragic position in which they\u2019ve learned that their\r\nbaby won\u2019t survive after birth. Others are in abusive relationships. A\r\nwoman tells a heartbreaking tale of being with such an abusive partner that she\r\nknew bringing a baby into the situation would only put her child\u2019s safety at\r\nrisk. It\u2019s important to realize, although Tragos doesn\u2019t underline this fact,\r\nthat every story is different. Money, health, abuse\u2014everyone has a reason, and\r\ndespite what pro-life proponents would have you believe, none of those reasons\r\nfeel poorly-considered. \u201cAbortion: Stories Women\r\nTell\u201d takes an interesting turn when it crosses the aisle, presenting\r\ninterviews with people trying to shut down clinics in Missouri (which they have\r\nessentially done, sending women who need abortions over state lines to the more\r\nlenient Illinois). Tragos\u2019 allegiance is clear, but these films often falter\r\nwhen they demonize the opponent, and hearing a woman honestly speak about how\r\nshe believes she\u2019s saving lives when she protests abortion clinics highlights\r\nthe complexity of the issue. She doesn\u2019t have any doubt that\r\nwhat she\u2019s doing is right. And Tragos\u2019 film is at its best when it\u2019s interested\r\nin commonality. There\u2019s a great moment in which a woman who works at the\r\nIllinois clinic where most of the film takes place sings along to protestors\r\nwith \u201cJesus Loves Me.\u201d One of the last lines of the film is \u201cDo what you think\r\nis right.\u201d So many people involved with the war for the right to legal and safe\r\nabortions and those against them are\r\ndoing what they think is right. While \u201cAbortion: Stories\r\nWomen Tell\u201d strengthens its clear pro-choice stance by allowing the other side\r\nsome time in front of the camera, it is not an overtly political film. We learn\r\nabout the dynamic along this Midwestern border, in which one state has TRAP laws so tough that it pushes women in need to another, and that naturally\r\ncarries some political baggage, but it is the women and their stories that\r\nmatter. It is the faces, particularly Amie\u2019s incredible courage and humanity to\r\nlet us share a very difficult journey with her, that people will remember. And\r\nthat\u2019s why these films keep getting made, and keep mattering to viewers. As people\r\ndebate the issue in presidential campaigns, it is the world of the documentary\r\nthat reminds us what this issue is really about: Women. Listen to their stories.

{"Title": "La Bare", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Actor Joe Manganiello (\"True Blood,\" \"Magic Mike,\") had originally conceived of \"La Bare\" as a reality TV series detailing the backstage life of the male dancers at La Bare in Dallas, known as \"the most popular male strip club in the world.\" Manganiello's research for playing his role in \"Magic Mike\" had pierced through his preconceived notions of what male strippers were like, and he was curious to learn more. \"La Bare\" shows\u00a0its reality-TV origin in its structure, to sometimes a clich\u00e9d degree, but overall it is a friendly and affectionate backstage look at the world of the mostly-straight male dancers at La Bare. Advertisement There are \"confessionals\" with the various dancers, all of whom have different strengths (one says, \"I can't dance at all. But I can f***. So I use that in my act.\"), there are glimpses of the shows themselves, the screaming women, there are interviews with fans.\u00a0Some of the really interesting elements are merely sketched in, like how La Bare, which has been around since the '70s, turned itself around from a kind of skeevy dive into the showstopping club it is today. A new owner came along, a Russian named Alex, who is interviewed wearing a T-shirt with \"CCCP\" across the front. He wanted to create a strip club that was run like a business; he wanted to hire dancers who thought like businessmen and\u00a0weren't drug addicts or troublemakers; he wanted to build a brand. And he did. Alex would be compelling enough for an entire documentary. The dancers come from all walks of life. One talks about how he was homeschooled and not allowed to listen to secular music, which meant he had no idea how to dance \"to the beat\" in his early time as a dancer. One had owned a restaurant, which he then lost, and\u00a0uses dancing as a way to make money to open up another restaurant. One, with a blue mohawk and multiple piercings, talks about his time in Afghanistan and Iraq as a Ranger. Overseeing the dancers at La Bare is a larger-than-life personality named Randy (aka \"The Master Blaster\"), who has been a dancer for 34 straight years (he's in the Guinness Book of World Records). He jokes that he has now performed for\u00a0five generations of women. Randy has no children of his own and sees the dancers as his sons. He \"raises them,\" reminding them of the Golden Rule, for example. He puts them on diets, he helps them with workout plans. Randy is unable to speak without making a motivational speech. He has a devoted fan base. To counteract the idea that stripping is somehow a depressing job, and the idea that male strippers are even more \"beyond the pale\" than females, \"La Bare\" highlights the positive to destabilize those expectations. We are accustomed to female strippers being presented as victims, a simplistic attitude, and certainly not true for all of them. \"La Bare\" shows the dancers as a tight group of friends, highlighted by the fact that just prior to filming, one of the dancers, the beloved \"Angelo\" (Ruben Riguero), was killed after a scuffle at a local club for apparently no reason. But other than that, the \"horror stories\" one may expect do not materialize. These guys are more like body builders, concerned about salt intake and limiting alcohol consumption. They also try not to sleep with clientele. It's just bad business. Advertisement Each guy is extremely open to the camera, a tribute to Manganiello's questioning and attitude. One can imagine the suspicion with which the project may have been treated initially. The dancers are sensitive about being misrepresented. The openness of the interviews is captivating. The difference between strip clubs catering to men and those catering to women is discussed in the film, by both the owners of the club, as well as the dancers and the women who flock to La Bare. La Bare invests a lot of money in the shows, and each guy has a particular \"act\", some of them elaborate to an almost Cirque de Soleil degree. The guys do calendars and private parties and promotions and it's all about creating a brand for themselves. A female stripper says about all of this, \"For these guys, it is their whole lives.\" For her, not so much. So what is different about a strip club catering to women as opposed to men? One of the La Bare regulars observes that \"men are like a microwave, and women are like an oven \u2026 we need that pre-heat time.\"\u00a0Throughout the film the dancers as well as the owners of the club echo that thought. For the women who come to La Bare, they want the romance and the fantasy of the show itself, they want to be drawn in and swept away. To the dancers, female fantasy is the air they breathe: they don't treat it with condescension or contempt, they cater to it directly. It's strangely refreshing in today's climate where there are worried think-pieces about what 50 Shades of Grey means and what should we DO about it? \"La Bare\" takes its time to profile some of the side figures, like Pablo the backstage hand, or the guy who DJs for the club. These sections feel like filler. They sag and lag. It is the dancers who fascinate, and in its own stealthy way, \"La Bare\" opens up a little bit of breathing space around the idea of masculinity, how it operates, and what it actually looks like. There are definitely depths to be plumbed in the conversation about objectification and sexuality, particularly in the realm of men. \"La Bare\" approaches the issue indirectly, and yet in a way, it's the whole point. Men who put their sexuality out there like that are often seen as \"feminized\", and that word is used an insult (disturbing because it assumes that being \"feminine\" is a negative). These guys don't worry about any of that. They are there as fantasy figures and they work hard to provide that fantasy. One of the dancers reports that he asked a woman why she likes coming to La Bare so often. She replied, \"When I come here, I feel pretty.\" That's a pretty strong statement about what these shows provide. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Rewrite", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "There was a period spanning from the near-mid 1990s to the\r\nearly 2000s when a particular kind of Hugh Grant movie ruled the romantic\r\ncomedy world. I don\u2019t mean every single Hugh Grant movie, but quite a few Hugh\r\nGrant movies, mind you. I call them the \u201cRedeemable S**ts\u201d films. That is, they\r\nfeature Mr. Grant at his slickest and most glibly charming, except he\u2019s a\r\nterrible-to-awful cad (but not to a Ted Bundy extent, of course, and\r\nthankfully) except also that he can be\r\nsaved, and it\u2019s only through forced exposure to and interaction with Better\r\nPeople that he can be saved.  Advertisement This formula, which arguably reached its commercial and, um,\r\nartistic peak with 2002\u2019s \u201cAbout A Boy\u201d drives Grant\u2019s latest picture, \u201cThe\r\nRewrite, \u201c which was written and directed by Marc Lawrence, who also created\r\n2007\u2019s \u201cMusic and Lyrics,\u201d an intermittently diverting rom-com co-starring Drew\r\nBarrymore that suggested that maybe a breather from the tried and true might be\r\nin order. Unfortunately for Grant, that breather consisted of the universally\r\nface-palmed 2009 \u201cDid You Hear About The Morgans\u201d and the misbegotten Wachowski\r\nliterary adaptation \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d in 2012. \u201cThe Rewrite,\u201d in which Grant plays\r\na once-acclaimed, now down-on-his-luck Hollywood screenwriter compelled to head\r\neast and teach a scenario-crafting class at a university in remote, cloudy,\r\nfine-cuisine-challenged Binghamton, New York, must have felt as cozy as a\r\nfavorite sweater to the actor.  And indeed, he gives great Hugh Grant cad once he touches\r\ndown in the college town, immediately insulting Jane Austen to an icy\r\ndepartment head (Alison Janney) whose specialty is Jane Austen, bedding down a\r\ncomely student (Bella Heathcote) even before convening his first session,\r\nadvising a \u201cStar Wars\u201d nerd to join a frat, and dribbling condescension on a\r\nplucky single mom who\u2019s going to school to improve herself but who may in fact\r\nhave some real talent.  Given that the aforementioned plucky single mom is played by\r\nMarisa Tomei, you have an idea where all this is going to end up.

{"Title": "Fed Up", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Are you a Peter Frampton fan? And when I say \"Peter Frampton fan,\" I mean a BIG Peter Frampton fan. I mean someone who goes back farther than his once-universally beloved 1976 hit double-LP \"Frampton Comes Alive.\" I mean someone who maybe goes as far back as The Herd with Frampton, although not necessarily. I\u2019ll cut to the chase. Are you someone who knows the 1973 album called \"Frampton\u2019s Camel,\" and a track on it called \"White Sugar\"? I\u2019m asking this question because, if you are, and if you do, you can pretty much skip the movie \"Fed Up,\" because Frampton\u2019s song \"White Sugar,\" the chorus of which condemns the titular substance as \"evil as the day you were born\" sums up the message of the new documentary \"Fed Up\" in a nutshell, or a teaspoon if you will.  Advertisement I don\u2019t mean to be glib. Or maybe I do. As someone who\u2019s struggled on and off with weight issues ever since my metabolism betrayed me in my mid-twenties, I suppose I\u2019m in some ways a member of this movie\u2019s target audience as an examination of America\u2019s rising obesity stats and of the food industry\u2019s economic interest in encouraging, or even enforcing, unhealthy eating habits.\u00a0 Over the course of its ninety or so minutes, \"Fed Up,\" executive produced by Katie Couric (who also narrates) and Laurie David, and directed by Stephanie Soechtig, offers up a lot of information about nutrition and the food industry, some of which I didn\u2019t know or had an only vague awareness of, and alternates talking head interviews with PhDs with mini-portraits of poignant obese kids and teens across this great land of ours. Along the way it explains why the magic words \"low fat\" aren\u2019t so magic, how the calories from an almond metabolize differently than the calories from a sweetened soft drink, and why high fructose corn syrup and, yes, white sugar is as evil as the days they were born.  \"I don\u2019t think high-fructose corn syrup is a good use of corn,\" former President Bill Clinton muses at one point in the film, going on to admit that his administration could have done more about this issue. (Is it just me or has Clinton said that about a LOT of things his administration ended up not doing much about? Hell, and I like the guy.) The movie pulls few punches in condemning collusion between the food industry and Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and even Michelle Obama\u2019s anti-obesity initiative\u2014supposedly, if you read National Review, a sacrament for liberals\u2014 comes in for criticism for emphasizing the wrong sides of the issue. The information is arguably compelling, and disturbing, but something about the whole delivery mode turned me off. As cinema, the movie is profoundly uninspired and commonplace, albeit well-made, or even slick. I\u2019m not sure whether the filmmakers knew that their slo-mo shots of sugar in heaping teaspoons is actually kind of mouth-watering, but there you go. More irksome is the fact that Katie Couric and Laurie David, both of whose personal fortunes were achieved with no small participation from the Coca Cola Company, have now decided to impart to us peons that the Coca Cola Company is in fact the devil. When, in fact, the Coca Cola Company is merely doing something that a larger system aggressively enables it to do. Like most movies of its bent, \"Fed Up\" can\u2019t admit the thing that Al Pacino gets so tetchy about at the climax of \"And Justice For All...,\" which is that \"the whole system is out of order.\" It can\u2019t\u2014won\u2019t\u2014see the forest for the trees, because it is in fact a product of the same system that produces Coca Cola. Why the viewer ought to trust it more than it trusts the Coca Cola Company is a question left unanswered. Anyway, I trust Peter Frampton. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Frank & Lola", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"Frank and Lola\" starts right in the middle of a frank sex scene between its leads, the fortysomething chef Frank (Michael Shannon) and the recent college graduate and would-be fashion designer Lola (Imogen Poots), and it continues in that vein, dropping us into the middle of moments, relationships and predicaments and expecting us to find our way through them. It's a terrific gambit, as well a welcome break from the preferred method of storytelling in romantic dramas, which is more along the lines of, \"Hi, John, how is your brother, who I haven't seen in twelve years, and who betrayed me?\" The problem is that, despite being played by two charismatic and more-than-capable actors, the title characters never click in the way they need to. They're too cool and vague for the volcanic story they enact. Advertisement Plot twists pile up, and a light-footed, psycho-sexual character study becomes something like a film noir revenge thriller. Frank goes to Paris, ostensibly to look into a potentially lucrative chef job set up by Lola's mother (Rosanna Arquette, overdoing the shallow self-regard and sexual voraciousness; when she tells Frank, \"I can't wait to taste your food,\" I expected her to add a cartoon-y meow). But the job interview is a pretext to confront the would-be patron (played by Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist), the owner of the Las Vegas hotel where Frank would serve as head chef. This man raped Lola years ago. She credits him with jump-starting a pattern of self-destructive sexual behavior, which includes an impulsive one-night stand at a hotel with a guy she admits means nothing to her (Frank is devastated).  So far, so good\u2014many a memorable seventies thriller has gotten by on less plot than \"Frank and Lola\" offers. But we're still left with the nagging feeling that debut writer/director Matthew Ross and his cast never quite got a handle on what draws these two to each other, what would make Lola disclose that devastating story to Frank after years of telling no one (including family), and what demons would compel Frank to fly across the Atlantic and come on like Charles Bronson in khakis.  When they're together, there's a relaxed, whispery quality to their interactions that's at odds with the mad foolish love so much of the plot seems to require. From a distance, theirs seems like a relationship that might have another six months left in it, the kind of brief but intense extended affair that they'll both fantasize about occasionally, years or even decades later, but without spending too much time wondering what might have been because they already know the answer. There's something missing here, something big, something that would have tied up all the film's finer qualities into a coherent whole. The most frustrating thing about realizing it is that it's impossible to know exactly what could have been done to create the spark this movie needed to combust.  Shannon is, as usual, superb, turning Frank into a believably scruffy neo-noir hero with a rough past: he left home when he was just 16 and has been working in kitchens ever since, and there are intimations of abuse in his past, which partly (if not fully) illuminates his Paris crusade. Poots makes nearly as strong an impression, but unfortunately this is not her movie. Where Frank is allowed a rich interior life and drives much of the action, Lola is primarily his inspiration, the force that compels him to act and react. I would have liked to have seen more exploration of her psyche, with Frank serving as gruff sounding board, and less of the \"Death Wish Lite\" stuff.  Advertisement The supporting cast is filled with ace character actors and rising stars, including Justin Long as a smarmy younger man who says he wants to help Lola with her fashion career and makes that seem like a euphemism. And Ross has a great sense of how to build a scene and let actors carry it, while still paying attention to light and space and never allowing the camera to become a mere recording device. The movie is at its best when jealousy is welling up in Frank, and Lola is feeling a combination of shame and resentment at the notion that she's responsible for his anger. But \"Frank and Lola\" ultimately feels like less of a compelling, free-standing work than a promise of better movies to come.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "True Memoirs of an International Assassin", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "I\u2019ll say this about the latest Netflix Original Comedy, \u201cTrue Memoirs of an International Assassin\u201d: It looks and feels like a real movie. Unlike so many Happy Madison ventures, including Netflix Originals \u201cThe Ridiculous Six\u201d and \u201cThe Do-Over,\u201d this flick has a director who considered visual composition and pacing, and someone actually wrote a screenplay. The script by Jeff Morris, which was on the notorious Black List of the best unproduced screenplays, is surprisingly plot-heavy, something also uncommon for other films starring Kevin James and Adam Sandler, which typically amount to little more than a series of jokes loosely strung together by an unbelievable plot. Ultimately, \u201cTrue Memoirs of an International Assassin\u201d isn\u2019t entertaining enough to recommend, but it\u2019s certainly not the torturous experience of recent James vehicles like \u201cPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2\u201d or \u201cPixels,\u201d and parts of it actually work. Advertisement The star of \u201cThe King of Queens\u201d (an admitted guilty pleasure in reruns for this writer) plays Sam Larson, a cubicle-tethered schlub who has few friends and a horrible boss. He imagines himself the lead of a book he\u2019s writing in his spare time called Memoirs of an International Assassin. Getting advice from a bar mate and former soldier named Amos (Ron Rifkin) about the ins and outs of covert ops, Sam delivers an entertaining, action-packed adventure novel to his new publisher Kylie (Kelen Coleman), who promises \u201cnot to change a word.\u201d She doesn\u2019t. She just adds the word \u201cTrue\u201d to the front of the title, sending Sam\u2019s real life spinning. Now, he\u2019s appearing on talk shows and trying to defend a story of international espionage which he made up. Of course, it\u2019s not long before he\u2019s kidnapped and thrust into the middle of a high-danger situation in Venezuela. The specific details of the international portion of Sam\u2019s adventure are pretty clever in their complexity. Sam first meets El Toro (Andy Garcia), who wants a crime lord named Masovich (Andrew Howard) murdered. Masovich intercepts Sam and orders him to assassinate the President (Kim Coates), who then intercepts Sam and orders him to assassinate El Toro. It's the circle of espionage. Sam, who most people think is the international assassin known as \u201cThe Ghost,\u201d gains a partner in a freedom fighter named Rosa Bolivar (Zulay Henao) and Rob Riggle and Leonard Earl Howze pop up as a couple of U.S. agents who almost watch Sam/Ghost\u2019s current dilemma with skeptical joy. They take wagers as to whether or not he\u2019s actually an assassin and eat popcorn while watching surveillance footage of him trying just to survive. For the most part, \u201cTrue Memoirs of an International Assassin\u201d is just crowded enough to be an entertaining diversion. The problem is that Morris and director Jeff Wadlow go back to the same jokes way too many times\u2014we see multiple scenes of Sam imagining action sequences that don\u2019t really happen and there\u2019s an odd habit in the final act to pepper the soundtrack with Spanish-language versions of American pop songs. The bigger problem is a distinct lack of actual laughs from those jokes, even the first time we hear them. I chuckled once or twice at Riggle & Howze, but it\u2019s tempting to not even categorize the film as a comedy. It\u2019s a melting pot of a diversion, too thin in any specific genre department to really register. It\u2019s not action-packed enough, not funny enough, and the characters aren\u2019t memorable enough. Having said that, it\u2019s never eye-rollingly unfunny, offensive or blatantly stupid. Perhaps this is a low bar to clear, but it\u2019s a time-killer, something that could make a couple hours go by faster if you\u2019re in need of something to speed up the clock. Movies should do more than just kill your time, and this one could have with smarter dialogue and actual characters, but there\u2019s something to be said about a distraction from the international drama of this week, true or not.

Advertisement The best scene in \u201cTriple 9\u201d is arguably its first real\r\nset-piece, the robbery of a downtown Atlanta bank by former special ops\r\nmastermind Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor), dirty cop #1 Marcus Belmont\r\n(Anthony Mackie), dirty cop #2 Jorge Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.), getaway\r\nman Russel Welch (Norman Reedus), and his brother Gabe (Aaron Paul), a\r\ncharacter who might as well being wearing a red shirt and named \u201cFuture\r\nLiability.\u201d Hillcoat and cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis (\u201cThe Drop\u201d)\r\nframe the bank robbery beautifully, taking us from the high-pressure of the\r\nvault to the getaway gone wrong after a red dye pack explodes. It\u2019s tense,\r\nwell-shot and sets up the audience for a high stakes thriller that never comes. It turns out the quintet wasn\u2019t there for the money\u2014they were\r\ntasked with stealing a very specific safety deposit box by Russian mob mastermind\r\nIrina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet), who is now refusing to pay the group until they\r\nperform another job. Irina has control over Michael because Michael has a son\r\nwith Irina\u2019s sister Elena (Gal Gadot) that the Russians are basically holding\r\nhostage, not allowing his father to see him. This plot thread is not only\r\npoorly-developed, it\u2019s a little morally grotesque in that it feels designed to\r\ncreate sympathy for someone who should be a villain, especially when we learn\r\nwhat the title means. If you don\u2019t know, 999 is the code for \u201cofficer down.\u201d In their\r\nplanning of the second heist, which involves a Homeland Security building, the\r\ngroup decides that the best way to distract the rest of the force will be to\r\nkill a cop. As they say, every car responds to a triple nine. And they\u2019ll all be\r\ndistracted enough to not be able to respond to the new heist. Conveniently,\r\nMarcus gets a green new partner in Chris Allen (Casey Affleck). They\u2019ll set up\r\nAllen to get killed, and pull off one final job for Irina while the city is\r\ndescending on the crime scene. They never bother to consider that Allen\u2019s uncle\r\n(Woody Harrelson) is leading the investigation into who they are. Or that the\r\nincreasingly unstable Gabe is a problem. Or that their entire plan is based on a lot\r\nof coincidences and plot holes that we only see in movies. Advertisement Most of \u201cTriple 9\u201d is shot in close-up and near-total\r\ndarkness. Hillcoat and Karakatsanis mistakenly think that this will compensate\r\nfor a lack of character or plot worth caring about. So, we get sweaty, dirty,\r\ngrimy camerawork, under-lit to a nearly-parodic degree, but none of it\r\nresonates beyond showy filmmaking. The film is constantly calling attention to\r\nits visual style (or lack thereof) because there\u2019s so little else on which to\r\nfocus. Despite casting so many talented people, writer Matt Cook and Hillcoat\r\ngive them almost nothing to do. They are cogs in a plot machine with nothing notable\r\nabout their characters or back stories outside of the descriptions you read\r\nabove. Michael has a kid. Gabe is the junkie. Chris is the new guy. That is it. If Hillcoat is trying to say\r\nanything about macho male behavior, the police force, capitalism, or even the\r\nRussian mob, he fails to do so.  The forgettable thinness of the characters is problematic\r\nthroughout but especially in the final act when one realizes you just don\u2019t\r\ncare about these people or what\u2019s going to happen to them. If one subscribes to\r\nthe theory that people can learn as much from a bad movie as from a good one,\r\nwatch the scenes between two of our best actors\u2014Kate Winslet and Chiwetel\r\nEjiofor. Neither have the depth of character or artful purpose that these\r\ntwo have brought to films before. And so their relationship, one of the\r\ndefining ones of the film, has no resonance at all. To be fair, Anthony Mackie\r\nhas so much natural charisma that it shines through every now and then and\r\nCasey Affleck sometimes looks like he\u2019s aware of the better film in which this\r\ncharacter could play a crucial role. It\u2019s also worth noting that when character\r\nhas to take a back seat\u2014in a few action sequences, including a riveting gang shoot-out,\r\nthe movie works. It\u2019s when dialogue and an increasingly-ludicrous plot kicks in\r\nthat the movie fails in head-shaking ways. Every talented cast member will move on from the errors of \u201cTriple\r\n9\u201d and on to bigger and better things. Most of them have already. Follow their\r\nlead.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Raid 2", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "In the 1973 movie \"Sleeper,\" the hapless, frazzled character played by Woody Allen makes a hyperbolic but ineffectual threat to a screaming Diane Keaton: \"If you don't shut up I'm gonna take this rock and bring it down on your head so hard that a substance resembling guacamole is gonna come out of your ears.\" I thought of that line rather often while watching \"The Raid 2,\" in which the cops and criminals doing incessant battle have to go to similar lengths to vanquish, or even just temporarily incapacitate, their foes. With disquieting frequency, a fractured limb, a baseball bat to the cranium, a bisecting slash to the external carotid artery, that sort of thing, simply aren't enough. No, in the world of \"The Raid 2,\" you've got to get your foe on the ground, and bang his (or her!) head against the floor or the pavement until\u2026you know. Only the substance is red so it doesn't really resemble guacamole. In addition, you wanna go for severely dislocated jaws, third degree burns where you least want to see them (I understand this raises the question of where you most want to see them, and that IS deliberate), potential/partial disembowelings, and more.  Advertisement This movie, as its title implies, is a sequel to \"The Raid: Redemption,\" the 2012 Indonesian action film directed by the Welsh-born Gareth Evans, whose cinematic mission in life was, some reports have it, handed down to him when he was first exposed to the Indonesian martial arts. The nearly non-stop action of \"The Raid,\" which is an epic depiction of a drug raid on an apartment block in which hordes of cops and criminals have at each other, is largely martial-arts driven, but with plenty of shooting and slashing, all of it shot in excruciatingly you-are-there close range and edited to both make your head spin and give you whiplash. Action aficionados hailed the movie as some kind of ne plus ultra, and Evans has clearly been eager to answer the fan question \"How is he gonna top THAT?\"  Evans does get around to topping it, with a climactic sequence that's about 45 minutes worth of mayhem that includes a very crunchy car-chase/shootout and a one-on-one battle that destroys a climate-controlled wine room in high style. The plot is both simplicity itself and impossible to follow: Rama, the hero of the first film, is compelled to go undercover to rout both corrupt cops and crime lords and the lethal henchmen of both camps. It's impossible to follow because there are just so damn many crime lords etcetera to keep up with, not that they're all that distinctive. The Fredo-esque son of one crime lord, Uco (Arifin Putra) distinguishes himself with sleek features and a jaded air, both of which genuinely suggest that he'd rather be fronting a Suede tribute band than doing mobster stuff. That's probably not a good thing. I also found that Oka Antara, who plays a stalwart enforcer who's not quite what he seems, gave better action leading man than Iko Uwais, who plays Rama.  None of this much matters of course. What matters is a machete-wielding contract killer, a pair of baddies who kill with baseball equipment and hammers, respectively (the latter character is named \"Hammer Girl,\" say what), and all the sound and fury that is delivered with such a relentlessly straight face and gritted teeth that Tarantino's \"Kill Bill\" pictures look like \"The Gang's All Here\" by comparison. The intensity really falls flat during the scenes in which the action stops and various characters ponder the vicissitudes of loyalty and betrayal and all that. These sequences suggest that the lack of anything BUT action in the first movie was an indication of Evans realizing his limitations.  In any event, nobody's going to mistake these passages for Shakespeare. But the action stuff in \"The Raid 2,\" while likely to alienate the squeamish and summon dark thoughts of cinematic nihilism amongst overthinking highbrows, really IS like nothing else out there. All those looking for a new kick are advised to seek it out, but don't blame me for the headache with which you might leave the theater.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Snowden", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "If Edward Snowden didn\u2019t exist, Oliver Stone might have\r\ninvented him. One can imagine a Stone film about a former employee of the U.S.\r\ngovernment who becomes disillusioned with his country when he learns the depth\r\nof its deceit. In fact, that last sentence could describe a few Stone films,\r\nand so \u201cSnowden\u201d has been widely anticipated as a return to form for the\r\ndirector of masterpieces like \u201cPlatoon,\u201d \u201cJFK\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s his first film in four years and his first with a true story behind it in\r\nalmost a decade (\u201cW.\u201d). Advertisement History will recognize Stone as one of the most\r\nimportant cinematic historians when it comes to the stories of his country,\r\nfrom Vietnam to Richard Nixon to 9/11. And so it makes perfect sense that he\r\nwould be attracted to the story of Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who\r\nrevealed the scope of just how little privacy we have in a post-9/11 world.\r\nStone made the very smart move to hire a committed, underrated actor to play\r\nthe challenging lead role, and the result is a film that thrives off its\r\ncentral performance. Some of the elements around that performance are a bit\r\nlacking, especially the script, but there\u2019s an energy here that Stone hasn\u2019t\r\nhad in a few films, as if he's been enlivened by a subject he was destined to\r\ndocument. \u201cSnowden\u201d actually opens with a scene that will be very\r\nfamiliar to viewers of the Oscar-winning \u201cCitizenfour\u201d\u2014that film\u2019s director,\r\nLaura Poitras (Melissa Leo), and journalist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto)\r\nare going to meet Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who then recounts the last few years of his\r\nlife under extreme cover (cell phones go in the microwave, for example). The\r\nstructure of Kieran Fitzgerald and Stone\u2019s script essentially alternates between\r\nthree stories\u2014the story of Snowden\u2019s discovery of his government\u2019s\r\nhighly intrusive and global surveillance; the story of Snowden\u2019s romance with\r\nLindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley) and how it was impacted by his top-secret jobs;\r\nand the story of the release of what Snowden knew, as documented in \u201cCitizenfour.\u201d\r\nAll three arcs have that \u201cJFK\u201d-esque tendency to have even the smallest roles\r\nfilled by recognizable faces: Rhys Ifans, Tom Wilkinson, Nicolas Cage, Timothy\r\nOlyphant, Joely Richardson, Logan Marshall-Green, Keith Stanfield, Ben Chaplin and more pop up throughout the complex story. And this story is truly complex, especially in the way Stone\r\nand Fitzgerald have chosen to tackle it. They offer a little bit of \u201cthe early days\r\nof Edward,\u201d but it\u2019s not long before Snowden is, shall we say, seeing how the\r\nsausage gets made. For those viewers who have not seen \u201cCitizenfour\u201d or read\r\nmany of the articles written about Snowden, the mid-section of Stone\u2019s\r\nfilm could prove incredibly shocking, and may force a trend of people putting\r\npieces of tape over their laptop camera. That covert operations run by our\r\ngovernment have the capability to turn on your laptop camera without you\r\nknowing it is only one of the revelations here. And as Snowden continues to get\r\ndeeper into the rabbit hole of privacy invasion, Gordon-Levitt\u2019s performance\r\nbecomes more exceptional. At first, it feels like something of an impression\r\n(although a really good one, for the record), but the film works in the way that Gordon-Levitt captures the conflicted inner turmoil of Snowden as the story progresses. He has a remarkable ability to do what so many other actors can\u2019t:\r\nlook at a computer screen and take in its information as if he\u2019s seeing\r\nit for the first time. He grounds a complex story by giving it a very human,\r\nreactive element at its center. Advertisement Stone's film falters with the relationship\r\ndrama involving Snowden and Shailene Woodley's Lindsay Mills. Both actors do their best to make these scenes connect, but\r\nsome moments feel like they came out of another movie and the pair doesn't quite have the right chemistry to make them effective. I understand the\r\nintention\u2014to balance the inordinate number of sequences in front of computer\r\nscreens with a flesh and blood dynamic\u2014but they just don't work, partially due to\r\nflat dialogue but also because they don\u2019t have the energy of the rest of the\r\nfilm. They almost feel like an obligation\u2014a producer\u2019s note to make the film more relatable\u2014but it creates a herky-jerky pace to \u201cSnowden\u201d that keeps it\r\nfrom building steam. I\u2019m sure there were dozens of drafts exploring\r\ndifferent ways to tackle this story, and I'm not convinced they found precisely the\r\nright one. Less relationship drama, and perhaps going chronological from front to back\r\ninstead of using flashback structure, might have helped the rhythm. Despite my issues with the structure of \u201cSnowden,\u201d there are numerous accomplished scenes and the film is carried throughout by\r\nGordon-Levitt. It\u2019s in his body language, which captures a man truly\r\nconflicted about what to do with the information he\u2019s discovered. And that\u2019s an\r\ninteresting approach to the Snowden story in and of itself. In the days\r\nafter the whistleblowing, and even today, many people still want to villainize Snowden as a traitor. It\u2019s not surprising that Stone doesn\u2019t feel\r\nthat way, but what I like about the film is how deeply he works to humanize\r\nsomeone who has become a symbol for US privacy invasion and the need for\r\ntransparency. Working with a very identifiable actor, Stone is careful\r\nto keep this story specific. To be honest, that\u2019s been a gift of his for years,\r\nmaking sure he doesn\u2019t lose the human story of people like Ron Kovic or Jim Garrison\r\nas he\u2019s simultaneously painting a bigger picture. It\u2019s good to have him back at\r\nthe canvas.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Dumb: The Story of Big Brother Magazine", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cDumb: The Story of Big Brother Magazine\u201d is a heartfelt ode to a pioneering magazine in the \u201890s that recognized that skateboarding culture was about much more than just doing tricks or having the coolest art on your board. Built as a counter to traditional skateboard mags like Thrasher, Big Brother gave birth to a gonzo worldview that would eventually lead to the creation of MTV\u2019s\u201cJackass,\u201d which included several of the reporters from the publication and wildly influenced all of pop culture. For a documentary about form-breaking artists, the film is surprisingly straightforward, following a bit too much of a \u201cthen this happened\u201d structure, but there\u2019s an undeniable likability to these memories of barely-contained anarchy that should satisfy both those who remember Big Brother and people who have never heard of it. The film premieres on Hulu tomorrow, June 3rd. Advertisement In much the same way that \u201cDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead\u201d chronicled the rise and fall of National Lampoon through the memories of the key players involved in the magazine, \u201cDumb\u201d charts the history of Big Brother and its \u201chigh-functioning pieces of shit.\u201d At first, Big Brother was a more anarchic alternative to straightforward skateboarding magazines, but then it began to stray from even its base subject matter. As someone says in the doc, \u201cYou can\u2019t write about skateboarding, who gives a fuck?\u201d So, it became a magazine about the culture, mostly joking and playful and risk-taking. Sure, there\u2019d be some cool photos of skateboarders doing tricks but there would also be joke articles like when they took Slayer to Disneyland, covered a skating event by just hanging with a homeless girl nearby, and pulled various pranks on staff members.\u00a0Big Brother also contained copious amounts of two things that its target demo, young men, care deeply about: boobs and drugs. It was the law-breaking elements of Big Brother that would often get it in trouble. They did a spoof of \u201cHow To\u201d articles about how to kill yourself that got some national attention, and even produced a \u201cKids Issue\u201d (note: no apostrophe\u2014not for kids but about kids) that really made people angry as it interviewed skateboarding kids about whether or not they would have sex with their mothers to be better skaters or if they knew what a scrotum was. The interesting thing is that none of these controversies took them down. In fact, Larry Flynt would buy the magazine, and publish it under his label until skateboarding basically became too popular in the \u201800s again for a counter-culture magazine to survive\u2014it was culture-culture.  Patrick O'Dell's film assembles all the major players for a series of interviews, including the main voices behind the magazine like Jeff Tremaine and Chris Pontius, as well as the players who would break off and form \u201cJackass\u201d like Johnny Knoxville and Steve-O, whose first appearance in the magazine included the caption \u201cSteve-O is pathetic,\u201d in a story about him lighting his head on fire. The best of the stories have the feel of a group of friends sitting around at a party, reminiscing about the most memorable moments of their lives over a few beers. It's almost worth watching just for the shattered look on Spike Jonze's face as he speaks about the bit he can never forget: the Poocano. Advertisement Big Brother never made a lot of money\u2014it was losing it before Flynt bought it\u2014but it was formally groundbreaking. I love that the issues would each have a different structure and often a different size in those early days. One even came in a cereal box. That kind of publishing playfulness is gone in an era of YouTube in which everything is delivered in the same format. The best elements of \u201cDumb\u201d get at how these guys weren\u2019t just morons having fun\u2014they were artistic, creative, and funny. Jonah Hill even stops by to give the Big Brother team credit for forming his sense of humor. Having said that, \u201cDumb\u201d is pretty traditional when it comes to form, and it disappointingly rushes through its final chapters, quickly mentioning \u201cJackass\u201d and then the unexpected end of the magazine. I wanted to know more about how the skateboarding culture changed after Big Brother and how we still see its influence in it today, and more about where the key players are now. I guess Big Brother ended with its fans wanting more, but the movie didn\u2019t have to as well.", "Critic": "Beta"}

Mike Cahill, the\r\nwriter/director of \u201cAnother Earth\u201d and \u201cI Origins,\u201d is fascinated with where\r\nthese seemingly diametrically opposed viewpoints conflict or, more\r\ninterestingly, intersect. Can we be scientific and faithful? Can we believe in\r\nforces beyond our control even as we live in a world increasingly fascinated\r\nwith explaining how everything works? With \u201cI Origins,\u201d Cahill takes this\r\ninternal conflict common in so many people and pegs something of a Puzzle Movie\r\non to it as one science-minded man experiences that which he cannot explain\r\nwith traditional reason. It is a film that can sometimes frustrate in its supporting characters\u00a0but Cahill\r\nand his talented cast are unapologetically willing to explore the kind of\r\ncomplex intangibles that filmmakers often ignore or merely turn into\r\npretentious drivel.  Advertisement Dr. Ian Grey (Michael Pitt) is obsessed with the human eye,\r\none of the elements of biology that makes us unique and that religions around\r\nthe world have used as proof of the Divine Creator. We all have eye biometrics\r\nthat are specific to us, and various cultures have viewed the eye as a window\r\nto the soul or even the thumbprint of a creator. Grey wants to get to the\r\nbottom of the evolution of the eye, working with colleagues Kenny (Steven Yeun)\r\nand Karen (Brit Marling). Then he meets a model whose eyes essentially take him\r\nemotional prisoner. At a party, Ian has a sexy encounter with a mostly masked\r\nwoman named Sofi (Astrid Berg\u00e8s-Frisbey) and can\u2019t stop thinking about her. He\r\nfinds himself pushed by fate or destiny to a billboard of her unforgettable\r\neyes, eventually tracking Sofi down and beginning a passionate romance with the\r\nwoman who will change his life. While the preview for \u201cI Origins\u201d gives away\r\nalmost the entire film, we\u2019ll stop the plot synopsis here\u2014it\u2019s better if you\r\ndon\u2019t know much\u2014but Ian\u2019s relationship with Sofi sends him down a very\r\ndifferent path than the scientific one on which he began. \u201cI Origins\u201d is a film\r\nabout how destiny and love can lead us to different revelations than we could\r\nhave possibly reached without them. Anyone who has known love can attest to its\r\nability to forever alter a charted course and Cahill\u2019s emotionally raw approach\r\nto filmmaking gets to the truth of that in a memorable way. It\u2019s also a remarkably confident film technically. Cinema\r\nhas had a love affair with the eye for a century now and Cahill and\r\ncinematographer Markus F\u00f6rderer take the timeless image of the eye and give it\r\nemotional resonance in the way they use it, balancing the film's two equally important halves. Cahill and his technical team\r\nwisely ground their film, only occasionally allowing it flights of visual\r\nfancy. We spend more time with Ian and Karen in a lab than we do in existential\r\npursuit of a greater purpose. And that makes the film\u2019s more extremely philosophical\r\nthemes forgivable. Cahill's work here is a notable technical advancement over \"Another Earth,\" proving he's not just a filmmaker with big ideas but one who can pull them off with visual confidence as well. There's a flow in the cinematography and editing that carries us along, only occasionally becoming untethered to a pretentious degree. Cahill\u2019s smartest move was to not allow his film\u2019s \u201cbig\r\nissues\u201d to overwhelm the human story at its core. And he\u2019s helped notably by\r\nyet-another strong performance from Michael Pitt, an actor who has shown such\r\nrange just recently from his terrifying work on TV's \u201cHannibal\u201d to this relatable,\r\nlikable performance. Advertisement The film's biggest problem is that the two women in Ian\u2019s life aren\u2019t as well-drawn as they\r\ncould have been in a superior film. Sofi and Karen feel a bit too much like\r\nobvious opposites\u2014the \"spiritual model\" and the \"scientific technician.\" If both\r\ncharacters were allowed a bit more of their alternate, \u201cI Origins\u201d would have\r\nbeen a more interesting venture.

{"Title": "Death Note", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "I don\u2019t subscribe to the theory that adaptations of artistically successful source material need remain overly faithful. An adaptation, at its best, should also be an interpretation. It should offer a personal take, a new angle, deepening certain themes while naturally reducing others, etc. However, the decisions made when radically altering source material should feel purposeful, not arbitrary and random. It\u2019s not so much when our favorite books are adapted differently that makes fans angry but when they are lessened by the differences. Such is the case with Adam Wingard\u2019s depressingly awful \u201cDeath Note,\u201d premiering today on Netflix. Several of the changes to Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata\u2019s brilliant manga have already been widely reported, including the whitewashing of the entire project by relocating it from Japan to Seattle, but those are just the symptoms of a greater disease known as complete creative bankruptcy. Advertisement The concept of \u201cDeath Note,\u201d the manga and at least start of the film, is simple. A boy named Light Turner (Nat Wolff) finds a book dropped to Earth by a Shinigami, a Japanese death demon somewhat akin to the Grim Reaper, named Ryuk, voiced in the film by Willem Dafoe. The book says Death Note on the cover and has names written in it over centuries. It also has the rules. Write someone\u2019s name in the book and they will die. In the manga, the rules are extensive and repeated often, but Wingard and writers Charley Parlapanides & Vlas Parlapanides and Jeremy Slater understandably simplify things a bit. In the movie, Light writes a name and a manner of death and it unfolds in front of his eyes. That's about all you need to know. What would you do with that kind of power? In the manga, Light begins testing his own morality by killing criminals, allowing them to die peacefully of heart attacks as he tests the boundaries of playing God. Perhaps recognizing this wouldn\u2019t be thrilling enough for a horror film, the \u201cDeath Note\u201d movie becomes a gorefest almost immediately. Light decides to see if a school bully will truly be decapitated if he writes that on a blank page, and Wingard gleefully stages the ensuing carnage like he\u2019s planning to reboot the \u201cFinal Destination\u201d franchise next. In the film version, Light does move back to \u201cjustified murder,\u201d but even those are Horror Extreme, taking out the man who got away with killing Light\u2019s mother and a criminal holding hostages\u2014both in brutal ways.  The biggest change in the film version of \u201cDeath Note\u201d is the inclusion of a romantic arc with another high school girl named Mia (Margaret Qualley), who is quickly let in on the Angel of Death Game because Light has a crush on her. (One could\u00a0argue that this character is a version of the manga's Misa Amane, an eventual companion for Light in the books but the character's history and purpose are radically different.)\u00a0And the pair soon get a nemesis in the mysterious \u201cL\u201d (Keith Stanfield), who tracks the God of Death known in the press as Kira. One of the best elements of the manga was the cat-and-mouse between Kira/Light and L, but that\u2019s greatly diffused here by the addition of Mia and the changes made to Light\u2019s family, including his police chief father (Shea Whigham).\u00a0 Advertisement And here\u2019s where we get back to the fatal flaw of \u201cDeath Note\u201d: it doesn\u2019t feel like any of these alterations to the source material, and there are many of them, had true artistic or thematic purpose. Why make this or that change? Why add this character or change this plot point? If there\u2019s no true answer, it\u2019s all just a hollow exercise. And the biggest problem is that Wingard and company clearly refused to make Light the antihero he needed to be, and so they add a love interest and pervert the entire concept, leaving the project hollow at its center. Wingard has been a gifted, exciting genre director before with works like \u201cThe Guest\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Next,\u201d but this is misguided in every way. It could be due to years of rewrites of a massive piece of source material, but this movie is a mess on every level, particularly its script.\u00a0The dialogue truly sucks\u2014\u201cWe could change the world.\u201d \u201cWe? As in us?\u201d\u2014but, worst of all, Wingard and his writers never figured out what to do with Ryuk. Yes, a spiky demon voiced by Willem Dafoe is actually boring. Ryuk is a great character, a wisecracking demon who\u2019s fascinated with the flexible morality of human beings. The film version doesn\u2019t know what to do with him, sidelining him until it\u2019s time to turn him into a plot point. Even Ryuk himself looks bored.\u00a0Given the weird bursts of humor and eccentricity in the final project (ex., L\u2019s partner-in-crimesolving Watari sings him \u201cOptimistic Voices\u201d from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to put him to sleep), it\u2019s stunning how few of them come courtesy of Ryuk. In fact, when the oddity of the \u201cL\u201d character is injected into the film (and, to be fair, Stanfield is, as he often is, the best thing about this project) one realizes just how tonally screwed the whole thing is.\u00a0 Most depressingly, given the quality of some of his work (even \"Blair Witch\" has some interesting pieces), the filmmaking here is sporadic, amateurish and haphazard. Wingard verges on black comedy but then pulls back, unsure of what the tone should be of the piece overall. The final scenes are so horrendously constructed and edited that one has to believe the project was rushed or re-shot. And the ending will have you switching off your Netflix app in disgust.

{"Title": "Jason Bourne", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cJason Bourne\u201d may entice ticket buyers with prospects of a creative and adrenalin-pumping reunion between Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass, a duo that went beyond typical blockbuster expectations\r\nwith \u201cThe Bourne Supremacy\u201d and \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum.\u201d Being a fan of both of\r\nthose movies, I too had high hopes for a return to form for the character who\r\nshares a monogram with 007. But it\u2019s mere minutes into \u201cJason Bourne\u201d that something is wrong. Is it the stoic, nearly dialogue-less (25 lines in the\r\nentire film) take on Bourne? Is it the more-hyperactive-than-ever action\r\ncinematography and editing, designed to make every phone call answered and\r\nstrident walk taken seem important?\r\nHow about the familiarity of a plot that literally echoes questions these\r\ncharacters have already asked and answered? \u201cJason Bourne\u201d is a film I kept trying to like. It just wouldn\u2019t let me. Advertisement After learning the truth of his progression from David Webb\r\nto superspy Jason Bourne in the previous two Greengrass films and, of course,\r\nDoug Liman\u2019s \u201cThe Bourne Identity,\u201d JB (Matt Damon) is essentially in hiding.\r\nSure, he pops up for the occasional street fight, but he\u2019s a loner, the kind of\r\nguy with no current attachments, deeply off the grid. (It\u2019s worth\r\nnoting that Greengrass and co-writer Christopher Rouse are just barely\r\ninterested in setting up where Bourne has been and what he\u2019s up to in 2016.) It\u2019s\r\nmere minutes before Nicky (Julia Stiles) drags Bourne back on the radar of\r\nthe nefarious Powers That Be, this time personified by CIA Director Robert\r\nDewey (Tommy Lee Jones). Nicky wants to give Bourne even more of the background\r\nbehind the Treadstone project, particularly the details about what really\r\nhappened to Bourne\u2019s father, Richard Webb (Gregg Henry). Of course, Dewey can\u2019t let that happen, and he plans to use\r\nCIA agent Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) and an assassin known merely as \u201cAsset\u201d\r\n(Vincent Cassel) to keep his undercover dealings undercover. One of the reasons\r\nthat Dewey is particularly panicked about the return of Bourne is that he\u2019s\r\nalso deeply involved with a tech pioneer named Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed,\r\ncurrently seen on HBO's \u201cThe Night Of\u201d), the head of a company called Deep Dream that promises intense levels of privacy to its customers but has been working\r\nwith the CIA in secret. \u201cJason Bourne\u201d includes several of today\u2019s\r\ngreatest hot button concerns\u2014internet privacy, government intrusion\u2014but they feel like window dressing.\u00a0 Matt Damon said in a press conference in 2007 that he thought his\r\niteration of Jason Bourne was over; he had reached the end point of his\r\ncharacter\u2019s journey, his search for his identity. He stated, \u201c\u2026 all of that\r\ninternal propulsive mechanism that drives the character is not there, so if\r\nthere was to be another one then it would have to be a complete\r\nreconfiguration, you know, where do you go from there? For me I kind of feel\r\nlike the story that we set out to tell is has now been told.\u201d He clearly still\r\nfeels that way. Damon can be a complex, character-driven actor with the right\r\nmaterial, but his heart\u2019s not in this. Tommy Lee Jones feels even less invested with the little bit of character he\u2019s been given, and poor Alicia Vikander might as well be named Plot Device in that we know exactly what her\r\narc is going to be from the minute we see her. Perhaps worst of all, Greengrass\r\nfinds a way to waste Vincent Cassel, one of our most physically vibrant and\r\nmenacing actors. Cassel does most of his acting scowling through a sniper scope, and\r\nisn\u2019t allowed to really break out until the end of the film. Only Riz Ahmed makes\r\nany impact on a performance level, doing a lot with very little\u2014watch the way\r\nhe subtly plays a successful businessman who knows the skeletons are about to\r\nfall out of his closet. There's a much better version of \"Jason Bourne\" that focuses on him, contrasting his arc as a man caught up in something greater than himself with our hero's. Advertisement Ahmed registers because one senses an urgency to his character\u2019s plight, which is not the case with the\r\nrest of the film. Rarely has there been so much intensity in the pursuit of a\r\nstory that feels like it has no stakes. When \u201cJason Bourne\u201d is done, ask yourself\r\nwhat everyone was yelling, running and fighting about. Good luck coming up\r\nwith a satisfying answer. It\u2019s as if Greengrass and company knew that they couldn't orchestrate an intriguing new arc for their beloved character, so they just repeated one. The film is like Jason Bourne fan fiction in how much it\r\ncompletely reworks things we\u2019ve seen before, only with a few more years of cyberterrorism\r\nbuzzwords to give viewers the illusion of not just depth but a plot.\u00a0 Even Greengrass\u2019 trademark style feels uninspired. Barry\r\nAckroyd (\u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d) is an undeniably talented cinematographer, but his\r\nstyle doesn\u2019t have the same kinetic energy as Oliver Wood\u2019s work in the\r\noriginal trilogy, which put us right in the middle of the action. It\u2019s a fine\r\nline, but a crucial one; Wood\u2019s camera feels urgent, as if we might get\r\npunched too, whereas Ackroyd\u2019s feels cluttered and desperate. Returning\r\neditor Christopher Rouse (who\u2019s cut all of Greengrass\u2019 films) is the technical\r\nMVP here, giving the film a propulsive energy that could convince some people they\u2019re watching something fun and exciting just by sheer force. However, when\r\nit\u2019s over, even viewers more eager to forgive this failed creative reunion will wonder what it is that they just watched, and what purpose\r\nit serves other than financial. And why no one figured out a new, engaging way\r\nto tell a story that\u2019s already been told.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Phoenix", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "How do we process unimaginable betrayal? How do we overcome\r\nthe kind of events that forever alter the trajectory of a life we so\r\ndesperately want back? These are just two of the questions addressed by\r\nChristian Petzold\u2019s masterful \u201cPhoenix,\u201d a film that firmly cements its\r\ndirector as one of the most impressive working today. With echoes of \u201cVertigo,\u201d\r\nand a deeply confident visual language, Petzold\u2019s film resonates long after its\r\nperfect ending. This is a riveting piece of work that never loses sight of its\r\nhuman story while also serving as a commentary for how an entire country deals\r\nwith tragedies like war. A film this satisfying on every level\u2014one that can be\r\nenjoyed purely for its narrative while also providing material for hours of\r\ndiscussion on its themes\u2014is truly rare.  Advertisement \u201cPhoenix\u201d opens with a face profiled in darkness. It is the\r\nface of Lene (Nina Kunzendorf), a woman driving a bandaged and bloodied\r\npassenger back to Berlin. Her face has been badly damaged, but she is a\r\nsurvivor of a concentration camp. After a brief encounter at a checkpoint, the\r\npair drives further and headlights fill the screen before the title comes up.\r\nThis story will clearly be one of darkness to light, even if it\u2019s a light that\r\nsometimes blinds you. We learn that the passenger is Nelly Lenz (Petzold\u2019s\r\ncollaborator, Nina Hoss), a German-Jewish nightclub singer, who, from the\r\nappearance of photographs and discussions with friend Lene, had a happy life. She\r\nwas married to a handsome, confident man named Johnny (another Petzold regular,\r\nRonald Zehrfeld). On October 4th, Johnny was taken in for\r\nquestioning by the SS. Two days later, he was released, and Nelly was\r\ntransported to a concentration camp. Did Johnny betray his wife\u2019s Jewish\r\nbackground? Clearly. And yet Nelly refuses to believe it. She wants her old\r\nlife back. And that means denial that her husband was and is a self-serving\r\nmonster. After her plastic surgeon advises her that she can look like anyone\r\nand start a new life, she tells him, \u201cI\r\nwant to look exactly like I used to.\u201d She is defiantly, stubbornly in denial\r\nabout what has happened to her. Over Lene\u2019s objections, Nelly returns to Berlin, seeking out\r\nJohnny. She is a shattered woman in a city of rubble. She tells Lene, \u201cI no longer exist.\u201d The relationship,\r\nthe friends she now sees only in pictures, even the city she once lived in\u2014they\u2019re\r\nall gone. She finds some semblance of familiarity in Phoenix, the nightclub\r\nthat literally looks like an oasis in ruins. It\u2019s like a dream that people find\r\namidst the rubble of a bombed-out city. And that\u2019s where she finds Johnny. He\r\ngrabs her one night. He has a plan. He needs someone to pretend to be his dead\r\nwife, so he can claim her inheritance as there\u2019s no evidence that his wife is\r\ndead. \u201cYou have to play my wife.\u201d And\r\nthe parallels between \u201cPhoenix\u201d and \u201cVertigo\u201d come into strong focus as Johnny\r\nbegins to turn this woman he believes is a stranger into the wife he betrayed,\r\nand, in doing so, brings Nelly back to life. Every choice in \u201cPhoenix\u201d has been carefully considered and\r\nyet never in a way that it smothers the realism of the piece. It\u2019s a film that has a deep cinematic language that avoids calling attention to its\r\nstyle. Petzold\u2019s choices are subtle, from the way he frames the expressive\r\nfaces of his actors to the choice of \u201cNight and Day\u201d in a crucial club scene to a climactic conversation that takes place on a train track, so deeply symbolic of looking in one direction to the past and the other to the future (as well as carrying historical weight with the trains that took people like Nelly to concentration camps).\r\nDark and light, rising from the ashes, the overhead lighting or neon red of the\r\nPhoenix sign\u2014Petzold plays so subtly with visual expression of his themes that\r\nhe doesn\u2019t draw attention to them, just allows them to be the background to his\r\nhuman drama.  Advertisement And that human drama is where Nina Hoss takes center stage.\r\nWatch the scene in which she takes off her hat in a club after seeing Johnny\r\nwalk by for the first time. She calls his name, happily, even though she knows\r\nwhat he\u2019s done. It\u2019s a name she\u2019s called so many times before. He looks past\r\nher. Or maybe he looks at her and doesn\u2019t see her. She can\u2019t be there. His\r\nbrain can\u2019t even recognize the possibility that she would be. Hoss puts her\r\nhand to her mouth in horror. It\u2019s not Johnny\u2019s betrayal but Johnny\u2019s dismissal\r\nthat hurts her now. This walking embodiment of when things made sense can\u2019t see\r\nher anymore, and so when he gives her the chance to \u201cbecome Nelly\u201d again, she\r\ntakes it. At one point, Johnny asks Nelly to help craft a story about what he\r\nbelieves is her false narrative of her time in a concentration camp. Of course,\r\nthe story Nelly starts to tell is true. Hoss holds her hands to her face, shaky,\r\nunable to speak fluidly. And Johnny is equally uncomfortable. The fiction he\r\nbelieves he\u2019s creating and the reality they\u2019re both denying are starting to\r\nintersect. Hoss is simply amazing in this scene, and really throughout the film.\r\n To be fair, Zehrfeld is very good as well. Watch a moment in\r\nwhich he comes home to find Nelly in the right dress, made-up, and looking more\r\nlike Nelly of the past. Is that a moment of recognition on his face? Awareness\r\nof what he\u2019s done? No, it can\u2019t be. He can\u2019t be that person and she can\u2019t be\r\nalive. She's a ghost, a reminder of what he's done and what the entire world lost in WWII. If we're lucky, a few times a year we get as complete a package as \u201cPhoenix.\u201d\r\nWe get character studies with performances as strong as Hoss and Zehrfeld are\r\nhere every now and then, or we get auteur-driven films with complex visual choices and an emphasis on\r\nstyle. It\u2019s uncommon to see a film so balanced that it serves as a commentary\r\non the human need to deny war and betrayal while never losing sight of the\r\nstory of a pianist and nightclub singer in 1945 Berlin. \u201cPhoenix\u201d works on so many levels, it's the kind of piece that can be dissected and appreciated for decades. And I expect it will be.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Beguiled", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The women stand on the front steps of a dilapidated Southern plantation house, staring out at the muddy road beyond the gate, a road traversed back and forth by battered Confederate troops, heading towards or away from the fluctuating \"front.\" Outside the gates is all restless movement, inside the gates is stasis. Sofia Coppola's \"The Beguiled\"\u2014a remake (sort of) of the 1971 Don Siegel/Clint Eastwood film\u2014is full of such tableaux. The \"meaning\" is not explicit in the images, although you could read plenty into it if you wanted to (the women are glimpsed between the iron bars of the gate, isolated from the world of men, etc). With its title-card gigantic in a swirling pink font, like a flourishing header in the diary of a melodramatic teenage girl, \"The Beguiled\" is a fairy tale, where beautiful spirited women and girls\u2014flawed and filled with contradictory impulses\u2014are locked away from the larger world (some by choice, others because they have nowhere else to go), and how a man disrupts their quiet; how much turbulence a man can bring. Gorgeously shot by Philippe Le Sourd (in his first collaboration with Coppola), \"The Beguiled\" lingers on its images, allows us time to settle into them. Advertisement The film opens with a haunting sequence where a child of 11 (Oona Laurence) gathers mushrooms in a quiet wood. The air is shattered by distant cannon fire. She then discovers the wounded John McBurney (Colin Farrell), a Union soldier who fled his regiment when the battle was at its height, an unmanly act of which he is ashamed. The child decides to take him back to the girls' school where she lives (\"Any men about?\" McBurney asks her). The school is run by Martha Farnsworth (Nicole Kidman), and there are only 5 students left, as well as the teacher, Edwina (frequent Coppola collaborator Kirsten Dunst). Terrified of \"their\" soldiers discovering their harboring of an enemy, they lock McBurney up in the downstairs music room, and Martha, with a briskness covering up her fluttery reaction to McBurney's presence, tends to his leg wound, bathing him, the scene unfolding in a series of lovingly erotic shots of Farrell's chest, forearms, calves, neck. Meanwhile, all through the house, the students\u2014especially the languid Alicia (Elle Fanning), a teenager but already over-ripened, flushed with need and bored out of her mind\u2014huddle by the door, trying to get at least a brief glimpse of the HUNK lying half-clothed on the fainting couch in the dim interior. Coppola really revels in the humor of the situation, treating it affectionately, the students suddenly appearing with pearl earrings in their ears, or dressing up, or sneaking in to give him gifts. Miss Martha looks at all of this in horror and tries to control the situation. But hormones gonna hormone. (Martha is completely male-phobic in the book. Coppola treats it with a lighter touch.) Thomas Cullinan's 1966 novel (originally titled A Painted Devil) was the basis for the 1971 film, made in the same year as \"Dirty Harry.\" The 1971 film is an entertaining rooster-in-a-henhouse fantasy, wrapped in Southern Gothic histrionics, featuring incest, bed-hopping, amputation, poison, not to mention multiple shots of Eastwood's smooth exposed chest. Director Don Siegel said the film was about \"the basic desire of women to castrate men,\" a pretty clear expression of male anxiety in that particular era. Coppola's adaptation removes quite a bit from the original source material as well as from the earlier film (there's been a lot of controversy about her editing out Matilda, the slave who works at the school, but the absence of the incest sub-plot is even more radical, considering what a large role it plays in the original story.) In the multi-narrator book, Edwina, who forms a special bond with McBurney (the problem is, he forms a special bond with each of them), muses: \"Each rumble of the cannons, each swirl of smoke, was a sign of great trouble ... spreading like ripples in a stream to villages and towns and solitary lonely houses all over the land. Perhaps the trouble of the wounded boy would spread and infect people far away from here.\" Advertisement McBurney symbolizes a different thing to each one of them, and he's a shape-shifter, sometimes friendly, or flirty, sometimes polite, sometimes earnest. Farrell, a gifted and fluid actor, is perfect for this role, and it's difficult to imagine another actor pulling it off. You can't manufacture charm like that. Kidman and Durst are both funny and intense, tag-teaming Martha's steel-magnolia energy with Edwina's ladylike delicacy. Fanning, one of the best young actresses working today, is teenage yearning in the flesh, her lazy gestures suggesting restlessness bordering on explosion. The film suffers a bit from the absence of melodrama (particularly in the case of Martha's backstory), but if you didn't know the original or if you hadn't read the book then that might not matter. This is Coppola's film with Coppola's fingerprint. She is interested in the fleeting, in things not easily said, and here she is interested in the ridiculousness of repressing the sex drive (at one point, Edwina is so turned on she almost collapses against a wall). The film is about that house, the pewter-toned light inside, the way the sunset catches the tops of the columns, the women floating through the overgrown yard, the younger girls lying in the same bed, limbs intertwined, practically a Coppola signature at this point. The interior is the female realm, where women dominate and the male lies in repose, to be gawked at and fussed over. The women are powerful and resourceful (\"Edwina, bring me the anatomy book\") but ready to tear each other apart to get to that man in the room. Coppola is not all that interested in explicit commentary or contextualizing larger issues; her interests lie in the peripheral; in what happens when things get quiet; in the way bodies arrange themselves in the frame. You can see it in all of her films. The teenage girl sneaking a peek at V.C. Andrews' \"Flowers in the Attic,\" propped on her slender thighs in \"Lick the Star,\" Coppola's first short film. The five blonde sisters flopped in a pigpile of long limbs and long hair in \"The Virgin Suicides.\" The young woman curled up on the windowsill in her hotel room, her body floating over the cityscape below in \"Lost in Translation.\" The identical strippers in \"Somewhere\" twirling around poles, their bodies undulating in a surreal and almost serene beauty. The teenage burglar in \"The Bling Ring\" dabbing her throat with perfume, staring at her reflection in a trance so deep it is disconnected from reality. These moments don't \"lead anywhere,\" but still, they have enormous resonance. You can't write a thesis statement about what \"The Beguiled\" is about. It's not that kind of movie. But it's the kind of movie that lingers on in your head, just like the best fairy tales do. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
