{"Title": "The Vault", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "On one of the worst moviegoing weekends of the year\u2014go check out our reviews of \u201cJackals,\u201d \u201cTemple,\u201d and \u201cGoon: Last of the Enforcers\u201d for just a taste of the awful\u2014it was even more disconcerting than usual to hear that \"The Vault\" wouldn\u2019t be made available early for reviews. Yes, there are films that screen for critics that end up being surprisingly solid\u2014maybe the studio just doesn\u2019t have the confidence they should in it\u2014but it\u2019s more often that they\u2019re trying to hide a piece of junk. So, while I desperately try to approach each film with as much optimism as possible, it was difficult when I sat down to watch \u201cThe Vault\u201d to not be a little concerned. Much to my surprise, this genre hybrid has its moments\u2014way more than several of the films this week being made widely available to critics. It won\u2019t change your life, but it won\u2019t make you angry either. Labor Day weekend for a limited and VOD release? That\u2019s almost a positive review. Advertisement Sadly, \u201calmost\u201d is as good as I can get for \u201cThe Vault,\u201d a film that merges the bank robbery flick with a haunted house movie. Yes, it\u2019s \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d meets \u201cThe Haunting.\u201d And while that\u2019s an undeniably fun idea, director Dan Bush (\u201cThe Signal\u201d) doesn\u2019t quite know how to pull off either half. Both the heist movie and the spooky flick are underdeveloped with the former lacking the intense dedication to geography that puts you in the middle of the scene and the latter resorting too often to jump scares and undefined rules of the game. And then there\u2019s the ending, which is so resolutely stupid that I suspect the few people who do see this in theaters this weekend will throw their remaining popcorn at the screen. Co-written by Bush and Conal Byrne, \u201cThe Vault\u201d is a (mostly) single-setting affair at what looks like a relatively ordinary bank on what seems like a relatively ordinary morning. A young woman named Leah (Francesca Eastwood, Clint\u2019s daughter) is applying for a job as a teller; another woman named Vee (Taryn Manning) is complaining about checks that shouldn\u2019t have bounced; a local cop (Clifton Collins, Jr.) is flirting with another teller named Susan (Q\u2019orianka Kilcher). There\u2019s a lot of noise coming from outside from a fire down the street, and a trio of firemen enter the bank to make sure it\u2019s secure as well\u2014and then they\u2019re revealed to be robbers, working in conjunction with Leah and Vee. In fact, the two ladies are sisters, backing up their brother, the head fireman/robber Michael (Scott Haze), who needs some cash to get out of a really bad situation. They\u2019re not gonna hurt anyone. They\u2019ll just take what they need and leave. The problems start when the siblings discover that there\u2019s not much money in this small bank\u2014only about $70k. That\u2019s when another employee named Ed (James Franco) steps in to tell them a secret\u2014there\u2019s a second vault in the basement, and that one\u2019s got millions in it. Of course, there\u2019s a reason no one goes in the basement vault, and the robbers release something ancient and evil when they break into it. Before you know it, people are seeing shapes that don\u2019t show up on the security cameras and doing awfully gory things to themselves. Now, the robbers and employees have to escape something much worse than a federal crime. Advertisement Eastwood is a charismatic lead, and the rest of the supporting cast is adequate, but Bush can\u2019t quite figure out what movie he\u2019s making. He needed to co-write and direct a bank robbery film that worked on its own terms, without the hulking ghosts in the basement, but we know that\u2019s not this movie, and so the first act is something of a dull waiting game, waiting for the carnage to kick in. Once it does, I was surprised at how much the leads worked to keep the silliness from verging into camp. Eastwood, Kilcher and Haze sell the confusion and fear of their predicament. And while Franco looks bored too often, his is a smaller role than the poster would have you believe.  Ultimately, \u201cThe Vault\u201d isn\u2019t silly enough to be horrendously memorable or tense enough to be effective as the genre exercise it could have been. It falls into that underdeveloped gap in the middle. Maybe that\u2019s why the studio hid it from critics. It wasn\u2019t that it was awful, it was that they forgot they were releasing it.", "Critic": "Beta"}
