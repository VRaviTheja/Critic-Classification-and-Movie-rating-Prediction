{"Title": "Seymour: An Introduction", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The title of the new documentary directed by and featuring\r\nEthan Hawke provides a vague indication of the work\u2019s eventual assets and\r\nliabilities. On one level, the title is straightforward: the movie does\r\nintroduce viewers to Seymour Bernstein, a classical pianist in his 80s who, at\r\nthe midpoint of his life, gave up public performances and became a teacher of\r\npiano instead. Then there\u2019s the allusion to J.D. Salinger\u2019s novella, an account\r\nof the precocious genius of the Glass family, by now something of an American\r\nliterary legend. Although the evocation of Salinger and his creation evokes\r\nintriguing associations of reclusiveness and talent and all that, in the end\r\nthere\u2019s not much here to do with Salinger or his character: the title plays on\r\na coincidence, and is in a sense a bit cute and/or pretentious (my own\r\npreferred term is \u201cknow-somethingish\u201d).\u00a0 Advertisement Hawke might have more appropriately called\r\nhis short feature \u201cSeymour: An Interrogation,\u201d because while the film lays out\r\nBernstein\u2019s life story and his perceptions on art, and explores his talent,\r\nHawke makes clear from the outset that he chose Bernstein as a subject (the two\r\nmet when seated next to each other at a dinner party) in order to explore\r\nquestions hyphenate Hawke (the \u201cBoyhood\u201d and \u201cTraining Day\u201d co-star has accrued\r\nnot just several directorial credits but is a published author as well) has\r\nabout his own artistic practice. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was authentic,\u201d Hawke\r\nadmits of his own work in an early conversation with Bernstein. He apparently\r\nsees something very authentic in his subject.  In limning the world of classical music during the period in\r\nwhich Bernstein practiced, then abandoned, performance, Hawke gives viewers the\r\npicture of a very different New York City than exists today: a Manhattan, or\r\nat least a pocket of Manhattan, both aesthetically refined and at least mildly\r\naffluent. In a caf\u00e9, Bernstein reminisces with an adult former student who\r\nneglected his lessons to the extent that he became \u201cincorrigible;\u201d this\r\nwell-heeled fellow is Michael Kimmelman, now an art critic for \u201cThe New York\r\nTimes.\u201d\u00a0 Throughout the picture, Bernstein interacts with genteel folk who\r\nquietly deplore what they see as the American perception of art and\r\nart-making\u2014\u201cthey want the \u2018Flashdance\u2019 fallacy,\u201d one sighs, alluding to a\r\ntalent that flies out of a bottle like a genie with no craft or labor involved.\r\nIn between these exchanges, Bernstein works with young students, counting out\r\nmeasures, contemplating accents, working out the problem of how to get one\u2019s\r\npinkie to just this particular distant piano key in time to make the musical\r\nphrase coherent. Like Jody Lee Lipes\u2019 recent documentary \u201cBallet 422,\u201d Hawke\u2019s\r\nmovie patiently demonstrates that Art Needs Work. But it also needs philosophy,\r\nand Hawke, while never so louche as to just up and ask the reason Bernstein\r\ngave up the limelight to impart his wisdom to others instead, prods the ways\r\nBernstein\u2019s struggles to be a great performer abraded his desire to be a decent\r\nhuman being.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cJackson Pollock and\u2026Marlon Brando were all pretty notoriously\r\nhorrible people,\" Hawke suggests to\r\nBernstein at one point. \u201cThey were. And there are musicians who were monsters,\u201d\r\nBernstein responds. \u201cGlenn Gould, for example,\u201d Hawke offers. Bernstein takes\r\nthe bait, and offers up some spicy Gould dish. For Bernstein, the tragedy of\r\nGould\u2019s approach is that he\u2019s only able to hear Gould\u2019s playing: \u201cI don\u2019t hear\r\nBach,\u201d Bernstein says. Hawke lets it lay, not pursuing the question of whether\r\nthere\u2019s any value in hearing Gould qua Gould. Also curious is, given how one of\r\nthe film\u2019s threads seems to deplore the trappings of fame and acclaim him,\r\nBernstein\u2019s pleasure in having apparently played a small part in gaining a\r\nknighthood for the British pianist Clifford Curzon.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think the\r\ncontradictions implied here can\u2019t be resolved or at least fruitfully explored;\r\nit\u2019s that Hawke doesn\u2019t seem to think so. So the movie kind of flits along\u2014if\r\none wanted to be cruel one would use a word like \u201cdilettante\u201d\u2014pleasantly and\r\ninformatively enough without ever lifting off. Until the last fifteen minutes\r\nor so, in which Bernstein, having been convinced to play a semi-private recital\r\nfor Hawke\u2019s theater company, performs and discusses Schumann\u2019s \u201cFantasia.\u201d\r\nHawke, in a rather disarming display of cinematic virtuosity, cuts from\r\nBernstein playing the piece, Bernstein directly addressing the camera,\r\nBernstein directly addressing a live audience, keeping the music on a through\r\nline for the most part as Bernstein lays out its history and its significance\r\nfor both himself and music itself. A prior pronouncement by mystic Andrew\r\nHarvey, \u201cI had an experience of music creating the whole universe,\u201d suddenly\r\nseems a little less dippy. The effect of the sequence is both pedagogically\r\nrewarding and aesthetically transportive. It lifts the movie into a higher\r\nrealm.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
