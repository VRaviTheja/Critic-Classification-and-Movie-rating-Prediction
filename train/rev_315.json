{"Title": "Complete Unknown", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cComplete Unknown\u201d has a killer opening sequence. Two young\r\nwomen, their faces tantalizingly kept out of frame much of the time, discuss a\r\nnew living arrangement for one of the women, who\u2019s back from a long time away,\r\nin an exotic location, where, she says, she worked with some \u201camazing\r\nbotanists.\u201d That woman, glimpsed in profile, is recognizable as Rachel Weisz.\r\nSo, too, is the compassionate and competent hospital nurse seen in a couple of\r\nfollowing shots. So, too, is the magician\u2019s assistant working in a Chinese\r\nnightclub in the next few shots. So, too, is the somberly dressed woman sitting\r\nin a car parked outside of a suburban house, watching as an older woman drives\r\nher car out of the driveway and away from that house. Is this a woman with a\r\nlot of careers? Is this a clone? Advertisement Next we\u2019re in a New York office and characters Tom (Michael\r\nShannon) and Clyde (Michael Chernus) are discussing a matter of some import;\r\nTom is drafting a sort of codicil to a piece of proposed legislation, and is\r\nconcerned about \u201cfall grazing trends,\u201d and because he\u2019s Michael Shannon, his\r\nconcern is pretty intense. In short order, Weisz\u2019s character is seen doing\r\nonline research about the sandy-haired, goateed, slightly pudgy Clyde, and\r\ninsinuating herself into his attentions by way of an obviously engineered\r\nmeet-cute in Clyde\u2019s office cafeteria. The viewer will have more questions now:\r\nis Weisz someone who engages in some sort of corporate espionage, hence all of\r\nher personae?\u00a0 The answers are not too long in coming, and without giving too\r\nmuch away, \u201cComplete Unknown\u201d unspools as more of a chamber drama than a\r\nthriller. The picture is co-written and directed by Joshua Marston, who\u2019s\r\nworked a lot in television in recent years but whose feature film career has a\r\ndistinguishing characteristic which is defined by the fact that this picture is\r\nthe California-born filmmaker\u2019s first full-length movie in English. His 2004\r\nfeature debut \u201cMaria Full of Grace\u201d was mostly in Spanish, and 2011\u2019s striking,\r\nunderseen \u201cThe Forgiveness of Blood\u201d was set and shot in Albania. The milieu of\r\n\u201cComplete Unknown\u201d has an internationalist bent; Tom\u2019s wife, Ramina (Azita Ghanizada), is\r\nPersian, and is informally tutoring Tom in Farsi; everyone in Tom\u2019s circle is\r\nwell-traveled, as is \u201cAlice,\u201d who comes to Tom\u2019s birthday party as Clyde\u2019s\r\nplatonic date. This new persona of Weisz\u2019s claims to have just come in from\r\nTasmania, where she\u2019s been working with a newly discovered species of toad.\r\nTom, however, recognizes someone wholly other in Alice.  At a certain point, the character Weisz plays reminded me of\r\na less score-settling version of, well, Alice, the persona-shifting sometime\r\nstripper from Mike Nichols\u2019 2004 \u201cCloser,\u201d adapted by Patrick Marber from his\r\nplay. As Tom and \u201cAlice\u201d separate themselves from Tom\u2019s social circle to sort\r\nthings out, Weisz\u2019s character explains to Tom that the way she morphs from\r\nperson to person has been a liberation for her: \u201cI could be anyone I wanted.\u201d A\r\nchance encounter on the street with an older woman walking her dog (Kathy\r\nBates) ends in a mishap that compels Tom and Alice to escort the woman back to\r\nher home, where they meet her husband (Danny Glover). There, \u201cAlice\u201d gives Tom\r\nan object lesson in impersonation by passing him off to the couple as an\r\nosteopath, and he performs a credible diagnosis on Bates\u2019 character in a sequence that\u2019s both suspenseful and\r\nmordantly funny, one that is brought off beautifully by the four expert actors.\u00a0 Advertisement Marston\u2019s screenplay, co-written with Julian Sheppard, is sharp and has a nice\r\nnumber of twists. His directing style here is intriguing. Shooting in\r\nwidescreen, he often maintains an almost claustrophobically shallow focus, and\r\nplaces what would customarily be crucial points of interest near the edge of\r\nthe frame. It\u2019s a good strategy for keeping the viewer a little off balance.\r\nAnd a tight frame also has the added benefit of masking a tight budget,\r\nalthough to tell the truth I did notice when the golden retriever that Bates\u2019\r\ncharacter was walking completely\r\nvanished as soon as Bates, Weisz and Shannon entered the Bates\u2019 character\u2019s\r\napartment building. The movie does pretty well as a treatment of identity and\r\nselfhood in a social landscape that grows increasingly alienating as it becomes more transparent. But it somehow\r\nfails to wholly satisfy. And as killer\r\nas the opening sequence is, the movie\u2019 final shot is a disquieting dud: it is practically (color values aside) a\r\nreplica of the final shot of the aforementioned \u201cCloser.\u201d Which is not to say\r\nthat Marston lifted it; for all I know he\u2019s never even seen the movie. It\u2019s\r\nmore likely that the observation that motivated the shot was exactly the same,\r\nwhich leads me to question the ultimate value of the sentiment.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
