{"Title": "The Post", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cWe have to be the check on their power. We don\u2019t hold them accountable, my God, who will?\u201d Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cThe Post,\u201d rushed into production on a turnaround time that only Ridley Scott could possibly match, may be the story of a challenge to the free press in 1971 but lines like that solidify how much it\u2019s intended to also be read as a mirror of 2017. As the President of the United States challenges different journalistic institutions, mostly through his Twitter feed, and \u201ctruth\u201d seems to have become a looser term than ever before, \u201cThe Post\u201d is designed to be viewed as a commentary on today as much as yesterday, maybe even more. It\u2019s fascinating to consider a film this well-constructed and packed with talented performers that would have played completely differently just two years ago. However, I wonder if hurrying the movie\u00a0to strike a moment\u00a0was the right decision.\u00a0It's a film that\u00a0often calls attention to its own self-importance and falters when compared to Spielberg\u2019s best historical dramas like \u201cMunich\u201d and \u201cLincoln,\u201d movies that earn their messages instead of just stating them.\u00a0One can almost see the weight on its shoulders to \u201csay something important,\u201d and it sometimes drags down the entire venture. However, there\u2019s more than enough to like here, including a great ensemble, the best performance from a living legend in years, and, again, a message that feels depressingly timely. Advertisement \u201cThe Post\u201d tells the story of the Pentagon Papers, choosing to focus\u00a0on two key players in the unfolding battle between the free press and a White House that struggled to keep the secrets of how our government handled the Vietnam War under wraps. As Fritz Beebe (Tracy Letts, continuing his amazing 2017) says at one point, this was the first time that the court system of our government basically tried to stop the function of the free press.    It started when Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) walked away with thousands of pages on the history of Vietnam, including sensitive and confidential information that revealed the lies the government had told the American people for years. To sum it up superficially with a line from the movie, \u201cMcNamara knew we couldn\u2019t win in \u201965.\u201d Six years later, with thousands of deaths on their hands, the truth was revealed, first in the\u00a0New York Times. The courts ruled that the Times couldn\u2019t publish any more of the documents or what they learned from them, but the\u00a0Washington Post found their way into the story as well with Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk) getting to the same source as his competition. Suddenly, the Post was sitting on hundreds of pages of sensitive documents that the courts had ruled couldn\u2019t be published. If they ran a story, not only could they go out of business, they could literally be arrested for treason. What would you do?    The two central figures of this story are Kay Graham (Meryl Streep), the beleaguered publisher of the Post, doing a good job that too many men around her consider her incapable of doing, and Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), the editor of the Post, and the man who never questions whether of not they should publish. In casting alone, Spielberg makes clear his opinion of Graham and Bradlee, filling their shoes with two of the most beloved actors of all time. And they both deliver for their director, particularly Streep, who hasn\u2019t given a performance this nuanced in a very long time\u2014reminding one what she can do when she\u2019s paired with the right collaborator (my biggest problem with Streep\u2019s \u201800s and \u201810s work is how rarely she works with directors who challenge her). Hanks finds the right degree of gravity for Bradlee as well, although both occasionally slip up due to a script that too often calls attention to itself. This story should be about Graham\u2019s fear that she may make the wrong decision\u2014for her business or for the state of journalism as a whole\u2014but the stakes don\u2019t always feel right. We never really question what anyone is going to do in \u201cThe Post,\" especially given how well-reported this story has been. (Although even if you know none of this story, there's a distinct lack of suspense.) And to make up for that lack of actual tension, co-writers Liz Hannah and Josh Singer sprinkle in heavy doses of the kind of things people only say in movies (\u201cJefferson just rolled over in his grave,\u201d for example). I often wanted a more tactile, dirtier version of \u201cThe Post,\u201d one that didn\u2019t feel like it was taking place in a Hollywood vacuum. Bob Odenkirk almost steals the movie just by seeming the least like a mouthpiece.    However, the truth is that every time \u201cThe Post\u201d threatens to slide into pure, pretentious melodrama, the talent of someone involved pulls it out. Whether it\u2019s a subtle choice made by Streep or Hanks, an economy of storytelling displayed by Spielberg, a composition by John Williams\u2014there\u2019s always something to hold on to in \u201cThe Post\u201d that keeps it working. Even the sound design\u2014a symphony of typewriter clicking and ringing phones singing out through the Post offices\u2014is engaging. It\u2019s a movie from one of our most essential filmmakers when it comes to pure entertainment, and it works on that level. Even just the parade of familiar faces (I didn\u2019t even mention the always-welcome presences of Carrie Coon, David Cross, Sarah Paulson, or Pat Healy) will keep you engaged.    Advertisement Will that engagement continue after the journalistic tumult of the Trump administration? If we\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s that challenges to the free press will always persist, and so there are almost certainly lessons for future generations in \u201cThe Post.\u201d Will it hold up as cinema outside of its cultural moment? On the one hand, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Despite what people want to argue in comments sections, film doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, it often responds to and plays differently because of current events. And so while I\u2019m curious to see how people remember \u201cThe Post\u201d in ten years, we can only respond to it today, as institutions like the newspaper at its center are yet again under attack. Where are the Kay Grahams and Ben Bradlees of today? While I wish \u201cThe Post\u201d asked this question more directly and angrily, there\u2019s definite value in people this prominent\u00a0asking it at all.", "Critic": "Beta"}
