{"Title": "Young Ones", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "I don\u2019t want to come off like some kind of inverse snob, but\r\nI\u2019ve got to say, given the circumstances of his birth and upbringing,\r\nwriter-director Jake Paltrow strikes me as the Least Qualified Person To\r\nEnvision A Dystopian Sci-Fi Future Ever. You may infer the circumstances of\r\nPaltrow\u2019s birth and upbringing by his name, I reckon. In any event,\r\nqualifications notwithstanding, he has nevertheless opted to imagine and film\r\nsuch a story, one that bears out my hunch.  \u201cYoung Ones\u201d (there really isn\u2019t anything in the movie that\r\nmakes this bland title pop) takes place in an unnamed portion of the Western\r\nUnited States at a time when water is very scarce, and chronicles a sort of\r\nland-war-by-subterfuge in which the main players are Michael Shannon\u2019s haunted\r\npatriarch, Nicholas Hoult\u2019s ambitious young-man-on-the-make (for several items,\r\nincluding Elle Fanning\u2019s character, Shannon\u2019s daughter) and Kodi Smit-McPhee\u2019s\r\nobservant, sensitive son-of-Shannon. In Paltrow\u2019s future, water is a commodity\r\nnot unlike oil. But the former farmers of the now-desert in which Shannon\r\nroams, first with a live donkey, then with a robot replacement, are not nearly\r\nas stressed as ordinary mortals in danger of imminent dehydration might be in\r\nthe real world. Indeed, Paltrow\u2019s near-dystopia (there is still a central\r\ngovernment and a semblance of civilization, including used-car dealerships, in this\r\nworld) is one of the most decorous you\u2019ll ever see. Even the most thirsty and\r\ndesperate look pretty good most of the time. And the color coordination! At one\r\npoint, Aimee Mullins, playing a mom with a new robotic spinal cord, tunes into a\r\nvideo-streaming funeral, at which the attendees are all dressed in blue-grey\r\nclothes, the better to blend in with the blue-grey rock formation behind them.\r\nSeriously, this movie makes \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d look like \u201cThe Road Warrior.\u201d  Advertisement Paltrow, whose previous directorial feature was the somewhat\r\nmore apt 2007 showbiz romcom \u201cThe Good Night,\u201d is an attentive student of\r\ncinema, as his mini-homages to the likes of Antonioni and Lucas in this story\r\ntestify. But his story is a veritable nothingburger, here and there recalling notes\r\nfrom the likes of \u201cGiant\u201d and \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d but never really\r\nconnecting on levels emotional or intellectual. One would like to say the cast\r\ndoes its level best, but, to be brutally honest, the footage assembled doesn\u2019t\r\ndepict them doing a whole lot more than squinting, and looking lanky in clothes\r\nthat, again, aren\u2019t inordinately suitable for desert living, unless it\u2019s GQ\u2019s\r\nidea of desert living. Viewers who make it to the end will be confused or\r\ninfuriated but likely not delighted by the faux-Wes-Anderson curtain-call end\r\ncredits. Too bland to qualify as a really notable disaster, \u201cYoung Ones\u201d finds\r\nyoung Paltrow still trying to find his voice. If he intends to continue on this\r\ncareer path, he\u2019d best accelerate a bit, as he\u2019s almost 40.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
