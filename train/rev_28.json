{"Title": "Playing It Cool", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Films about writers are tough enough. Films about writers\r\nwho think they\u2019re the smartest person in the room and too cool for the love story\r\nin which they\u2019re essentially starring are even more ill-advised. Such is one of\r\nthe many problems with \u201cPlaying It Cool\u201d, a movie that suffers greatly from its\r\ntendency to constantly remind you that \u201cThis is a Film About WRITERS.\u201d Our narrator\r\nnot only comments on the action of the piece incessantly, he\u2019s credited as \u201cMe\u201d.\r\nAnd the narcissism doesn\u2019t stop there. This \u201cMe\u201d constantly reminds us about\r\nhow differently writers see the world, how idiosyncratic they are, how smart\r\nthey are, how much better they are than you, etc. It\u2019s like being stuck in the head of a Creative Writing student who looks down on everyone else's major.\r\nAnd the film ultimately falls victim to the false assumption that highlighting clich\u00e9s\r\nmakes them easier to bear, when, in fact, I find the opposite true. Embrace\r\nyour manipulation, don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re above it before you use it. Only the\r\nreally strong cast, including great chemistry between the leads, keeps \u201cPlaying\r\nIt Cool\u201d from totally derailing. Advertisement Chris Evans plays the narrator, a lovelorn, one-night stand\r\ntype whose mom left him years ago with a note on the Cap\u2019n Crunch and whose\r\nheart isn\u2019t just on his sleeve, it\u2019s taken form and follows him around,\r\nchain-smoking. Then, of course, he gets smacked in the face with love when he\r\nmeets \u201cHer,\u201d played by the lovely Michelle Monaghan. It wouldn\u2019t be a movie if\r\nour object of desire was single, and so we get an uptight beau named \u201cStuffy\u201d\r\n(Ioan Gruffudd) to eventually overcome. More problematic for our hero is the\r\nfact that he doesn\u2019t really believe in the love in which he\u2019s falling. He talks\r\nthrough his concerns with writer friends Scott (Topher Grace), Lyle (Martin\r\nStarr), Mallory (Aubrey Plaza), and Samson (Luke Wilson)\u2014a group of characters\r\nso poorly realized that I started to wonder if they weren\u2019t all figments of our\r\nwriter\u2019s imagination.  \u201cPlaying It Cool\u201d is so self-consciously trying to convince\r\nviewers that it\u2019s the smartest romantic comedy in years that it never bothers\r\nto create characters. I\u2019m sure writer/director Justin Reardon thought he was\r\nbeing clever in his construction (unnamed characters who constantly comment on\r\ntheir own clich\u00e9d situations) but the result is an annoyingly pretentious piece\r\nof work. There\u2019s more \u201ccommentary\u201d about writing and love in \u201cPlaying It Cool\u201d\r\nthan actual romance or friendship. It defiantly fails the \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d\r\nargument. It is all telling. Which adds to how remarkable it is that Evans and Monaghan\r\nkeep the film from becoming totally unbearable. He\u2019s likely to always be most\r\nfamous for Captain America, but I\u2019ve always found him a likable actor\u2014believable,\r\ncharismatic, smart. Evans is up for anything. It\u2019s Reardon\u2019s fault that he\r\ndoesn\u2019t give him anything consistent to do. Evans\u2019 writer is a total narcissist\u2014he\r\nliterally puts himself in the leading roles of every story his writer friends tell\r\nhim. Lovely, right? And yet Evans is too likable to make this guy the total\r\nasshole he probably would be in real life. Similarly, while we never quite\r\nunderstand what Monaghan would see in him besides the physical, she\u2019s a typical\r\ndelight. She\u2019s another actress I\u2019d love to see get better work. Maybe they\r\nshould both stay away from films about writers. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
