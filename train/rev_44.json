{"Title": "The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "For \u201cThe Kingdom of Dreams and Madness,\u201d director Mami\r\nSunada was allowed remarkable access to one of the most important artistic\r\nenterprises of the last half-century, Studio Ghibli, at a unique point in\r\nits existence. News about the shuttering of the company that has given the\r\nworld masterpieces like \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d and \u201cSpirited Away\u201d reverberated\r\nthroughout the animation community and beyond earlier this year. And there\u2019s a\r\nsense in \u201cKingdom\" that this is an elegy of sorts, a goodbye to an era of\r\nremarkable creative resonance. The cinematic visions that emerged from the\r\ndrawing tables of this relatively nondescript building have influenced\r\ncountless creative voices, and will continue to do so for the rest of time. To\r\nsay I\u2019m a Ghibli fan would be something of an understatement (my \u201cTotoro\u201d\r\niPhone case had to be internationally ordered, for the record), and so \u201cKingdom\u201d\r\nnaturally speaks to my interests. If you\u2019re not enraptured with the work of\r\nHayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and the rest of the artists at Ghibli, it may not\r\nbe precisely what you\u2019re looking for, but Sanada captures something poetic\r\nabout art and creativity that could speak to anyone, animation fan or\r\notherwise. Advertisement Having said that, it\u2019s very helpful to have seen \u201cThe Wind\r\nRises\u201d and \u201cThe Tale of the Princess Kaguya,\u201d the two most recent Ghibli films,\r\nand the two pieces being worked on for the year Sanada had access to the\r\nstudio. Just the very idea that two such massive productions from two masters\r\nof the form were being produced simultaneously seems to cause ulcers in several\r\nproducers involved. And yet Miyazaki\u2019s process has been the same for decades.\r\nHe works from 11am-9pm every day, on the dot. He doesn\u2019t write scripts, he\r\nwrites storyboards, and his assistants begin production from those drawings\r\nbefore he\u2019s done, unsure of how the film will end. Miyazaki is very open with\r\nhis process, opening his studio and home to Sanada, and philosophizing on art\r\nand humanity in ways that feel like someone coming to terms with a life\u2019s work.\r\nHe speaks candidly about how he makes films for others, most notably the people\r\nat Ghibli, and yet there\u2019s something so deeply personal about \u201cThe Wind Rises\u201d\r\nthat it\u2019s the first film that makes him cry after its premiere screening. He\r\nshares the \u201cbeautiful but cursed dreams\u201d of its protagonist. \u201cThe Kingdom of Dreams and Madness\u201d contains surprisingly\r\nlittle actual film footage. There are more shots of Miyazaki's cat than his films. We see bits and pieces of \u201cWind Rises\u201d as it\u2019s\r\nbeing assembled, but this is more a \u201cyear in the life\u201d documentary than a\r\nhistory of the studio, although there are bits and pieces of the latter. Sanada\u2019s\r\nfilm is at its best when the director conveys the realization that this is a\r\nstudio and creative voice at the very least in a transitional period and\r\narguably in its twilight phase. The music, the tone, the subject matter of the\r\ntwo films, Miyazaki\u2019s candid self-reflection\u2014it all combines to paint a\r\nportrait of something beautiful that\u2019s coming to an end. At nearly two hours,\r\nSanada hits a few of these beats a bit too many times, even for this fan, and\r\nthe film bizarrely feels like it\u2019s ending around the 90-minute mark, complete\r\nwith a production-finishing montage, only to go on for another half-hour. It\u2019s\r\na fascinating look into a creative process that has been essential to the\r\nhistory of animation, but it could have been tighter as a documentary. There\u2019s an amazing passage in which Miyazaki receives a letter\r\nfrom a man who received assistance from Miyazaki\u2019s father after the war. The\r\nproduction of \u201cThe Wind Rises\u201d inspired the man to write Miyazaki, and the\r\ndirector points out how the event \u201cProbably shaped the way this man looked at\r\nthe world.\u201d Reality influenced art which then reflected back on reality. The\r\ntruth is that Miyazaki and the people at Studio Ghibli have been shaping the\r\nway we look at the world for years, and will continue to do so long after the\r\nKingdom has closed.
