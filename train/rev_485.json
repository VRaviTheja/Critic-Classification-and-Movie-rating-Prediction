{"Title": "ABCs of Death 2", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "In a note at the beginning of this picture, the premise,\r\nwhich is pretty much identical to the first \u201cABCs of Death\u201d premise, is laid\r\nout: 26 filmmakers were assigned a word beginning with a particular letter and\r\ntold, more or less, to go and make a horror short based on that word. \u201cThey\r\nwere given complete artistic freedom,\u201d the note continues. I detect a certain\r\npride in this particular assertion. This movie is the work of hardcore genre\r\nfans turned moviemakers\u2014one of the producers, Mark Walkow, is in fact an old\r\nfriend of mine from back in the days of laser discs, and well I remember\r\nchatting animatedly with him about disgracefully expurgated versions of\r\nlatter-day horror classics floating about. Standing behind the most dangerous\r\nvisions of the filmmakers one commissions is commendable, for sure. There\u2019s a\r\n\u201cbut\u201d though, and you don\u2019t need to be Einstein or Irving Thalberg or Joseph E.\r\nLevine to guess what the \u201cbut\u201d involves, and that\u2019s quality control. So this\r\n\u201cABCs of Death\u201d is, either as a result of a surfeit of artistic freedom or just\r\nmy own narrower-than-the-producers\u2019 strictures of taste, as much of a\r\nhit-and-miss affair as the first, which came out in 2012.  Advertisement It is worth noting that, for this viewer, who is indeed a\r\nlong time horror fan himself, the spottiness was not the result of a certain\r\nmode of repetition that the structure of this omnibus encourages. The titles of\r\nthe individual episodes are revealed after, rather than before the episodes\r\nthemselves, which tends to give said titles the quality of punchlines. Now\r\nwhile it\u2019s pretty obvious from the get-go that the \u201cR\u201d episode will be called \u201cRoulette,\u201d\r\nin other cases the punchline option is used with great brio, or as a droll\r\nformal commentary (as is the case with the \u201cS\u201d episode, directed by Juan\r\nMartinez Moreno and my absolute favorite of the bunch). What\u2019s not necessarily\r\nunsurprising is that the gimmick doesn\u2019t get as old as you\u2019d figure given\r\nits iteration. So that\u2019s good. And while early on one feels that the brevity\r\nrequired to get 26 short films into a two-hour slot is likely to impose a samey\r\nabstraction on the proceedings, that doesn\u2019t happen either. Each filmmaker\r\ntakes his or her ball and makes the most out of it.  What results is a survey of\r\nwhat\u2019s both glorious or at least intriguing about the directions in\r\ncontemporary horror, and what\u2019s problematic as well. Often at the same time.\r\nFor instance, in the aforementioned Juan Martinez Moreno episode, a\r\nhome-invasion tale distinguished by really virtuosic multi-screen manipulations\r\nof cinematic space and genuinely excruciating tension, the ghastly pause to\r\ntake in the full measure of a GAPING HEAD WOUND does\u2014not to sound like your\r\ngrandfather who remembers back when movies could be scary without all the\r\ngore\u2014feel a little gratuitous. A certain aspect of The Larger Problem With\r\nContemporary Horror is actually addressed in the next film, the \u201cT\u201d episode, a\r\nbracing and refreshingly snide\u2014and icky\u2014feminist observation from tyros Jen and\r\nSylvia Soska. Little thematic fillips of this sort help make the stretch from\r\n\u201cS\u201d to \u201cW\u201d maybe the strongest of the whole feature, and the streak is broken\r\nwith a blindingly obvious \u201cX\u201d that\u2019s surprisingly by \u201cInside\u201d maestro Julien\r\nMaury, who\u2019s defeated by getting too cute. I suppose in a cultural environment\r\nin which the word \u201cmisogynist\u201d is applied to all manner of cultural material\r\nwith less than perfect discrimination, the final episode actually achieves this\r\nstate, and does so while trying to one-up an infamous sequence from an infamous\r\nLucio Fulci movie. Points for grandstanding here go to director Chris Nash,\r\nwhose name is likely to make me get up and run the other way from hereon in. (I\r\nknow, I\u2019m giving short shrift to \u201cY\u201d here, which is the directorial debut of\r\nveteran Japanese makeup-effects artist Soichi Umezawa. And is a little better\r\nthan OK.)  Genre fans will I suppose understand me well when I say that\r\nwhile I might have only fully enjoyed fewer than half the entries in this film,\r\nI am eager to see the next installment.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
