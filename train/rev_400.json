{"Title": "Life Partners", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Why does it feel nearly revelatory to see a film that treats\r\nfemale friendship with respect? Not as a device to get one of the women hitched\r\nto the right guy and not as an undeveloped subplot to serve as comic relief\r\nuntil said protagonist walks down the aisle. This is at the heart of why \u201cBridesmaids\u201d\r\nwas such a smash success\u2014Kristen Wiig conveyed something truthful about female\r\ncharacters who felt like friends and not plot devices or the broad caricatures of so many Hollywood comedies. And yet we\u2019ve seen few\r\nfilms like it since. And so the moments of believability in the surprisingly\r\nentertaining \u201cLife Partners\u201d have greater resonance. Yes, the plot machinations\r\npuncture a bit of that believability balloon, but the honesty in this film\u2019s\r\ncore love triangle is something that other filmmakers, especially those\r\ninterested in telling stories about women, would be wise to copy. Advertisement Much of that truthfulness can be traced back to casting.\r\nGillian Jacobs was always entertaining on NBC\u2019s \u201cCommunity,\u201d but the hit show\r\nwas often stolen from her by more vibrant personalities like Donald Glover and\r\nDanny Pudi. Here, she proves, without question, that she can carry a film. She\u2019s\r\ngrounded and likable as Paige, best friend to Sasha (Leighton Meester). These\r\ntwo have a nearly co-dependent degree of friendship, talking every day on the\r\nphone, getting together to mock \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model,\u201d and helping each\r\nother through failed relationships. The core of \u201cLife Partners\u201d\u2014the friendship\r\nbetween Jacobs and Meester\u2014is surprisingly genuine, and it goes a long way to\r\nthe success of the overall film. Too many movies about friendship force actors\r\nor actresses who seem like they\u2019d never even talk over the Kraft Services table\r\nmuch less actually hang out to portray friends, and so the core of the film\r\nrings hollow. The core here is solid. And so we feel it when the friendship between Sasha and\r\nPaige is tested by the natural progression of life. Sasha has had nothing but bad luck in love, bouncing\r\nfrom relationship to relationship, and commiserating over her failures with her\r\nother lesbian friends like Jen (Gabourey Sidibe) and Jenn (Beth Dover). Paige\r\nhas seen her share of losers as well, and Tim (Adam Brody, who happens to be\r\nmarried to Meester in real life) looks like just another bad beau at first. He\r\nquotes \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d far too often to be a viable romantic candidate. And yet\r\nhe becomes one. He seems genuinely, sweetly interested in Paige, and the subtle way this\r\nrelationship unfolds is one of the strengths of \u201cLife Partners.\u201d It doesn\u2019t\r\nhappen overnight, as in so many Hollywood rom-coms. When these two fall in love, they do so gradually and believably. Before she knows it, Sasha has to make\r\nroom on the couch for Tim during their weekly \u201cTop Model\u201d snark-fests. And then\r\nPaige is missing them altogether. Paige pushes herself into uninteresting dates\r\n(with scene stealers like Kate McKinnon and Abby Elliott), as so often happens\r\nwhen our friends find partners; we seek out our own with more fervor. More than\r\nanything, \u201cLife Partners\u201d captures how romance alters friendship. We have to\r\nadjust to our friend\u2019s significant others, and realize that we may not be the\r\nmost important person in their life any more, even if they are still the most\r\nimportant person in ours. The first act feels a bit forced in some of its\r\ncharacter set-ups, but once \u201cLife Partners\u201d settles into a loose,\r\ncharacter-based groove, it really works (at least until it's forced out of that\r\nagain with some awkward plot turns in the final half-hour). It\u2019s a sad\r\ncommentary on how rarely we see female friendship that feels truthful in cinema\r\nthat this comes as such a pleasant surprise. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
