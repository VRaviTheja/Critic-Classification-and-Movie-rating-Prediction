{"Title": "Happy Valley", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The location that gives \"Happy Valley\" its title is never meant \r\nto be bitterly ironic; it just turned out that way. The movie's \r\ndirector, Amir Bar-Lev (\"The Tillman Story,\" \"My Kid Could Paint That\"), \r\ndoesn't push the irony. He doesn't push anything, really. He just \r\nrecounts the whole sordid story of the Penn State football scandal \r\nagain, then draws, or tries to draw, some lessons from it.\u00a0 A\r\n few of the lessons we've already heard, and hopefully memorized, if we \r\ndidn't know them already. One is that sexual predators don't tend to \r\nlurk in dark alleyways like cartoon gargoyles, looking for children to \r\nkidnap; they're more likely to hide in plain sight, as the Penn State \r\nfootball program's assistant coach Jerry Sandusky did for so many years,\r\n setting himself up as a model citizen and surrogate father to \r\ngenerations of young men, the better to satisfy his compulsions. (There \r\nare many unsettling images in this film, but the TV news footage and \r\nstill photos of Sandusky's summer camp for boys ranks near the top.)\u00a0 Advertisement Another\r\n lesson is that when a crime is committed, an institution tends to view \r\nreporting it to proper authorities as a last resort. This was \r\ndemonstrated during the investigations into Sandusky's crimes by law \r\nenforcement and the National College Athletics Association. A trail of \r\nemails later revealed that the school's beloved football coach, Joe \r\nPaterno\u2014who reigned over the program for 46 years and died of cancer in \r\n2012, not long after the scandal broke\u2014reported Sandusky to the school \r\nas he was supposed to, then backpedaled and colluded with school \r\nadministrators to keep the abuse a secret so as not to jeopardize the \r\nteam's momentum, the community's pride or the school's finances and \r\nreputation.\u00a0 A third lesson is that when sports\r\n and community pride fuse, as they so often do in college sports-crazy \r\ncommunities, fans just absolutely, positively do not want to hear any \r\nbad news about their team, and tend to avoid it, deny it, minimize it, \r\nor verbally lawyer it away on technicalities. We see the latter \r\nhappening again when reporters\u2014or average citizens who accept that \r\nSandusky committed crimes and Paterno helped cover them up\u2014tell die-hard\r\n Penn State boosters that the school failed its athletes and therefore \r\ndeserves the abuse, scorn and penalties heaped on it, only to be met with \r\nsome variation of, \"Well, Paterno reported it, what more do you want?\" \r\nor \"Those crimes don't have anything to do with the great legacy of Penn\r\n State football.\"\u00a0 \"Happy Valley\" wades into \r\nmore problematic waters when it gets into the subject of guilt by \r\nassociation, and a community's related attempts to deal with scandal by \r\nsimply obliterating any trace of the people who initiated it. Much is \r\nmade here of whether the NCAA was right to take many seasons worth of \r\nPaterno's wins away from him, to send a message about the moral severity\r\n of the offense that he and his colleagues committed by participating in\r\n a cover-up. The program's partisans argue that Sandusky's crimes and \r\nthe program's complicity didn't necessarily contribute to the school's \r\nwon-lost record, and suggesting that they do only confuses the issues. \r\nThere are points where the director seems to be questioning the logic of\r\n that decision as well, even linking it subtly to the community's \r\nattempts to eradicate images and sculptures of Sandusky and Paterno from\r\n local buildings and streets.\u00a0 Advertisement Related to this \r\nis the sense that the entire community, which knew nothing of Sandusky's\r\n crimes or the university's role in hiding them, is being punished along\r\n with the conspirators, by having the Penn State football program taken \r\naway, the athletic records punitively altered, and the words \"Happy \r\nValley\" linked inextricably with sickness, cowardice and evil. What's \r\nthe community's crime, they wonder? Loving football too much?\u00a0 That's\r\n actually an excellent question, not nearly as loaded or defensive as it\r\n sounds. One could make the case that football is the United States of \r\nAmerica's one true religion, the thing that brings everyone together, if\r\n only for a few hours a week, and when a religion is threatened, \r\nthe faithful band together and refuse to listen to reason, and view any \r\nattempt to demand moral accountability from the exemplars of their faith\r\n as a form of blasphemy, or a collective assault.\u00a0 The movie \r\ninvites such comparisons by subtly (and sometimes unsubtly) likening \r\nAmerican football to religion, and its coaches, assistant coaches and \r\nadministrators to church officials entrusted with the care and guidance \r\nof young men. Echoes of the Roman \r\nCatholic Church's sexual abuse scandals are ever-present. When Happy \r\nValley residents discuss and argue the particulars of the Penn State \r\nscandal, you sometimes hear a catch in their voices, or see tears \r\nwelling in their eyes, because their values have been betrayed, or \r\nbecause their unshakable faith in the goodness of the program has opened\r\n them to ridicule and shame, and they know it.\u00a0 It's\r\n slightly frustrating that the movie doesn't venture a point-of-view on \r\nany of these larger issues, which are less clear cut than the matters of\r\n sexual abuse and its immediate enablers. But it's also understandable, \r\nbecause what could \"Happy Valley\" conclude, ultimately? Any summation \r\nmight have seemed glib or sanctimonious. We're left instead with \r\ntroubling questions that might not ever yield satisfying answers.", "Critic": "Delta"}
