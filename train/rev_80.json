{"Title": "The Vanishing of Sidney Hall", "Stars": 0.0, "Review": "In the unlikely event that you\u2019ve ever been truly curious as to how much M.F.A.-style toxic masculinity can be packed into one motion picture, you ought to check out \u201cThe Vanishing of Sidney Hall.\u201d Every other person, and particular persons who love both cinema and literature, can take a hard pass. The movie, directed by Shawn Christensen from a script he co-wrote with Jason Dolan, begins by signaling the precocious literary brilliance of the title character, played by Logan Lerman in \u201cthe twerp is father to the bro\u201d mode, as he reads to a high school class an \u201cessay\u201d describing a girl he once formed a fascination with. \u201cShe had a virginal quality that contrasted her ice-cold outer shell,\u201d he says vehemently. He goes on to describe how he masturbated to this unnamed girl\u2019s image. He gets giggles from the class and a stern look from a female teacher. Sidney then commiserates with a male teacher, Duane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who\u2019s more sympathetic to his work. The female teacher, he advises Sidney, IS a published author. \u201cOf romance novels,\u201d Sidney sneers. \u201cWhat about Hunter S. Thompson or David Foster Wallace?\u201d Sidney asks earnestly. It is perhaps no coincidence that he names two figures who took their own lives. One of the many things the movie can never quite figure out is that either of those authors would have rather never written a single word had they thought themselves capable of writing a sentence as multi-level-abominable as \u201cShe had a virginal quality that contrasted her ice-cold outer shell.\u201d Advertisement The Movie About A Supposedly Great Writer In Which The Writing The Supposedly Great Writer Produces Kind Of Sucks is not, alas, uncommon. The approximations of Philip Roth that peppered Alex Ross Perry\u2019s \u201cListen Up Philip\u201d never landed smoothly but fortunately the movie had enough misanthropic juice in the story and dialogue to more than get by. What \u201cSidney Hall\u201d has is a lot of misogyny. As in an exchange in which the possible Love of Sidney\u2019s Life tells him that she loves Bob Dylan and horror movies and his response is \u201care you sure you\u2019re a girl?\u201d It also has a lot of what have to be shared fantasies of the screenwriters. The idea that a high school kid, writing a novel with the spectacularly on-the-nose title Suburban Tragedy, can get to the top of the New York Times best seller list for eight\u00a0months, is a big reach. (Would that Thompson and Wallace had done so well!) The movie gifts young Sidney with an indulgent assistant, a hotsy-totsy love affair, and a lot of Downsides To Fame that are even more narcissistic than the imaginary upsides. A reader\u2019s dramatic suicide, accompanied by a statement that Sidney Hall has put his cult on the path to \u201cexpose the suburban underbelly of America no matter what the cost.\u201d A D.B. Cooper/J.D. Salinger kind of \u201cdisappearance\u201d that eventually places Sidney on the top of a freight train, smoking a cigarette while in cool sunglasses. How postmodernly \u201cBound for Glory\u201d can you get, people? The movie gives Sidney a kind of stalker, known only as \u201cThe Seeker,\u201d played by Kyle Chandler, who shows up at libraries and bookstores where beardo Sidney shows up to burn copies of his own works, because The Fame Is Bad. The various story threads resolve themselves in flashbacks and flashforwards, the most memorable of which intercuts Sidney being harangued by his mother and Sidney trying to save the life of the woman he has finally realized is his own true love. This is some pretty can\u2019t-live-with-them, can\u2019t-live-without-them stuff, for sure. A climactic flashback reveals the root of Sidney\u2019s guilt has to do with his having watched a video cassette of an unspeakable act that he means to take to the authorities. Only he leaves it in the VCR and the aforementioned mother discovers it, freaks out, and a big old mess ensues. This guy is supposed to be a genius, remember. On the plus side, the movie\u2019s production values are very nice and its cast is notable. And as it happens, neither of those are pluses, because what they mean ultimately is that good money is put into this kind of worthless woman-hating garbage even now.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
