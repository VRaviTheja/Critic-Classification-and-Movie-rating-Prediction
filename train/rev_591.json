{"Title": "Death Note", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "I don\u2019t subscribe to the theory that adaptations of artistically successful source material need remain overly faithful. An adaptation, at its best, should also be an interpretation. It should offer a personal take, a new angle, deepening certain themes while naturally reducing others, etc. However, the decisions made when radically altering source material should feel purposeful, not arbitrary and random. It\u2019s not so much when our favorite books are adapted differently that makes fans angry but when they are lessened by the differences. Such is the case with Adam Wingard\u2019s depressingly awful \u201cDeath Note,\u201d premiering today on Netflix. Several of the changes to Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata\u2019s brilliant manga have already been widely reported, including the whitewashing of the entire project by relocating it from Japan to Seattle, but those are just the symptoms of a greater disease known as complete creative bankruptcy. Advertisement The concept of \u201cDeath Note,\u201d the manga and at least start of the film, is simple. A boy named Light Turner (Nat Wolff) finds a book dropped to Earth by a Shinigami, a Japanese death demon somewhat akin to the Grim Reaper, named Ryuk, voiced in the film by Willem Dafoe. The book says Death Note on the cover and has names written in it over centuries. It also has the rules. Write someone\u2019s name in the book and they will die. In the manga, the rules are extensive and repeated often, but Wingard and writers Charley Parlapanides & Vlas Parlapanides and Jeremy Slater understandably simplify things a bit. In the movie, Light writes a name and a manner of death and it unfolds in front of his eyes. That's about all you need to know. What would you do with that kind of power? In the manga, Light begins testing his own morality by killing criminals, allowing them to die peacefully of heart attacks as he tests the boundaries of playing God. Perhaps recognizing this wouldn\u2019t be thrilling enough for a horror film, the \u201cDeath Note\u201d movie becomes a gorefest almost immediately. Light decides to see if a school bully will truly be decapitated if he writes that on a blank page, and Wingard gleefully stages the ensuing carnage like he\u2019s planning to reboot the \u201cFinal Destination\u201d franchise next. In the film version, Light does move back to \u201cjustified murder,\u201d but even those are Horror Extreme, taking out the man who got away with killing Light\u2019s mother and a criminal holding hostages\u2014both in brutal ways.  The biggest change in the film version of \u201cDeath Note\u201d is the inclusion of a romantic arc with another high school girl named Mia (Margaret Qualley), who is quickly let in on the Angel of Death Game because Light has a crush on her. (One could\u00a0argue that this character is a version of the manga's Misa Amane, an eventual companion for Light in the books but the character's history and purpose are radically different.)\u00a0And the pair soon get a nemesis in the mysterious \u201cL\u201d (Keith Stanfield), who tracks the God of Death known in the press as Kira. One of the best elements of the manga was the cat-and-mouse between Kira/Light and L, but that\u2019s greatly diffused here by the addition of Mia and the changes made to Light\u2019s family, including his police chief father (Shea Whigham).\u00a0 Advertisement And here\u2019s where we get back to the fatal flaw of \u201cDeath Note\u201d: it doesn\u2019t feel like any of these alterations to the source material, and there are many of them, had true artistic or thematic purpose. Why make this or that change? Why add this character or change this plot point? If there\u2019s no true answer, it\u2019s all just a hollow exercise. And the biggest problem is that Wingard and company clearly refused to make Light the antihero he needed to be, and so they add a love interest and pervert the entire concept, leaving the project hollow at its center. Wingard has been a gifted, exciting genre director before with works like \u201cThe Guest\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Next,\u201d but this is misguided in every way. It could be due to years of rewrites of a massive piece of source material, but this movie is a mess on every level, particularly its script.\u00a0The dialogue truly sucks\u2014\u201cWe could change the world.\u201d \u201cWe? As in us?\u201d\u2014but, worst of all, Wingard and his writers never figured out what to do with Ryuk. Yes, a spiky demon voiced by Willem Dafoe is actually boring. Ryuk is a great character, a wisecracking demon who\u2019s fascinated with the flexible morality of human beings. The film version doesn\u2019t know what to do with him, sidelining him until it\u2019s time to turn him into a plot point. Even Ryuk himself looks bored.\u00a0Given the weird bursts of humor and eccentricity in the final project (ex., L\u2019s partner-in-crimesolving Watari sings him \u201cOptimistic Voices\u201d from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to put him to sleep), it\u2019s stunning how few of them come courtesy of Ryuk. In fact, when the oddity of the \u201cL\u201d character is injected into the film (and, to be fair, Stanfield is, as he often is, the best thing about this project) one realizes just how tonally screwed the whole thing is.\u00a0 Most depressingly, given the quality of some of his work (even \"Blair Witch\" has some interesting pieces), the filmmaking here is sporadic, amateurish and haphazard. Wingard verges on black comedy but then pulls back, unsure of what the tone should be of the piece overall. The final scenes are so horrendously constructed and edited that one has to believe the project was rushed or re-shot. And the ending will have you switching off your Netflix app in disgust. If you don't die from boredom before you get there. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
