{"Title": "Concussion", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cI am the wrong person to have discovered this,\u201d Dr. Bennet Omalu, played in this movie by Will Smith, laments to his wife Prema, near the final quarter of \"Concussion.\" Omalu, a practitioner who has such pride in his profession that he corrects people who refer to him as \u201cMister\u201d with \u201cDoctor,\u201d but who is so kind-hearted, brilliant, enthusiastic and likable that the tic doesn\u2019t play here as irritating, is in an unusually American fix in this fact-based drama.\u00a0 \n Omalu is the real-life doctor who, while working as a forensic pathologist in Pittsburgh, discovered a new and terrifying brain disorder that he named Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. He discovered it performing an autopsy on a retired Pittsburgh Steeler named Mike Webster (movingly portrayed here by David Morse). Webster left the game as a hero and began losing his mind well before his death at fifty; scenes shortly before his death show him living in his pickup truck, huffing turpentine. A fellow player, himself to suffer a similar fate in the movie, tries to help him out. Neither man understands what\u2019s happening to them. Omalu figures it out:\u00a0 the persistent head injuries sustained in football play shake up the brain\u2014as the character explains, unlike some other mammals, humans don\u2019t have built-in shock absorbers for their grey matter\u2014and release a protein that builds up and causes hallucinations, memory loss, and much more trauma.\u00a0 Advertisement \n This film, written and directed by Peter Landesman and based in part on a 2009 magazine article, portrays Omalu as a cheerful, quietly religious man who, as a Nigerian-born immigrant, believes strongly in the American Dream, and believes that doing the right thing is part of that whole trip. The response his findings elicit from the NFL quickly prove him mistaken. As Omalu\u2019s boss and mentor, played by Albert Brooks with a nice mix of world-weariness and faith, puts it, Omalu is going up against an organization that \u201cowns a day of the week.\u201d Omalu thinks the NFL will be glad of his findings, and use some American ingenuity to do something about the problem. This is not what occurs. \n Will Smith\u2019s performance as Omalu is lovely: small-scaled, precise, imbued with righteousness but not tritely pious. One thing I\u2019ve noticed when Smith essays such a performance in a movie that\u2019s not entirely bad (and this movie is rather good): my fellow critics seem a little surprised. I don\u2019t understand why. Even since before his first \u201cserious\u201d film, an adaptation of the acclaimed stage play \u201cSix Degrees Of Separation,\u201d he was clearly a gifted and versatile performer. Although his career in recent years has admittedly encompassed a lot of work in which he more or less merely has to \u201cbe Will Smith,\u201d that hasn\u2019t necessarily led to a diminishment of his chops. He\u2019s also surrounded by expert players, including Alec Baldwin as a one-time team doctor who\u2019s both disturbed and stimulated by Omalu\u2019s findings, and who tries to build a bridge between Omalu and the stonewalling NFL, an effort that ends in teeth-gritting frustration.\u00a0 \n The movie also depicts Omalu\u2019s personal life. You know that feeling when you have no social life because you\u2019re devoted to your work and your church, and some of the church elders ask you to provide a room from a recent immigrant from abroad, and that immigrant turns out to look just like Gugu Mbatha-Raw? No, I don\u2019t either. But that\u2019s what happens to Smith\u2019s character, and soon enough Mbatha-Raw\u2019s character, Prema, is more than a roommate. The movie treats the couple\u2019s relationship, and their strong faith, with refreshing delicacy and respect. And Mbatha-Raw makes Prema more than a long-suffering helpmate as the hostility against Omalu and his findings begins to mount.\u00a0 Advertisement \n The movie is engaging and fascinating for much of its two hours. The editing, by Oscar-winner William Goldenberg (he won for \u201cArgo\u201d and also put together \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d for which he was also nominated), is brisk and inventive, managing to imbue excitement into montages in which Omalu is doing nothing more pulse-pounding than looking at a bunch of slides. Once Omalu finds fans, players, and the football industry itself giving him the very aggressive side-eye, the narrative begins to diffuse a bit. The movie isn\u2019t shy about implicating that NFL chief Roger Goodell (played here by Luke Wilson) is a corporate weasel and liar. But as certain bad things begin happening around Omalu and his colleagues and his wife, things grow vague; the movie, I suppose, can\u2019t just come out and SAY that the NFL is willing and able to do stuff that skirts \u201cParallax View\u201d/\u201dThree Days of the Condor\u201d territory. I found that this possibly involuntary discretion worked to the movie\u2019s advantage; the non-ratcheting up of the drama somehow made the story feel more true, more honest. The real story, in a sense, is how Omalu\u2019s belief in the goodness of some institutions came under assault, and how he refused to become a cynic even after all that. When he\u2019s called an American hero near the end of the movie, the truth of that phrase, as well as all the contradictions that trail in its wake, are vividly felt.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
