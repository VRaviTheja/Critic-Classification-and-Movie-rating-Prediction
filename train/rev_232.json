{"Title": "Dark Was the Night", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "This movie opens at a logging camp, a setting little seen in\r\ncontemporary cinema. Trees getting cut, woods getting shredded, in a\r\nformidable forest framed by intimidating grey sky. It\u2019s the end of the work\r\nday, and the men are supposed to be coming in, but a supervisor talks into his\r\nwalkie talkie; he\u2019s not getting an answer from some workers, and he\u2019s annoyed.\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t hesitate to lock you guys in for the weekend,\u201d he says, and he gets no\r\nanswer, so he goes deeper in to the woods to investigate. Advertisement What he sees is not pleasant, and he\u2019s not going to be able\r\nto share his subsequent experience with anybody. \u201cDark Was The Night\u201d is a\r\nhorror movie, a creepy and atmospheric and sometimes blood-soaked horror movie,\r\nand it\u2019s got a good amount going for it. Even though it does split from the\r\nnovel logging-camp setting to something a little more generic, the small town\r\nof Maiden Woods, 90 miles south from the opening unpleasantness. Here, too, it\u2019s\r\npretty grey, and folks aren\u2019t exactly perky. The town sheriff Paul Shields\r\n(Kevin Durand) and his new deputy Donny Saunders (Lucas Haas), considered a\r\nnovelty on account of his hailing from New York City (the picture was shot\r\nupstate) have their attention called to some unusual happenings\u2014a cranky stable\r\nman\u2019s missing horse most prominently\u2014and eventually see a pattern forming. A\r\npattern that suggests something otherworldly that\u2019s doing a lot of killing.  Director Jack Heller shows a firm grasp of horror movie\r\nmechanics, laying on the shocks and the atmosphere with assurance and vitality.\r\nScreenwriter Tyler Hisel\u2019s storyline, though, shows an equally firm grasp of\r\nsome genre conventions that are a bit tired. Shields is estranged from his wife\r\nSusan (Bianca Kajlich), seeming to share custody of their young son and quietly\r\nrefusing Susan\u2019s offer to seek counseling with him. It turns out that their problems\r\nstem from the loss of another child (seen in family photographs wearing a red\r\nslicker that brings to mind \u201cDon\u2019t Look Now\u201d) that Shields couldn\u2019t prevent.\r\nThis sets up a whole super-obvious\r\nself-blaming-taciturn-father-figure-finds-shot-at-redemption scenario. Donny\u2019s\r\ngot his skeletons too. This is less tiresome than it might be on account of the\r\nsparse dialogue and the excellent acting from Durand and Haas, but it gave me\r\nsome qualms that I\u2019d sooner not have experienced early on in the picture. \"Dark Was the Night\" does, deliberately, build to a tense and\r\nsometimes jump-from-your-seat scary climax which finds most of the small town\u2019s\r\nresidents holed up in the local church, trying to nail down what has by this\r\ntime been pretty firmly established as a bonafide monster stalking the local\r\nwoods. And the quest is, it turns out, made more engaging by the guilt and\r\nself-doubt experienced by its main characters. As for the creature itself, it\r\ncould have been pretty ridiculous, but a combination of smart effects design (I\r\nbelieve Danny Shinwoong Kang is the responsible effects person) and cinematic\r\ndiscretion make\u00a0the damn thing work. And so, too, does the movie itself.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
