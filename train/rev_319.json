{"Title": "Love & Mercy", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The most heartening surprise about director Bill Pohlad\u2019s\r\n\u201cLove and Mercy\u201d is also to my mind a pretty improbable one. That is, that it\u2019s\r\nsuch a good and at times better than good movie. The rise and fall and rise and\r\nfall and rise of genius musician Brian Wilson, a life story that disproves\r\nFitzgerald\u2019s adage about there being no second acts in America in what seems like\r\nthe most perverse way imaginable, looks on paper to be too sprawling, too\r\nchaotic, to be distilled into a coherent, never mind compelling, cinematic\r\nnarrative of conventional length.  Advertisement But longtime producer Pohlad (\u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d \u201c12\r\nYears A Slave\u201d), working from a daring\r\nscript by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, and using two first-rate\r\nactors to play Wilson at two turning points in his life, lavishes his material\r\nwith love, attention to detail, and empathetic imagination. The result is a\r\nstory that\u2019s hair-raisingly watchable and frequently moving, regardless of what\r\nyou believe you might already know of Wilson\u2019s life.  The movie shuttles back and forth between two distinct\r\nperiods. In the mid \u201860s, Paul Dano\u2019s Wilson is the baby-faced\r\nmusical genius of the Beach Boys who\u2019s burning out on the road life. He\u2019s got\r\nthis amazing music in his head, and he manages to get quite a bit of it out,\r\ndespite the resentful sniping of his abusive ex-manager father, the hostility\r\nof at least one bandmate who doesn\u2019t get why Brian isn\u2019t writing more hits, and\r\nan increasingly fragile psychic state that is not helped by an exposure to LSD.\r\nCusack plays the Wilson of the late '80s, supposedly brought back from a\r\ncomplete psychotic break by psychological miracle worker Dr. Eugene Landy, who\r\nbecame such a part of Wilson\u2019s life that he presumed to make himself a partner\r\nin the creation of Wilson\u2019s music. John Cusack\u2019s Wilson wanders desultorily\r\ninto a Cadillac dealership (although we soon see he\u2019s got a bodyguard trailing\r\nhim, and a mini-entourage trailing the bodyguard), charms attractive young\r\nsalesperson Melinda (Elizabeth Banks), who at first has no idea who the sweetly\r\neccentric fellow is. After telling her he wants the car in which they\u2019ve stolen\r\na few precious moments removed from the outside world, he scrawls on her\r\nbusiness card and leaves it on the steering wheel of the car. The words he\u2019s\r\nwritten are \u201cLonely/Frightened/Scared.\u201d Landy, played with terrifying intensity and smarm by Paul\r\nGiamatti, has by this point in time morphed from someone in service of Wilson\r\nto a malignant Svengali. His monstrous manipulations are bad enough in\r\nisolation, but when intercut with scenes of the younger Wilson shrinking at the\r\ndisapprobation of the father\u2014who beat him to deafness in one ear, but from whom Brian still craves approval\u2014or the\r\ncousin/bandmate who hectors him over jokey song lyrics and musical direction,\r\nthey are genuinely heart-rending and angering. The movie creates a rather\r\neffective suspense story: as Melinda gets closer and closer to Brian, under\r\nLandy\u2019s paranoid gaze, one wonders just how much fortitude Mr. Wilson\u2019s new\r\nlove interest has, and if she has that fortitude, can she get what she needs to\r\ndeliver Brian from what he describes as his \u201chell.\u201d It gets pretty tense.  Meanwhile, back in the \u201860s, Pohlad and Dano and a host of excellent supporting players simulate the creation of such ground-breaking pop works as Pet Sounds and \u201cGood Vibrations.\u201d Usually fictionalized scenes of music-making are as convincing as cinematic depictions of painters painting (that is, not at all), so the very compelling scenes in which young Brian corrals the crack L.A. session players known as \u201cThe Wrecking Crew\u201d into accepting and then conjuring his sometimes eccentric musical visions feel almost miraculous. And Banks, who brings equal notes of beauty-queen sunniness and Girl Scout rectitude to her portrayal of Melinda (who did, spoiler alert, become Mrs. Wilson after the events depicted in this film) has an interesting chemistry with the haltingly charming and sometimes tragically wrung-out Cusack.

But even when Pohlad puts a foot wrong, he does so in an interesting way. This isn\u2019t the kind of movie in which you expect to find a resonating allusion to \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d and yet there one is. And while I have to say it didn\u2019t quite work for me, I\u2019ve got to give Pohlad credit for nerve. In any event, there\u2019s more than enough of real value in the movie in spite of that. Not just its content, but its bedrock belief in people, in spite of all the awful things people can do. This philosophy is also a big part of Wilson\u2019s music, a point that\u2019s brought home as the end titles roll.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
