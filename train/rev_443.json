{"Title": "Two Night Stand", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "A few years back, when \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d-redolent\r\nzombie movies started popping up like, well, zombies, there was a joke among\r\nmovie mavens who were past masters of the genre, to the effect of \u201cHaven\u2019t the\r\ncharacters in these zombie movies ever seen any\u2026zombie movies? Because if they\r\nhad, they\u2019d know to shoot the zombies in the head. Problem solved.\u201d I had a\r\nsimilar thought watching \u201cTwo Night Stand,\u201d a slight but not-unengaging Young\r\nPerson\u2019s Romantic Comedy, at a point when the two main characters, charmingly\r\nplayed by Annaleigh Tipton and Miles Teller, discuss The Female Orgasm.\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t these kids seen \u2018When Harry Met Sally\u2019?\u201d True, it\u2019s not difficult to\r\nimagine male millennials avoiding the Nora Ephron/Rob Reiner picture like the\r\nplague, but That Clip is sufficiently ubiquitous\u2026 Advertisement This is admittedly a minor quibble. It\u2019s not even really a\r\nquibble. However, it\u2019s not an entirely great sign about a movie\u2019s precise level of engagement when such thoughts\r\noccur. Take that as you will. Written by Mark Hammer, who also wrote for the\r\nMTV Young Person\u2019s Edgy Lifestyles series \u201cSkins,\u201d and directed by Max Nichols,\r\nwhose prior screen credit is a small role as a child actor in Milos Forman\u2019s\r\n\u201cRagtime,\u201d \u201cTwo Night Stand\u201d gets off to a somewhat rocky start in establishing\r\nits 21st-Century-Zeitgeist bonafides. \"Montage of Quirkily Attractive\r\nYoung Woman Prevaricating Over The Details Of Her Online Dating Profile,\r\nComplete With CGI Balloons Depicting Instant Messaging Dialogue\"? Check.\r\n\"Personal Observations Buttressed With Knowing Pop Culture References\"? Check.\r\n(Sample: Tipton\u2019s character, a breakup victim who\u2019s been taking it hard on her\r\nsassy roomie\u2019s couch, notes of her current existence, \u201cI\u2019m going backwards\u2026I\u2019m\r\nBenjamin Buttoning!\u201d) \u201cYou Live In BROOKLYN? Joke Directed At A Potential Sex\r\nPartner?\" Check.  Tipton\u2019s Megan impulsively hooks up with Teller\u2019s Alec;\r\nhostilities and misunderstandings ensue after the deed is done and she\u2019s\r\nlooking to make a getaway, but the getaway\u2019s impossible because a blizzard has\r\nsocked New York City and the now-resentful duo is snowed in. (Michael Showalter\u2019s\r\nTV-screen bit part as a \u201cwacky\u201d weatherman is broad but not undiverting.) This\r\nis where the movie settles in and gets interesting, as the two discern an\r\nopportunity for complete honesty in the current situation. It\u2019s not \u201cSexual\r\nPerversity In Chicago,\u201d nor is it meant to be, as romantic comedy convention\r\ncalls for a cessation of hostility at some point. Tipton and Teller, neither of\r\nwhom is conventionally glamorous, mesh well together, and Nichols keeps their\r\nexchanges brisk and makes the most of the limited cinematic space the scenario\r\ndemands he work with. (And yes, the gentleman is more than a bit player in\r\n\u201cRagtime;\u201d his father is Mike Nichols, a director who\u2019s handled his share of\r\niconic rom-coms\u2014\u201cWorking Girl,\u201d \u201cHeartburn,\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf,\u201d\r\nthat sort of thing.) Where the movie loses what oomph it has is in the\r\ncutaways to the ostensibly high-style canoodlings of Megan\u2019s roomie and her\r\nboyfriend, which look like outtakes from a particularly dopey CW sitcom, and of\r\ncourse the commit-cute finale in which the \"Meant For Each Otherness\" of it all\r\nis asserted.\u00a0 Such scenes always involve\r\nmore than a modicum of contrivance, as in the airport-gate-slow-clap scene; in\r\nany event, this one sets the \"Big Realization\" on New Year\u2019s Eve, which suggests\r\nwriter Hammer has seen \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d even if his characters haven\u2019t.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
