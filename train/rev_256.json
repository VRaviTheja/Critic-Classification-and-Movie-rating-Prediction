{"Title": "Bad Turn Worse", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cBad Turn Worse\u201d joins a long line of movies about people\r\nwho stayed in dangerous, desperate places just a little too long (it was\r\noriginally called \u201cWe Gotta Get Out of This Place\u201d). Simon and Zeke Hawkins\u2019\r\nconfident thriller opens by name-checking Jim Thompson, and proceeds to tell a\r\ntale that Thompson himself would have admired in its duplicitous simplicity.\r\nWith its constant state of twilight lighting, cinematography that somehow\r\nconveys what feels like oppressive heat, and characters stuck in criminal\r\nquicksand, \u201cBad Turn Worse\u201d actually earns that Thompson comparison at its\r\nbest. It\u2019s a confident, engaging film, undone by some narrative sag in the\r\nmiddle but worth seeing for its opening and closing acts. Advertisement Bobby (Jeremy Allen White of \u201cShameless\u201d) and Sue (Mackenzie\r\nDavis of \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d) are leaving the podunk town in which they\u2019ve\r\ngrown up in Middle of Nowhere, Texas. They\u2019re going to college, leaving behind\r\nSue\u2019s lunk of a boyfriend B.J. (Logan Huffman). On one of their last nights\r\ntogether, B.J. decides that the trio should go out in style. He bankrolls the\r\npartying by robbing the safe of his moronic boss Giff (Mark Pellegrino), after\r\nfiguring out that everything, from his pin number to the combination in his\r\noffice, is based on a variation of his favorite number: 69. B.J. is the kind of\r\ntestosterone-heavy man-child who doesn\u2019t think before he acts and seriously\r\nunderestimates the malevolence in the heart of his employer. Bobby and B.J. come in the next day to work to find Giff\r\nrepeatedly kicking the Mexican employee that he thinks robbed him. To try and\r\nstop the violence, Bobby announces that he took the money, protecting B.J. and,\r\nfoolishly, thinking he can now make things right. Giff tells Bobby that in\r\norder to repay him, he\u2019ll have to do a job, an even bigger robbery of a crime\r\nlord named Big Red, who launders money through Giff\u2019s place of business. Of course, this can\u2019t\r\npossibly end well.  \u201cBad Turn Worse\u201d is a story in which the dread comes from\r\nwell-defined feelings like desperation and jealousy. B.J. lashes out at the two\r\nfriends leaving him behind in this desolate Texas landscape with nothing but\r\nthe inevitable path to his asshole employer\u2019s life. B.J. becomes Giff becomes\r\nBig Red. It\u2019s the circle of criminal life. Dutch Southern\u2019s script works\r\nbecause we can feel the emotion behind B.J.\u2019s lashing out at the two people leaving him behind.\r\nAs played by Huffman, B.J. is the kind of kid who figured out a long time ago that Bobby and Sue are smarter than him, and\r\nlikely headed to lives that will leave him behind. Therefore, his violent\r\nstupidity feels organic to the emotion of his character and not merely a plot\r\ndevice as in so many lesser indie thrillers. Huffman\u2019s performance is balanced by those by White, Davis\r\nand Pellegrino. The young star of \u201cShameless\u201d has a face that Thompson would\r\nhave loved\u2014all sunken, sleepy eyes that disguise a mind that\u2019s always\r\ndeciphering what to do next. Davis is a future star, so charismatic on the AMC\r\nhit and well-cast here as the girl who outgrew her small town upbringing\r\nthrough literature and intellectual exploration. She needed to get outta this\r\nplace a long time ago. And Pellegrino is fantastic here, truly disturbing in\r\nhis gleeful propensity for violence. Advertisement \u201cBad Turn Worse\u201d starts off with such energy\u2014I wanted more\r\ndialogue-driven scenes like the opening diner bit about Thompson and whether or\r\nnot it should be called \u201cBacon & Egg\u201d instead of the plural if you only\r\nhave one egg\u2014that it\u2019s bound to sag a bit when the robbery plotting kicks in.\r\nIt often feels like the trio is too often discussing the intricacies of the\r\nplot when more character development would have helped. The Hawkins regain the\r\nfilm\u2019s energy in a disturbing scene that reveals the depth of Giff\u2019s insanity\r\nand in the final scenes of inevitable double and triple crosses. Just as in\r\nThompson\u2019s best work, \u201cBad Turn Worse\u201d takes its characters and their fates\r\nseriously. And its accomplishment is that so do we.", "Critic": "Beta"}
