{"Title": "The Wolfpack", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The story behind \u201cThe Wolfpack,\u201d one of this year\u2019s buzziest\r\nSundance docs, is one of that blessed event in filmmaking\u2014blind luck.\u00a0Director Crystal Moselle was walking down an NYC street one day when\r\nshe saw six young men in suits and sunglasses coming in the other direction.\r\nThey passed by her and Moselle had the instinct to turn around and ask them their\r\nstory. And what a story she heard. The Angulo brothers\u2014six young men with\r\nsimilar features and long black hair\u2014brought her up to their tiny apartment,\r\nshared with a shy mother and aggressive father. Moselle learned that the Angulos\r\nhad barely been allowed to leave this apartment over the course of their entire\r\nexistence, raised in a secluded, near-cult family, allegedly driven by\r\nfather Oscar\u2019s fear of the real world. With an abusive father and no contact\r\nwith the outside world, the Angulos became obsessed with feature films, writing\r\nout scripts for flicks like \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d and \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d by pausing the DVDs and then\r\nreenacting them in fine detail. Film became their only portal to the real world, their way to\r\nexpress their fears and desires. And Moselle caught these boys just as they\r\nwere moving from a world lit by a television tube to one with sunlight. Advertisement Clearly, Moselle had instant affection for the Angulo boys.\r\nIt\u2019s hard not to. They are remarkably sweet and gentle, and the sadness in\r\ntheir eyes, especially the older ones, when they discuss their heartbreaking\r\nupbringing and fear of the real world is the kind that makes you want to give\r\nthem a hug. Early in \u201cThe Wolfpack,\u201d the older boys ask if she got up to their\r\napartment OK, as if something bad would happen to her in the lobby, and are excited to cook\r\ndinner for their special guest. It\u2019s clear from Moselle\u2019s verit\u00e9 style, in\r\nwhich she doesn\u2019t often seem to ask follow-up questions but let the boys come\r\nto their own emotional conclusions, that she was very concerned about these\r\nyoung men, as anybody would be. But the arms-length approach can be\r\nfrustrating. There are times when the Angulos seem to be directing \u201cThe\r\nWolfpack\u201d more than Moselle, and it\u2019s an incredible story that would have benefited\r\nfrom a surer hand. Despite the sense sometimes that Moselle isn\u2019t driving \u201cWolfpack\u201d\r\nin the way needed to make it truly work, she undeniably finds some beautiful\r\nmoments in the trajectory of the Angulos, although they are sometimes so\r\nfleeting as to frustrate when they aren\u2019t further developed. The most striking\r\nmoment comes when an Angulo says that \u201cWe\r\nwere frightened kids\u2026that\u2019s one of the first memories I have,\u201d when\r\ndiscussing the abusive Oscar, who one claims ended every fight with mom with a\r\nslap. Moselle then cuts to a figure of Mukunda, the most reflective of the\r\nboys, in a detailed Batman costume, before reenacting \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d Do the\r\nboys relate to macho, male-driven films because they haven\u2019t had a decent male\r\nrole model in their lives? Are they drawn to the melancholy of Nolan\u2019s take on\r\nthe character because it reflects their own?  Much of \u201cThe Wolfpack\u201d is undeniably moving, especially as\r\nthe boys come out into the real world, frightened and unsure of themselves.\r\nThey see \u201cbig f**king trees\u201d and\r\ncompare them \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d They see \u201cThe Fighter\u201d and are happy that\r\ntheir ticket money will go to Christian Bale. There\u2019s a na\u00efve, heartwarming\r\napproach to the power of cinema in \u201cThe Wolfpack\u201d that clearly appealed to the\r\ncinephiles in Park City.  Could Moselle have found a way to make this incredible story\r\ninto an incredible film? Part of the problem may be that she came upon the\r\nAngulos at the time they were emerging from their near imprisonment and that\r\nmade her hesitant to pry into their pasts for fear of placing blocks in what seems like a road to recovery, as anybody would be. When mom says\r\nthat she grew up in the Midwest and thinks public school \u201csocialization\u201d is not\r\nthat good, anybody would almost feel impolite to pry further into her\r\nbackground or the falsity of that belief. And yet that\u2019s what separates great documentaries\r\nfrom good ones.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
