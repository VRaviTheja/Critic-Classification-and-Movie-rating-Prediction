{"Title": "Before I Go to Sleep", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Christine Lucas (Nicole Kidman) wakes up every day thinking\r\nthat she\u2019s 15 years younger than her actual age. She doesn\u2019t recognize the man\r\nlying next to her. The 40-year-old in the mirror doesn\u2019t look right. She\u2019s not\r\neven sure where she is. Not unlike Guy Pearce\u2019s memorable lead in \u201cMemento,\u201d\r\nChristine has psychogenic amnesia. She was in a car accident over a decade ago.\r\nSince that day, she has rebooted after every night\u2019s sleep. She doesn\u2019t\r\nremember anything that happened the day before, and only gets occasional flashes\r\nof memory of the past 14 years. Her husband Ben (Colin Firth) has to go through\r\nthe same routine every morning, helped by photos on the bathroom wall with\r\nPost-Its like \u201cBen, Your Husband.\u201d Each day, Ben explains Christine\u2019s\r\npredicament to her, as he goes to work and she sits around the house, waiting\r\nfor the next night\u2019s restart button. Advertisement From the very beginning of \u201cBefore I Go to Sleep,\u201d this premise\r\nfeels faulty, at best. As directed by Rowan Joffe (\u201cBrighton Rock\u201d), the\r\nopening scenes make it clear that this is not a\r\nfilm with actual characters or relatable people within it. There\u2019s no exhaustion\r\nin Ben\u2019s voice, as there would be having done this routine every single day. Everything\r\nabout the moment reeks of manipulative set-up instead of something real, and\r\nthat feeling that you\u2019re being as played with as Christine herself. \u201cBefore I\r\nGo to Sleep\u201d is a movie with nothing to hold on to but a paper-thin mystery\r\nwith really only one of two possible suspects in the end.  As you can guess, there\u2019s more to Christine\u2019s story than Ben\u2019s\r\ninitial explanation. After her husband leaves for work, she gets a call from\r\nDr. Nasch (Mark Strong), a neuropsychologist who has been working with her for\r\nthe past few weeks. He tells her to find the digital camera in the back of her wardrobe.\r\nShe\u2019s been recording revelations every day, reminding herself of what she\u2019s\r\ndiscovered about Ben, her \u201caccident\u201d and more. She hasn\u2019t lost her memory from\r\na car accident. She was brutally attacked. By whom? Why? And what else is Ben\r\nkeeping from her? How much could you trust someone who you think is a stranger\r\neven if he tells you he\u2019s not? Of course, every question in a film like this has an answer.\r\nIt\u2019s a screenwriting exercise more than a film. It\u2019s hollow, the kind of quick\r\nbeach read that could satisfy on a summer vacation (and was based on such a\r\nbook) but Joffe hasn\u2019t justified transitioning it to the big screen. There\u2019s no\r\nedge, no pulp, no grit under its fingernails.  Part of the problem is that Joffe seems bored by his own\r\nmaterial. \u201cBefore I Go to Sleep\u201d needed to be stylish to play like a classic\r\nthriller or edgy to replicate the sense of confusion inherent in Christine\u2019s\r\nsituation. It\u2019s neither. The film is visually flat, disappointingly shot mostly\r\nin boring close-ups as one of the three central actors explains what\u2019s\r\nhappening now. And Joffe and his team try to increase the film\u2019s intensity with\r\nboring, cheap sound design, with multiple occasions of trucks that barely miss\r\nChristine as she\u2019s crossing the street or quick cuts to a loud, overhead plane.\r\nIt\u2019s supposed to be unsettling. It\u2019s just cheap. Advertisement Partially by virtue of its piling-up revelations and dual\r\nsuspect structure (only Ben or Dr. Nasch could be the \u201cbad guy\u201d since there\u2019s\r\nno one else in the movie that seems to matter, especially not a character named Claire who really could have been named Plot Device), \u201cBefore I Go to Sleep\u201d is a\r\nfilm that\u2019s constantly explaining itself to you. Here\u2019s what Christine knows now. Here\u2019s the latest revelation. Here\u2019s\r\nhow she feels about it. Every scene is designed to push you to a new\r\nrevelation. Honestly, I longed for just one scene of everyday life in Christine\u2019s\r\nexistence to add an ounce of realism to the production. It\u2019s a film with no\r\ncharacters. To be fair, the fact that Kidman gets this much honest emotion out of\r\nthis script is a testament to her skill level. With a lesser actress, the\r\nresult would be even more disingenuous. She gives it her all. The movie just\r\ngives nothing back to her.", "Critic": "Beta"}
