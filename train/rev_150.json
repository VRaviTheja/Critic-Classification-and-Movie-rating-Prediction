{"Title": "A Futile & Stupid Gesture", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The good men and women of the National Lampoon changed comedy forever. The impact of their magazine and movies like \u201cAnimal House\u201d and \u201cCaddyshack\u201d can undeniably be felt in almost all modern comedy, but certainly in the quirky style of writer/actor/director David Wain. One of the members of \u201cThe State\u201d and the team behind \u201cWet Hot American Summer,\u201d Wain has always operated under the \u201ccomedy ensemble\u201d concept of filmmaking and TV, bringing together the same performers over and over again, often skewering expectations of the genre, as in his spoof of rom-coms, the underrated \u201cThey Came Together.\u201d Could he be too good a fit for the story of National Lampoon? Does this explain why \u201cA Futile & Stupid Gesture,\u201d while being full of likable and funny people isn\u2019t all that funny or likable? Because it's too much like telling your own story?\u00a0While there\u2019s a bit of hero worship going on that deflates the piece, and Wain\u2019s direction is surprisingly uninspired, the biggest problem is the script that tries to cover too much ground but doesn\u2019t really have that much to say as it does so. Advertisement There\u2019s a scene in this film about the rise of National Lampoon that sums it up in ways that writers John Aboud and Michael Colton certainly didn\u2019t intend. The writers are sitting around throwing out ideas when Tony Hendra (Matt Lucas) drops a dull idea\u2014drawing Nixon with Pinocchio\u2019s nose. For some reason, this bad joke that nearly got Hendra run out of the room kept coming back to me. Just as it\u2019s an obvious way to convey a message\u2014Nixon is a liar\u2014too much of \u201cA Futile & Stupid Gesture\u201d takes a similarly predictable route to gets its history across. The story of Doug Kenney and the ascendance of National Lampoon is told primarily through narration and montage. It\u2019s a Greatest Hits collection, hitting the beats that anyone who saw \u201cDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead\u201d already knows, and doing so incredibly superficially. The best thing about Wain\u2019s film is the casting, including one brilliant piece of meta analysis, but that only gets a movie so far.    Will Forte plays Kenney, who took the Harvard Lampoon that they helped through one of its most successful phases and turned it into an international phenomenon with his best buddy, Henry Beard (Domhnall Gleeson, giving the most grounded and interesting performance in the film despite an awful wig.) When they get to New York and found the magazine, the film rushes through a decade or so of history from the first days of groundbreaking comedy through the movies and up to Kenney\u2019s death in 1980. We meet tons of the major comedians from the era including Gilda Radner (Jackie Tohn), Bill Murray (Jon Daly), John Landis (Brian Huskey), John Belushi (John Gemberling), Christopher Guest (Seth Green), and the one and only Chevy Chase, played by his \u201cCommunity\u201d co-star Joel McHale, with whom he had a notoriously contentious on-set relationship. Imagine playing one of your least favorite co-workers in a film. McHale doesn\u2019t go for parody, nailing Chase\u2019s rhythms and comedic timing, although it\u2019s telling that Chase is portrayed here is something of an enabler for his best buddy when it comes to drugs.    Martin Mull plays an older version of Doug Kenney, which is itself a slightly crazy framing choice given that Kenney died when he was 36. So is Mull playing Kenney from the afterlife? The truth is that it\u2019s a lazy narrative choice, allowing Kenney to comment on his own story from afar, although it would have been just as effective to have Forte do these fourth-wall breaks. It\u2019s almost like someone just wanted to get Mull in the movie and the other parts were taken. The emphasis on Kenney is particularly frustrating narratively in that this is way more his story than that of Lampoon. Of course, Kenney is a breakthrough voice in comedy, but there\u2019s a more balanced version of this story that\u2019s way more interesting.    Advertisement Worst of all, \u201cA Futile and Stupid Gesture\u201d can\u2019t keep its irreverent, NL-inspired tone throughout, and Wain can\u2019t quite handle the serious stuff\u2014one gets the impression he\u2019d much rather be hanging out in the writer\u2019s room or behind-the-scenes of the radio show than dealing with Kenney\u2019s drug addiction and infidelities. The superficial reimagining of comedy highlights is kinda fun in a \u201cThe Chris Farley Show\u201d kind of way (\u201cRemember that food fight? That was awesome.\u201d) but that tone definitely doesn\u2019t work when the film has to be even remotely serious. At one point, Kenney says \u201cComedy doesn\u2019t have to be pretty. It should be fucking raw.\u201d In the way it handles both comedy and misery, I wish this movie was too.", "Critic": "Beta"}
