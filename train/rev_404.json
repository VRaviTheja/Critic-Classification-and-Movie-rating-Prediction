{"Title": "From Nowhere", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Back in the day when socially-conscious cinema also had a shot at finding a mainstream audience, some films in that category used the phrase \u201ctorn from today\u2019s headlines\u201d to add a little marketing sizzle. \u201cFrom Nowhere,\u201d which is about three teenage high-schoolers in the Bronx facing deportation because of their undocumented status, is clearly a movie of that ilk, although given the contemporary mode of socially conscious movies, to advertise itself as such would be unforgivably crass. Like most such pictures made in the U.S. today, this is an indie that keeps its indignation under tight wraps, a message picture that tries to convert the nonbelievers in the audience by presenting its message in the most polite way possible. Of course, the people who would most benefit from exposure to the message\u2014that undocumented aliens in the United States are, for the most part, people like you and me, as opposed to inhuman ISIS sleeper agents\u2014are not the kind of people who\u2019d go to an indie message movie.  Advertisement To tell you the truth, I\u2019m not someone who\u2019d go see an indie message movie myself, not anymore. I\u2019ve seen too many of them and I didn\u2019t get into movies for the social consciousness in the first place. That said, \u201cFrom Nowhere,\u201d directed by Matthew Newton from a screenplay by Newton and Kate Ballen, is an entirely watchable and sometimes engaging effort that serves as a great showcase for both the new and more seasoned members of its cast. The picture opens with Julianne Nicholson, as a high school teacher named Jackie, trying to get Shakespeare across to her students. They are typically uninterested, except for Moussa (J. Mallory McCree), who hits her with some on-target observations on King Lear. Moussa is one of three students to whom Jackie, working slightly under the radar of her school superiors, has recommended to an immigration lawyer played by Denis O\u2019Hare. The others are Raquel Castro\u2019s Alyssa, the school\u2019s valedictorian, from Peru, and Octavia Chavez-Richmond\u2019s Sophie, a Dominican girl. Moussa\u2019s family is from Guinea, and seems to have the most traumatic past. Which is a good thing, according to O\u2019Hare\u2019s lawyer. \u201cGenocide, genital mutilation, and dictators\u201d are three things immigration judges love to hear about, he advises them brusquely in an early scene. Once he discharges them back into the world, the trio has trouble enough navigating the narratives of their own chaotic lives, let alone constructing a credible narrative to bring before a court.  Moussa\u2019s conflicts with his mother result in a stand-off neither wants. His problems with his girlfriend are exacerbated by his concern for Sophie. Sophie is hiding, from everyone, a home life that included blatant sexual harassment if not outright abuse. The tension spills out into everyone\u2019s social lives, leading to one intense confrontation with beat cops over nothing. But nothing could become everything if even one of these kids is hauled off to a precinct house, and the film is at its most effective when it\u2019s conveying the quiet terror of such scenarios. Like so many socially-conscious movies, this one\u2019s schematic nature, the better with which to make its points, shows its hand a little too blatantly at times. While Moussa and Sophie\u2019s stories are well-fleshed-out, Alyssa\u2019s is neglected for the most part, until the very end, at which point it\u2019s used to play a \u201cwhat incredible and sad irony\u201d card. O\u2019Hare\u2019s lawyer, initially a bit of a cartoon, grows in both written dimensionality and portrayal, and the one-on-one scene between him and Chavez-Richmond is an undeniable highlight. \u201cFrom Nowhere\u201d is not a visionary work, and I don\u2019t think it aims to be; but it sets a coherent agenda from the get-go and manages to make a credible and disquieting narrative out of that.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
