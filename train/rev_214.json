{"Title": "The Lovers", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "When you find out that a motion picture has had its title\r\nchanged to the almost magnificently\r\ngeneric \u201cThe Lovers\u201d from a rather less plain but still\r\nnot-exactly-staggeringly-original \u201cSingularity,\u201d you know that a post-production\r\nconceptual shift of some magnitude has occurred. And post-production is pretty\r\nmuch the last part of the filmmaking process in which to introduce that kind of\r\nshift.  Not to get too inside-baseball, but sometimes there\u2019s a very\r\ngood reason that certain movies get stealthy on-demand releases during what\r\nindustry members frequently refer to as \u201cdumping season.\u201d This very unfortunate\r\nfilm, directed by Roland Joff\u00e9 from his own script (the story is from Indian\r\nscreenwriter Ajey Jhankar), opens with some deep-sea diving action that recalls\r\nJames Cameron\u2019s \u201cTitanic\u201d; as does the quest of the divers in question: they\r\nare pursuing a particular artifact. In any\r\nevent, one of the divers is stuck, and so team commander Josh Hartnett goes\r\ndown to rescue her (she\u2019s his wife...oh, wait, now all of a sudden it\u2019s \u201cThe\r\nAbyss\u201d) and in so doing almost drowns. Once Hartnett\u2019s character from our-not-too-distant-future\r\n(lots of blue lighting and a sleek futuristic vehicle are the most prominent\r\nvisual signifiers of this time frame) flounders on life support, the movie goes\r\nback in time several hundred years, to India in the late 1700s, where a British\r\ncaptain named James Stewart (really!) also played by Hartnett, is engaged in a\r\nlot of challenging-to-follow martial intrigue that leads him into a doomed\r\nromance with a regal warrior woman played by Bipasha Basu, one of the premiere\r\nleading ladies of Bollywood.  Advertisement The scenic cinematography by Ben Nott is often beautiful,\r\nwhich distracts, at times, from the fact that the storyline is both convoluted\r\nin the most gratuitous way possible and that it\u2019s enacted in the most\r\nunengaging way imaginable. Every now and then one will be shaken awake by some\r\nof the most stultifying clich\u00e9d dialogue concocted in all of narrative movie\r\nhistory, to wit:  \u201cTell me of this Captain Stewart.\u201d \u201cHe is a leader of men.\u201d \u201cHe inspires love in our people?\u201d \u201cSome people say so, father. \u201c \u201cThen it will benefit us to arrange his death.\u201d During an earlier exchange at a large table, some pompous\r\nbad guys conspire and contemplate getting over on the ostensibly good people\r\nthey require cooperation from: \u201cThe vast sum of money involved will mollify\r\ntheir scruples,\u201d says one, and there\u2019s haw-hawing all around. Little bits such\r\nas these are the only things the movie offers to rouse a viewer from a stupor;\r\nthen again, some of the sounds of stabbing during the movie\u2019s occasional\r\nbreakouts of martial violence are very ripe and wet and loud, which is also\r\nnoteworthy; in every other respect, watching \u201cThe Lovers\u201d is only a noteworthy\r\nexperience for the way the movie just evanesces as it goes on. For all the\r\nexpense of the production, it offers practically nothing in the way of either\r\nemotional or intellectual engagement, and once the viewer is finished with\r\ntrying to care about the plot, the only remaining question is why the film was\r\nmade.\u00a0 My conclusion was that it had something to do with expected box office\r\nreturns in an international market, what with Basu toplining the cast;\r\nunfortunately for her, she looks pretty haggard throughout and is given little\r\nopportunity to extend the charisma that made her a star on her continent.\r\nSimilarly, Hartnett seems only to strike poses and draw blanks. I have not\r\nexpected much of anything from Joff\u00e9 as a director since\u2026well, ever, really, as\r\nhis only entirely watchable film, 1984\u2019s \u201cThe Killing Fields,\u201d had such a\r\nstrong story and cast that Joff\u00e9\u2019s refined-yet-lead-footed directorial approach\r\ncouldn\u2019t kill it. If you think you have fond memories of \u201cThe Mission,\u201d I\r\nrespectfully suggest it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t looked at it again in a while: I\r\nhave, and it\u2019s a drag. As has been everything after that. \u201cThe Lovers\u201d is both\r\nworse and perhaps better than a drag: it\u2019s a tranquilizer.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
