{"Title": "Exposed", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"I think I wanna be the kind of role model that brings\r\npeople back to the time before the fruit of knowledge was eaten,\" the\r\nnouveau-burlesque artist Julie Atlas Muz says at the very beginning of \"Exposed,\"\r\na documentary that manages to be jaw-droppingly provocative and genuinely\r\nendearing\u2014sometimes at alternating points, and by the end kind of all at once. \"Exposed\"\r\nportrays a number of artists, mostly New York based, working in burlesque, or\r\nrather a largely nouveau form of it. A form of performance art that takes a\r\nbunch of the ingredients and accoutrements of conventional burlesque and pushes\r\nthem much farther than you'd imagine. And the movie also constitutes something\r\nof a \"wanna bet?\" challenge to a viewer who believes he or she can\r\nimagine plenty.  Advertisement Directed by Beth B, who made a name for herself as a\r\npost-punk NYC DIY filmmaker in the early '80s, \"Exposed' begins as a kind\r\nof conventional talking head doc that eventually reveals the remarkable layers\r\nof its subjects while never really breaking out of its standard firm, which\r\neventually serves as a potential anchoring device for the viewer. Seeing a\r\ntight close-up of Mat Fraser, who has the rough-hewn handsomeness of a young\r\nMartin Amis type and a slightly plumy British accent to match, creates one\r\nimpression; when footage of his stage show reveals his tiny arms and\r\nflipper-like hands, there's a bit of a shock, and it's entirely deliberate I\r\nthink. Initially Beth B. shows us the \"normal;\" she then reveals the\r\ndifference; and then she spends the rest of the movie unifying the two,\r\nprovided the viewer is willing to go along for the ride.  Fraser's situation is the one that has the most immediate\r\nvisual impact, but all of the performers here are taking burlesque and\r\nultra-X-rated vaudeville as a vehicle to explore their own issues and concerns\r\nabout gender and identity. World Famous BOB and Rose Wood, for instance, are biologically\r\nfemale and male respectively, but the representations they create on stage, and\r\nhow these relate to their interactions in the \"real\" world, both past\r\nand present, are both complex and poignant. One of the subjects of the movie\r\ndefines burlesque as an \"immediate, honest, and sometimes brutal art form,\"\r\nand the shock tactics these performers incorporate into a context that had\r\nheretofore been defined as completely frivolous is not just a matter of spicing\r\nup \"entertainment\" but also pursuing self-realization. An upscale\r\ndrinking spot like The Glass Slipper becomes a conduit for activism when\r\ntransformed by these performers.  This all sounds pretty heavy, and no kidding, it is, but\r\nthere's a great deal of humor here. The movie is as fascinating as it is\r\nconcise\u2014its running time is only about 80 minutes\u2014and it is probably best\r\nexperienced as part of a larger event at which its subjects actually perform,\r\nwhich is how the movie's being marketed in part. Still. It ought to be said,\r\nmuch of what is depicted here is not for the easily shaken. If you associate \"burlesque\"\r\nexclusively with Natalie Wood's striptease scene in \"Gypsy,\" take a\r\nstep back.

Genitalia\r\nis displayed, then tugged, pulled, smushed, smeared with lipstick, and much,\r\nmuch more. Imagine the notorious windshield-sex scene from \"The Counselor,\"\r\nonly shot from inside the car. Okay, matters do not get entirely that graphic,\r\nbut pretty close. You have been warned. If you think you're up for it, then go\r\nfor it; \"Exposed\" will take you to a realm you might not have known\r\neven existed.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
