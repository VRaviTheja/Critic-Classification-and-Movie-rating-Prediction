{"Title": "Let's Be Evil", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Adepts of tech Newspeak will immediately recognize the title\r\nof this movie as an unsubtle play on Google\u2019s in-house corporate ethos slogan,\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil.\u201d Not the cleverest usurpation of a concept, and the movie,\r\ndirected and written by Martin Owen from \u201can original idea\u201d (so original it\r\ngets its own opening credit card) by executive producer Jonathan Willis,\r\nsteadily maintains that lack throughout. Not a great thing if your aim is to\r\nmake a satirically pointed sci-fi horror movie.  At least that\u2019s what I think this thing was supposed to be.\r\nAfter a badly staged simulation of an issue-driven chat show, in which an\r\nagitated male predicts a generation of uneducated obese kids, the movie cuts to\r\na scene out of one of those debt-consolidation television commercials. A stack\r\nof envelopes with \u201cPast Due\u201d stamped in red sits atop the blond faux\r\nwood grain of a generic kitchen table. An ailing older woman is seen through an\r\nopen bedroom door, and a young woman outside that door takes a phone call, while\r\nher computer screen silently shows the music video for Kim Wilde\u2019s \u201cKids in\r\nAmerica.\u201d 1994, what a year that was. Why this Millennial, named Jenny, has\r\nmuch interest in it is a question that will, sort of, be addressed. Non-cleverly.\r\nThe phone call is for a job prospect\u2014ah, overdue-bill problem perhaps\r\nsolved!\u2014at something called the Posterity Project. Jenny (Elizabeth Morris, one\r\nof the film\u2019s co-writers) eagerly makes the appointment, only to meet with\r\nobfuscation once inside the designated building. The \u201cthere\u2019s no Posterity Project\u201d here bit\r\nis the first of several something-is-happening-but-she-don\u2019t-know-what-it-is\r\njabs to which the movie never ends up delivering meaningful follow-ups.

This being the, or an, ostensible solution\r\nto the fat-kid problem the fellow in the opening scene was ranting about. All\r\nthe participants in the program wear virtual reality glasses, and much of the\r\nfilm is shot via the point of view of the characters wearing the gizmos, which\r\nallows the frame to be filled with semi-fancy computer graphics and also means\r\nthe cinematographer doesn\u2019t have to make a lot of different lens choices. Jenny\u2019s\r\ncolleagues are Tiggs (Kara Tointon)\u2014who prefers the diminutive to her given name, which is\r\nAntigone, and hold on, it gets worse\u2014a perky/feisty young woman, and Darby (Eliot James Langridge), a\r\nguy with one of those au courant post-Nazi shaved-side haircuts who\u2019s so surly\r\nand anti social it\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019d get past an interview for a gig\r\nmopping up at White Castle, but whatever. This trio\u2019s challenge is to look\r\nafter a group of busy-interacting-with-air (because augmented reality and\r\neverything) young geniuses, including one named Cassandra (Isabelle Allen). (I told you it gets\r\nworse.) Shepherding the recruits is Ariel (Jamie Bernadette), who\u2019s kind of like Siri with a\r\nvisual component. All the ingredients are here, I guess, for an involving and\r\ntricky thriller in which actual reality opposes itself to computer-driven\r\nreality, not to mention all the potential for social commentary such a scenario\r\nengenders. David Cronenberg springs to mind, as do the post-nuke \u201cspecial\u201d\r\nchildren bred and trained in Joseph Losey\u2019s early \u201860s \u201cThe Damned.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s Be\r\nEvil\u201d does not get within swinging, spitting, or any kind of distance of those\r\naforementioned films. There\u2019s no reliable conceptual framework, no actual\r\nopposition between villain and protagonist, not much of anything but the\r\ncomputer graphics, the flickering lights and eventual blackouts and\r\ncrawl-through-the-ventilation scares that worked a lot better in the likes of\r\n\u201cDemons 2\u201d than they do here. The movie\u2019s relentless one-note tone makes its\r\nfinal twist, such as it is, entirely predictable and pat. I was surprised to see\r\nthat this picture had an unrolling at this year\u2019s Slamdance Film Festival,\r\nwhere once upon a time pictures such as Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cFollowing\u201d and\r\nJonathan Weiss\u2019 \u201cThe Atrocity Exhibition\u201d unspooled. Standards are sinking\r\neverywhere these days, it seems.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
