{"Title": "The Homesman", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The journey in Tommy Lee Jones' \"The Homesman\", based on the 1988 novel \r\nby Glendon Swarthout, travels from west to east, from the unmarked \r\nNebraska territory to a town in Iowa. It is a reverse trajectory of the \r\ntypical Western path, the wildness of the prairies and plains reverting,\r\n startlingly, to a tame village perched on the edge of the placid \r\nMissouri River. When civilization finally arrives in the final section \r\nof the film, it seems palpably fragile; what has come before is so \r\nunremittingly desolate.  Advertisement \"The Homesman,\" despite the title, is about \r\nwomen. Women are the center of the action, women drive the action \r\nforward, women are not only damsels in distress but heroic figures of \r\ngrit and courage (sometimes in the same moment). The men are helpless \r\nbystanders or ambiguous allies. There is only one villain in the film, \r\nand he is a villain because he is callous. He lacks empathy. Tommy Lee \r\nJones, as a director, homes in on the surreal aspects of the story with \r\nbeautiful sensitivity and strangeness (\"The Homesman\" is an extremely \r\nstrange film), highlighting the monotony of the landscape in which \r\nfigures are either dwarfed by the vastness of it or tower above the flat\r\n horizon. The West, as seen in \"The Homesman,\" is an unforgiving place, \r\nwith flashes of stark and nightmarish beauty. Three women have lost \r\ntheir minds in \"The Homesman,\" but honestly, everyone you meet in the \r\nfilm is slightly crazy, the homesman most of all. Nobody is a pillar of \r\nmental health. Sanity, then, could be seen as overrated, especially in a\r\n world like the one in \"The Homesman.\" And those who lose their minds \r\nmay very well be the only realists in the story. These are deeply \r\nsuggestive ideas, and when \"The Homesman\" works best it teeters around \r\nin that morally ambiguous territory. It's a risky film. Sometimes the \r\nrisks pay off, sometimes they don't, but the feeling of risk infuses the\r\n film with chaos, humor, violence, beauty. \"The Homesman\" doesn't play \r\nthings safe, and that's a welcome change. \r\nMary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) is a middle-aged woman, born in upstate \r\nNew York, who has bought land in the Nebraska territory. She is \r\nunmarried and farms the land herself. She yearns to buy a piano and \r\ncomforts herself by playing hymns on a cloth keyboard. She is seen early\r\n on proposing marriage to a farmer who owns land adjacent to hers. She \r\npitches it as a business proposition, although there is an urgent need \r\nand fragility beneath her words that tell a different story. He turns \r\nher down pretty bluntly: \"You're too bossy and you're too damn plain.\" \r\nIt hurts, it hurts bad, but Mary Bee does not pity herself. She has too \r\nmuch work to do. \r\nDuring the tail-end of a particularly terrible winter, three women in \r\nthe area descend into varying degrees of psychosis, dissociation, \r\nself-harm, and derangement. It is clear that they need to be transported\r\n to a place that can treat them, and the minister (John Lithgow) has a \r\nconnection with a church in Iowa that has agreed to take them in. When \r\nthe menfolk in the congregation balk at the job of transport, Mary Bee \r\ntakes it on. A glorified paddy wagon is provided, complete with iron \r\nrings on the interior in order to chain the women in place, should it be\r\n necessary. The journey will be dangerous and long, and Mary Bee needs to\r\n hire a homesman, and George Briggs, a drunken out-for-himself \r\nclaim-jumper, is just the man for the job. Mary Bee pitches it to him \r\nwith the same matter-of-fact tone that she proposed marriage, telling \r\nhim exactly what she needs and expects, and exactly what she will not \r\ntolerate. He's a bit of a buffoon, in his filthy long-johns and whining \r\nvoice, but he needs the money. Advertisement \r\nThe early introduction of the three madwomen is presented hauntingly by \r\nJones. The images flash onto the screen, interrupting the main action of\r\n Mary Bee at her farm, and Jones crafts a collage of terror and \r\ndread. Gro Svendsen (Sonja Richter) is a Scandinavian woman, seen \r\nscreaming in agony as her husband drags her dead mother out into the \r\nsnowy night: the corpse is stinking, she can't stay in the house \r\nanymore. Arabella (Grace Gummer) is a teenager, with a young husband, \r\nand her three babies died in a matter of days from diphtheria. She has \r\ngone comatose, staring out the window, clutching a rag doll. Theoline \r\n(Miranda Otto) is shown strolling outside into a biting snowstorm, a \r\nwailing purple newborn nipping at her bare breast, and she casually \r\ntosses the baby down the hole in the outhouse; the most harrowing image \r\nin the film. The presentation of madness is both compassionate and \r\nunblinking. \r\nBriggs is a comic figure in the beginning, a drawling and \r\ninappropriately insouciant Walter Brennan-type character, garrulous and \r\ncareless, demanding Mary Bee buy him a jug of whiskey for the ride. The \r\ndynamic between Briggs and pious straight-talking spinster is one of the\r\n pleasures of the film. It almost becomes a classic buddy picture. Both \r\ncharacters are outlaws. Neither of them fit into \"normal\" society. Both \r\nof them are individualists, who value strength, who have strength, but \r\nwho will always be just a little bit on the periphery of accepted norms.\r\n This could be seen as a tragedy for them; it could be seen as a \r\ntriumph. The film does not come down on either side. The situation is \r\nnot \"either/or\". It is \"both/and.\" \r\nThere are confrontations with the elements during the journey; there are\r\n moments when they lose control of the women. One breaks free; one \r\nkicks the other in the face; one is unable or unwilling to handle her own\r\n bodily functions as Briggs lifts her skirt up for her and barks, \"Squat now. Come on. Pee.\" At first wary with one another, and at \r\nsome moments damn near confrontational, Briggs and Mary Bee find that \r\nthey are good partners, tag-teaming the job, and talking at night over \r\nthe crackling fire as the three women lie tied up to the wagon wheels, \r\nasleep or in a daze. Advertisement \r\nFor most of the film, it is Mary Bee's story. She is its anchor, and \r\nBriggs is her sidekick. Something happens three-fourths of the way through that \r\nputs Briggs in the center, as the title character. Having not read the \r\nnovel, the moment came as an enormous surprise, almost shattering the \r\nfabric of the film, as harrowing, in its way, of the vision of the \r\nmother throwing her baby into the privy hole. In thinking back on it, \r\nthere are fragments of behavior shown, glimpses of inner life, that \r\nmakes that moment inevitable, in retrospect. The film expands \r\nexponentially as the formal narrative is destabilized, and things get \r\ndistinctly stranger, although Jones keeps his eye on the overall theme \r\nof madness and survival; trauma and strength. \r\nThe strangest section of the film involves a stop-over at the Fairfield \r\nHotel, standing alone in the middle of the plains, like an Andrew Wyeth \r\npainting, reminiscent of Sam Shepard's house in Terrence \r\nMalick's \"Days of Heaven.\" The smooth-talking Irishman proprietor (James Spader) hopes to \r\nattract investors to this little spot in the middle of nowhere, \r\nsurrounded by sheer emptiness.  So he's a little nuts, too. Beautifully conceived and \r\nshot, the section is a tangent, but it is extremely revealing about \r\nBriggs' character, as well as a sardonic, pointed commentary about the \r\nconcept of civilization. Civilization, as represented by the small \r\nhuddle of farms out in Nebraska, does its best to help those who need \r\nit. Civilization, as represented by the tiny town in Iowa, is kind and \r\ngenteel, although it doesn't quite know what to do with a man like \r\nBriggs. Elsewhere, though, like at the totally empty Fairfield Hotel, \r\nwith its sideboard heaped with luscious food, and its paintings of naked\r\n women in the lobby, civilization is cold and unfeeling. There is an \r\nargument to be made that the only place where someone like Briggs, or \r\nsomeone like Mary Bee, could ever hope to \"fit in\" is out there in the \r\nunmarked territories, cutting their way into the land, relying only on \r\nthemselves, a landscape where eccentricity is an asset. \r\nJones' visual style is simple and clean, and cinematographer Rodrigo \r\nPrieto finds some gorgeous John Ford touches; people shown in black \r\nsilhouette through barn doorways, or house doorways, with the vast \r\nbright landscape beyond, a clear demarcation between interior and \r\nexterior, displaying the individual against the sheer size of the land out there. \r\nThere's a section where Mary Bee gets separated from the wagon and \r\nwanders the plains through the dark night on her horse, disoriented and \r\nlost, calling out for Briggs, resorting to chewing on grass like a feral\r\n creature. These dark sequences have the hallucinatory quality of a \r\nnightmare. Advertisement \r\nNovelist Glendon Swarthout was interested in unlikely characters who \r\nhave to show extraordinary courage and strength. He was interested in \r\nthe moral ambiguities of familiar genres. The best example of this comes\r\n in his most famous book, \"Bless the Beasts and the \r\nChildren\" (which has never gone out of print since it was \r\npublished in 1971). \"Bless the Beasts and the Children\"\r\n tells the story of a group of misfit kids who have been sent to a boys'\r\n home/dude ranch in the American Southwest. Turned into a film in 1972, \r\ndirected by Stanley Kramer, it takes the age-old themes of the Western \r\n(man vs. nature, man vs. the landscape, man vs. himself) and pours it \r\ninto the service of a modern coming-of-age drama. \"The Homesman,\" like \r\n\"Bless the Beasts\" questions the \"norm\". It asks questions about what \r\nstrength looks like (in men and in women), and also what strength might \r\nactually mean, what it signifies. Holding a rifle on an enemy requires \r\nstrength. So does being kind and caring to someone who has descended \r\ninto psychosis. Jones puts all of those elements on a level playing \r\nfield. Women are misfits here because of their biology. Biology could be\r\n seen as an enemy: motherhood is wonderful, but terrible when your \r\ninfant triplets all die on the same day. And what of those, like Mary \r\nBee, who have been denied the \"natural\" outlet for women, through \r\nwifehood and motherhood? What does biology mean then? \r\nThe final section of the film is suddenly conventional, and represents a\r\n confused petering-out of strength, a tame meandering coda to the \r\nchaotic thrust of the story. It's almost like \"The Homesman,\" barreling \r\nalong at a high speed, powerful and weird and funny and terrible, hits \r\nan invisible speed bump all of a sudden, and the pieces fly apart. But \r\nthe conventional coda cannot erase the risk-filled pleasure of all that \r\ncame before.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
