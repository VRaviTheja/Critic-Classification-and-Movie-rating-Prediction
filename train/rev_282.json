{"Title": "A Cure for Wellness", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "I keep forgetting the title of \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d and calling it \u201cThe Color of Despair.\u201d It\u2019s an accurate mistake. As directed by Gore Verbinski (\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" \"The Lone Ranger\"), this film about a New York financial wiz (Dane DeHaan) getting trapped in a creepy Swiss clinic wants to be sickly-dreamy horror epic. It\u2019s a black-and-white movie done in color. Bojan Bazelli's stark photography\u00a0 creates pools of blackness and acres of negative space. Jenny Beavan\u2019s retro-gothic costuming and Eve Stewart\u2019s production design favor ash, bone, eggshell, curdled cream, and shades of green ranging from bile to moss. If you could nick a David Fincher film\u2019s throat, hang it upside down, and bleed it for two days, it would look like this movie. As a fetish object, it\u2019s impressive. Advertisement But as a fully satisfying feature-length drama, it\u2019s a bust. And it\u2019s iffy as a visionary spectacle, too, because it\u2019s too long and over-scaled, and its control of tone and theme never matches the care that has been lavished on its production. This is all a shame, because there\u2019s much to admire in \u201cA Cure for Wellness.\u201d DeHaan has just the right look to play the main character, Lockhart, a corrupt young East Coast WASP who travels to Switzerland to find a missing company executive but ends up trapped at a \u201cwellness clinic\u201d run by a German-accented doctor named Heinrich Volmer (Jason Issacs). DeHaan looks like he could be Dylan Baker\u2019s long lost son, all milky angularity and cold stares. He has that look that casting directors go for when they\u2019re hiring prep school jerks or Nazi youth. The actor\u2019s straightforward performance, by turns entitled, baffled, terrified and ashamed, makes Lockhart a punching-bag hero, the kind who exists mainly to suffer horribly before achieving an enlightenment that looks a lot like comeuppance. Lockhart is insufferable at first because he\u2019s supposed to be. There\u2019s a sense in which he deserves the miseries inflicted upon him because he\u2019s a snotty capitalist swine who would otherwise grow up to be another Ebenezer Scrooge, and he\u2019s representing a system that produces Scrooges by the millions. Verbinski and screenwriter Justin Haythe (\u201cRevolutionary Road,\u201d \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d) seem at times to be making a statement about the vampire-like hold that the cultural memory of Europe still has over many rich and powerful Americans. Lockhart\u2019s predecessor went to the clinic \u201cto take in the waters\u201d\u2014which, as another character notes, is a very nineteenth century thing to do\u2014and the all-white denizens of the place seem awed by the very existence of Volmer, a handsome gadfly who has the chiseled looks of an old movie Gestapo officer but carries himself like an ambassador of reason. The clinic grounds are a replica of an identical place that burned down decades ago on this very spot\u2014there\u2019s a backstory involving taboo hideousness\u2014and there are recurring situations that pivot on insularity, hatred of outsiders, and the purity of bloodlines. (Mia Goth, who plays the doctor\u2019s daughter, is the ultimate expression of the film\u2019s anemic vision: she looks haunted and starved yet somehow also glamorous.) This is a fine starting place for a social satire and also a fine thematic flavor for a compact, dreamy horror movie. There are real ideas here, good ideas even, but they remain tantalizing but insufficiently shaped. It\u2019s only during the last half-hour\u2014a succession of over-the-top set-pieces that I loved, and that many colleagues found trashy and excessive\u2014that \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d attains the level of bug-nuts wildness that it possibly needed all along. Verbinski isn\u2019t bad at psychological and atmospheric horror, but he\u2019s often at his most original when he\u2019s letting it all hang out in sequences of clockwork suspense and ridiculous action, which is why the slapstick sequences in the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movies, the chases in \u201cRango\u201d and the last 45 minutes of \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d represent Verbinski at his most Verbinskian. It\u2019s in the maybe narratively-unnecessary final half-hour that \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d finally starts drawing the kinds of connections (through sheer excess) that give it a distinctive personality, such as a cut from a decadent, repulsive character whirling in circles after sustaining an injury to a group of clueless rich folk waltzing in a grand ballroom. Advertisement And the two-and-a-half hour running time is too much even by standards of too-muchness. It\u2019s ironic and unfortunate that the movie models so much of its look on German Expressionist silent movies and 1930s Universal horror films, because those tended to be short and lean. Very long horror movies often reach a point of diminishing returns no matter how skillfully the filmmakers sustain a mood\u2014\u201cThe Shining\u201d is a rare exception, though even that one has detractors\u2014because they give you time to think about the concept and fixate on plot holes, judgment errors and other imperfections. Verbinski is no Stanley Kubrick, although there are moments when he comes close. There are sequences involving eels that make eels seem even creepier than they did already, and a dentistry-as-torture scene that makes the one in \u201cMarathon Man\u201d look like a routine cleaning. I could easily imagine a version of \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d that\u2019s all suggestion and understatement, and one that\u2019s essentially the madcap finale played out of the length of a feature, climbing to nosebleed heights of bad taste and unfurling a freak flag at the summit. Either would have been preferable to what ended up onscreen, a rag-and-bone shop of notions. What\u2019s most conspicuously absent here is Kubrick\u2019s lordly, even naughty sense of humor. \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d aims for black comedy often, but rarely manages anything more sophisticated than the sick joke comic rhythm of, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing that could happen to this character?\u201d followed by, \u201cHere it comes.\u201d Lockhart\u2019s suffering grows dull through repetition. He keeps brushing up against the same realizations, onto be lied to or misdirected and find himself back where he started. Too much of this sort of thing and even patient viewers throw their hands up and moan, \u201cOh, come on.\u201d Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
