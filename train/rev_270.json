{"Title": "Flatliners", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Deep in the bowels of a university's medical school, a group of students intentionally kill themselves for minutes at a time to experience what lies beyond. This is a fabulous idea for a movie, but unfortunately \"Flatliners\"\u00a0represents the second failed attempt to do it justice. It's not a terrible film, and neither was the original. They're both frustratingly not terrible: the cast acts the hell out of every moment, struggling to find profundity in situations that are conceived in the most superficial way, often settling for cheap horror movie jolts and \"it was only a dream\" false alarms, and things wrap up so neatly that the sense of wonder and terror inherent in the story remains largely untapped.\u00a0 Advertisement Joel Schumacher's 1990 original was a surprise hit, starring a cast of soon-to-be-huge stars, including Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland, who has a supporting role here; but its premise, which could have opened the door to a visionary work of\u00a0sci-fi horror, settled into a sort of gothic self-help drama groove, with the medical students realizing that the seemingly supernatural\u00a0goings-on triggered by their experiments in \"flatlining\" were\u00a0manifestations of their past misdeeds.\u00a0Director\u00a0Niels Arden Oplev\u2019s remake,\u00a0adapted by Ben Ripley from Peter Filardi's\u00a0original script, sticks to that template, changing key details here and there while embracing a style that stirs every current horror movie visual cliche into a jagged paste.\u00a0 Ellen Page stars as Dr. Courtney Holmes, whose kid sister died in a car accident years ago due to her negligence. She corrals a group of fellow residents\u2014Diego Luna's earnest and responsible Ray, Nina Dobrev's flirty\u00a0hardcore Marlo, James Norton's rich kid Casanova Jamie, Kiersey Clemons' stressed-out and mommy-dominated Sophia\u2014to administer heart-stopping drugs to kill her for three minutes and heart paddles to wake her back up so that she can report what she saw. She experiences a sensation of flying and sees angles on the campus and the city that she's\u00a0never personally experienced. This is enough to\u00a0convince her colleagues\u2014except for the\u00a0cautious and ethical Ray,\u00a0who's there mainly to guard against tragedy\u2014to undergo the same treatment.\u00a0 But then (ominous bass fiddles!) mysterious things start to happen. Courtney is visited by an\u00a0apparition that's obviously\u00a0connected to her feelings of guilt over her sister's death. In short order, Jamie, Marlo and Sophia all begin experiencing creepy events and disturbing visions. By the time the movie reaches its midpoint, there's no question of where the film has to go before the credits roll. \u00a0 Fully 20 percent of the movie's\u00a0running time consists of\u00a0characters wandering along through dark apartments,\u00a0basements and corridors, wondering if the\u00a0noises they hear\u00a0are just their imaginations while out-of-focus shapes and faces dart through the\u00a0negative space nearby. Sometimes these shocks are\u00a0amplified by a\u00a0shriek of atonal soundtrack music, and once in a while you'll get a jolt of graphic violence that rarely has any long-term consequences. The whole thing is too much of a tease, and once you figure that out, there's no actual suspense to speak of, just momentary\u00a0manipulations. Advertisement The cast gives the movie everything they've got. Luna and Page in particular make much stronger\u00a0impressions than you might\u00a0expect, given the repetitious and mostly shallow scenarios they're asked to enact, and there are a couple of moments\u00a0near the end where Sophia's story snaps into focus and finds just the right\u00a0balance between inspirational\u00a0melodrama and horror that otherwise eludes the movie. But the choppy, cliched visuals and the script's superficial approach to the characters' predicaments (people are constantly\u00a0stating the obvious to each other, and to the audience)\u00a0ultimately undo any goodwill that the actors can generate.\u00a0 This sort of movie can be more frustrating than a maliciously terrible\u00a0or blunderingly incompetent film because at each step you can tell that everyone involved in the production sincerely\u00a0believed in the material, both as raucous\u00a0entertainment and as a tale of moral growth. But when the best you can say about a movie is that it means well, that's proof that it's\u00a0not working on any level that matters.", "Critic": "Delta"}
