{"Title": "Old Fashioned", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "This sensitive, competently crafted indie picture\u2014a\r\ngenuinely regional film, it would appear, shot in Ohio and set up through a\r\nproduction company based in Grand Rapids, Michigan\u2014is a romance that\u2019s aiming\r\nto play David against this week\u2019s ostensible date-movie Goliath, the\r\nconsiderably not hearts-and-flowers-redolent \u201cFifty Shades Of Grey.\u201d Written,\r\ndirected by, and starring Rik Swartzwelder, \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d kind of wears its\r\npremise on its title. Spunky sweet, and smart Amber (Elizabeth Roberts) runs\r\nout of gas in the middle of a picture-perfect town in which Clay (Swartzwelder)\r\nhones various crafts at an antique store called, yep, \u201cOld Fashioned.\u201d Amber\u2019s\r\nresolve, such as it was, was to drive until she ran out of gas and set up\r\nhousekeeping wherever that happened to be. Clay helps her set up in a new\r\nquaintly furnished apartment but won\u2019t go through the screen door outside. He\r\nhas made a vow, he tells Amber: he won\u2019t be alone in a room with a woman who\r\nisn\u2019t his wife. Amber finds this odd. She finds it odder when she learns he\u2019s\r\nnot married.  Advertisement Clay\u2019s back-story is revealed in dribs and drabs: this is\r\nnot quite \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin\u201d played straight. The hero was not just a\r\ncollegiate ladies\u2019 man but a bit of a Joe Francis type as well, producing\r\nsalacious videos. Then he changed. \u201cYou found Jesus?\u201d Amber asks him. \u201cMore\r\nlike\u2026he found me,\u201d Clay responds. So, yes, this \u201cFifty Shades\u201d-counter-programming isn\u2019t\r\nkidding around about being counter-programming. But I would not necessarily\r\ncharacterize this effort as a \u201cChristian movie,\u201d not that there\u2019s anything\r\nwrong with that. Swartzwelder does a very thorough and not unbalanced job of\r\nportraying Christian characters trying to function in a social milieu that\r\ndiscourages values such as chastity, modesty, and so on. The movie tries hard\r\nnot to be overtly prudish about its point of view, and in many respects it\r\nsucceeds\u2014I didn\u2019t even notice until after it was over that it had no swearing\r\nin its dialogue. Once Clay explains his chaste theory of courtship to Amber,\r\nand Amber agrees to make a go of it, \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d also has no problem owning\r\nup to the fact that Clay\u2019s quest to be \u201ca decent person\u201d is in fact more than a\r\nlittle dogmatic. He\u2019s depicted as defensive and even a little hostile in terms\r\nof the ways he stands up for his beliefs. Amber\u2019s more conventionally\r\n\u201cfree-spirited,\u201d but within that context she\u2019s got more sense than Clay, as\r\ndoes Clay\u2019s adorable wise aunt Zella (Dorothy Silver). Near the climax of the\r\npicture, when Amber and Clay argue about the idea of forgiveness, Clay sniffs\r\n\u201cYou make it sound so easy,\u201d and Amber shoots him down good with \u201cYou make it\r\nsound impossible.\u201d It\u2019s incredibly rare to see an American movie with a\r\nChristian perspective that\u2019s more invested in philosophizing and empathizing\r\nthan in eschatological pandering, and for that alone \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d deserves\r\ncommendation. The movie\u2019s also very well acted and beautifully shot. However, Swartzwelder does tend to lay things on a little\r\nthick. There\u2019s a scene in which a character gets a poster for the Frank Capra\r\nfilm \u201cMeet John Doe\u201d as a present, which is all well and good, but then the\r\nviewer is subjected to a reprise of Gary Cooper\u2019s climactic speech at the end\r\nof the film along with a few sensitive dissolves of small-town-America imagery.\r\nOne of the jarring voices of modernity is a local radio DJ whose show\r\napparently consists entirely of misogynist rants; you know, most local radio\r\nstations, even the most talk-oriented, do provide weather reports every now and\r\nthen. I mentioned the cinematography before; it\u2019s by David George, and it\u2019s\r\nlovely, but every now and again Swartzwelder and his editors string together\r\nseveral of said images for interludes that could be characterized as\r\n\u201cMalick-lite.\u201d This speaks, finally, to the movie\u2019s most substantial flaw,\r\nwhich is that with respect to pacing, Swartzwelder, going for \u201cthoughtful,\u201d instead\r\nachieves \u201cglacial.\u201d A romance wants to sweep viewers up, not bog them down.\r\nStill, \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d is both unusual and intelligent enough that, despite it not being entirely MY cup of tea, I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019ll succeed at doing at\r\nleast a little more than addressing the converted.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
