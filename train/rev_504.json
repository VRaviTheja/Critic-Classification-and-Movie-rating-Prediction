{"Title": "Marshall", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The 1940s legal thriller \u201cMarshall\u201d is a solid drama that gives viewers a glimpse into an alternate universe\u2014one where African-American actors could be treated as old school movie stars, in period pieces that are less concerned with giving audiences a solemn, Oscar-baiting history lesson than an entertaining story that happens to be drawn from life.\u00a0 Chadwick Boseman, Hollywood\u2019s go-to guy for playing important Black Americans, adds another icon to his gallery: NAACP attorney and future Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, a New Yorker dispatched to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to defend a black man, Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown), who stands accused of the rape and attempted murder of a white society woman, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). Filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (\u201cHouse Party,\u201d \u201cBoomerang\u201d) adapts a script by the father-son screenwriting team of Michael and Jacob Koskoff that jumps off from a real case. Many of the most seemingly outrageous twists are pulled from the record.  Advertisement One is a decision by the sitting judge (James Cromwell), an imperious old white man who doesn\u2019t appreciate having a cocky black New Yorker in his court, to turn Marshall into a mute bystander by declaring that only attorneys licensed to practice law in Connecticut can argue before his bench. This feels like an early checkmate intended to send Spell straight to prison: the NAACP only assigned Marshall to Bridgeport in the first place because the white majority had already made up its mind about Spell\u2019s guilt and no local lawyers would take his case.\u00a0 And so the  hero is forced to use his co-counsel, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), an insurance lawyer who\u2019s never tried a criminal case before, as a sock puppet. He works out details of their strategy behind the scenes, then guides Friedman during jury selection and opening arguments via handwritten notes, facial reactions, and irritated sighs and grunts. From here, \u201cMarshall\u201d turns into a mismatched buddy film, of a kind that we\u2019ve never seen before. Although Boseman is 100% credible as a brilliant attorney, especially when Marshall and Friedman are trying to work around the judge\u2019s restrictions, his performance as Marshall is not an imitation; nor is it overly concerned with giving us a true psychological portrait of Thurgood Marshall the man. It\u2019s more of a classic Hollywood alpha male badass performance, in the vein of Humphrey Bogart, Paul Newman, and other 20th\u00a0century white superstars who reveled in playing\u00a0sarcastic, sexy,\u00a0domineering jerks, but were so exciting to watch\u2014whether orating, listening, smoking a cigarette in a jazz club, or just wearing an impeccably tailored suit and walking from point A to point B\u2014that you enjoyed them no matter what their characters\u00a0did. This Thurgood Marshall is so accomplished at such a young age\u2014having already argued his first U.S. Supreme Court case, and claimed Langston Hughes (Jussie Smollett) and Zora Neale Hurston (Chilli) as drinking buddies\u2014that when he arrives in Bridgeport he offhandedly orders Friedman to help him with his bags, then pokes fun at him and plays head-games with him every chance he gets. (Apparently the latter is an actual Thurgood Marshall trait: he was suspended twice from Pennsylvania\u2019s Lincoln University for pranks and hazing.) He's a bit of a bastard at times. But just when you start to worry that \u201cMarshall\u201d is about to settle into a repetitious groove, with a know-it-all hero solving a nebbish\u2019s problems, the full force of the town\u2019s majority starts to weigh on the duo, freighting their work with paranoia and fear of violence. What follows is a humbling experience for both men. \u201cMarshall\u201d is not a soup-to-nuts biography of one of the most significant figures in U.S. legal history, but a legal potboiler dependent on teamwork. It\u00a0pays attention to issues of racial, religious and gender discrimination without wavering from its main objective: giving us an entertaining film about a couple of guys who are in way over their heads. Advertisement One of the movie\u2019s most intriguing qualities is the way that it shows how power and respect vary depending on what room you\u2019re in, and who\u2019s in it with you. Marshall moseys into Bridgeport as if he\u2019s wearing an invisible cape, but in court, in the city jail, at home with his wife Buster (Keesha Sharp), and in Harlem nightspots with cultural giants, he is diminished, by his own choice or against his will; we perceive him differently, and he perceives himself differently. When Marshall is face-to-face with brawny white men who hate him on sight, the movie sharply reminds us that there are situations where college degrees aren't worth the paper they're printed on. A less frightening but equally dispiriting scene finds Marshall speaking to a black lawyer in Bridgeport who passed the bar but was denied a license to practice law because of his race. Friedman, too, seems like a different person depending on what room he\u2019s in. Marshall\u2019s swagger and awesome legal track record intimidate him, but his own younger brother and law partner idolizes and defers to him, and it\u2019s obvious that in Bridgeport\u2019s Jewish community he\u2019s a man of influence, respected in large part because he has the nerve to accept challenges that others run from. There\u2019s a marvelous moment in a synagogue men\u2019s room where a member of the congregation seems as if he\u2019s about to insult Friedman for representing an accused \u201cschwarze\u201d rapist, then slips some cash into Friedman's jacket pocket. Both Boseman and Gad do a superb job of ratcheting their characters\u2019 physical confidence up and down by degrees, depending on the circumstances. This gives the movie a richer sense of time and place than you might have expected. It also draws parallels between the experience of Jews and blacks in 1940s America that come to fruition in the movie's final summation. Hudlin and his writers pander a bit at times. Too many important moments are spelled out in dialogue even though images and performances have already explained what\u2019s at stake; some of the twists are too predictable,\u00a0and in the last third, especially, you may start to suspect that the film is playing fast and loose with the historical record to create a more superficially exciting story. (Although I knew Thurgood Marshall could write a dissenting opinion for the ages, his street-fighting skill was news to me.) Advertisement But the movie\u2019s missteps and over-reaches are all of a piece. The farther away from the courtroom we get, the more \u201cMarshall\u201d starts to feel like a detective thriller with subtle Western movie accents: the terse, one-word title positions its hero as a tough, smart sheriff trying to clean up a corrupt town. There\u2019s an almost B-movie quality to certain parts\u2014a touch of \u201cShaft\u201d\u2014and I mean that as praise. What I like most about Marshall the man and \u201cMarshall\u201d the film are their laid back confidence. It carries itself as if we\u2019ve already seen a lot of projects like this one\u2014as if there\u2019s a new funny, exciting period piece about a brilliant, two-fisted black lawyer in theaters every week, and this is just the latest. I hope the filmmakers are already working on \u201cMarshall Returns.\u201d", "Critic": "Delta"}
