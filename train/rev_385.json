{"Title": "The New Radical", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Over the past hundred years, revolutionaries have gotten more and more disappointing. Back in 1917, Vladimir Ulyanov, aka Lenin, really delivered the goods in terms of regime change. Yes, I know that the replacement of Tsarist was a disaster\u2014I\u2019ve read The Great Terror, and more\u2014but, you know. Then there was Mao, and that was another spectacular overturning followed by another spectacular round of atrocities. May 1968 yielded a revolutionary type that spawned the Green movement, a mere political party. In the U.S., Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin proved mere counterculture showmen even after they took important free-speech stances in the wake of the riots at Chicago\u2019s Democratic National Convention. Advertisement In the 21st\u00a0century, the ostensible revolutionary has ostensibly loosed himself from the shackles of right or left wing ideology\u2014although as we have seen, or shall see, a lot of these figures are fascists in anarchist clothing. Directed by Adam Bhala Lough, \u201cThe New Radical\u201d begins with a profile of Cody Wilson, a Millennial who invented a 3D-printable gun he cheekily called \u201cThe Liberator.\u201d On a clip from some show on Glenn Beck\u2019s media platform \u201cThe Blaze,\u201d Beck asks the youthful, occasionally beardo-ish bro Wilson, \u201cAre you a hero or a villain?\u201d To which Wilson replies, \u201cGood question.\u201d Much is made throughout the movie of Wilson\u2019s prodigious intellect. \u201cMy mother and father met in the same county,\u201d he wistfully recalls, before revealing his father was, besides being a pastor, a professor of hermeneutics. Wilson cites John Milton\u2019s Arepoditica\u00a0as a touchstone text in the development of his PHILOSOPHY OF FREEDOM, and tells cool stories containing passages like \u201cExam week was here and the State Department shut me down.\u201d He casually drops apercus like \u201cInformation should be free. And it wants to be.\u201d He shares heaviness like \u201cWikileaks was about showing that the Internet is the only game in town.\u201d Faced again with the hero-or-villain question, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t like the dichotomy. Whose conception? What paradigm?\u201d There\u2019s nothing intellectually intimidating, or even impressive, about Wilson. The fancy word for his rhetorical practice is \u201csophistry.\u201d The unfancy word for it is \u201cbulls**t.\u201d He\u2019s what Tucker Max would have been had Max inexplicably decided that firearms and anarchism were more fun than various combinations of women and booze. When he complains that the attentions that his work has garnered have upset his parents, the only reasonable response is, \u201ctoo bad, bro.\u201d When some talking head lawyer evinces concern that if convicted of violating certain regulations, Wilson would end up in a less than pleasant prison, one says, \u201cGOOD.\u201d (As of this writing he walks the earth a free man, and a co-founder of a website called \u201cHatreon.\u201d) This movie is reasonably well directed by Adam Bhala Lough, but it\u2019s far too dependent on and indulgent of its subjects, who also include Amir Taaki, a mouthy British Bitcoin evangelical who teams up with Wilson on a project called \u201cDark Wallet\u201d (these guys and their projects are way too dependent on comic book imagery). There\u2019s a lot of talking head footage of Julian Assange, who, we ought not forget, is holed up in an embassy because of his disinclination to face rape charges. Every time his oily voice came over the soundtrack, I felt sick. The movie also falls back on a lot of boogity-boogity docu-clich\u00e9s. Skittery editing, ironic music cues, that sort of thing. While he pointedly intercuts Wilson\u2019s whining with accounts of mass shootings over the United States contemporaneous with Wilson\u2019s battle to keep the government\u2019s hands off his 3D printed gun, it\u2019s not enough. In the end, this is a scary movie about scary people that\u2019s too much in bed with these people, in the manner of a \u201cNazi Next Door\u201d newspaper feature article. Going back to Mao, the Chinese dictator once said, \u201cPolitical power begins at the barrel of a gun.\u201d I reckon Cory Wilson has heard this adage, but I wonder how well he really understands it.\u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
