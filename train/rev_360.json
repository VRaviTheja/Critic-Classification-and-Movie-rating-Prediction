{"Title": "Neruda", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The Chilean director Pablo Larrain gives the impression of aspiring to intellectual curiosity, political engagement, and committed anti-triviality. What a person aspires to and what he or she actually achieve are frequently extremely different things. I\u2019ve seen three of Larrain\u2019s features so far\u2014\u201cNo,\u201d \u201cThe Club,\u201d and this one, about the Chilean poet and political figure\u2014and the only thing I can say about him with near-absolute (subjective) certainty is that he\u2019s a persistently humorless filmmaker. Andrew Sarris had a category for guys like this: \u201cStrained Seriousness.\u201d Advertisement \u201cNeruda,\u201d directed by Larrain from a script by Guillermo Calder\u00f3n, begins in Chile just after World War II, and shows its title subject, a portly, bald-pated man who is not just a celebrated poet but also a Senator, enjoying all the perks of both positions. In the gigantic men\u2019s lavatory of\u00a0 the Senate building, he waxes pedantic to his colleagues. In his spacious house he hosts orgiastic costume parties; he dresses up as T.E. Lawrence at one. When asked to recite, he goes to a default verse, a famous one. As he performs grandiose and shallow postures, another presence makes itself known. In voiceover, an unseen enemy speaks of Neruda and his confreres: \u201cThey do not know what it is to sleep on the floor, but they are all red.\u201d The railing against the Limousine Left is coming from a police detective named \u00d3scar Peluchonneau, an anti-Communist whose sneers at Neruda and his kind will help fuel him once he\u2019s assigned to arrest the poet after a government shakeup that turns circumstances against Neruda and his fellow Communists.  The portrait of Neruda that continues is very different from the kindly poet depicted in the once-popular film fable \u201cIl Postino;\u201d this movie gives Neruda his teeth back, while at the same time lording it over him. Seemingly obliged to seek exile even as he aches to speak on behalf of his country\u2019s oppressed, he vacillates between bravery and peculiar cupidity. As he flees Peluchonneau\u2019s dogged pursuit, he baits the policeman, sending him genre novels and making his varied escapes in a deliberate nick-of-time fashion. Once Peluchonneau catches up with Neruda\u2019s wife, Delia, the woman has a surprise for him. Peluchonneau is not real, she tells him; he is a \u201csupporting character\u201d created by Neruda himself, to make the story of Neruda\u2019s escape from Chile that much more thrilling. This revelation throws the detective for a loop, to say the least.  And the movie itself takes Delia at her word, depicting Peluchonneau\u2019s mission in ever more melodramatic movie-movie fashion, depicting him goggled, riding in a motorcycle sidecar with bad mountainous-landscape rear-projection imagery behind him (shades of Guy Maddin). Larrain has cited the Argentinean fabulist Jorge Luis Borges as an influence, but this isn\u2019t really Borges\u2019 style of meta; and in any event a character becoming aware of his own fictional status goes back to Lewis Carroll if not farther.  The point of it all being that history and poetry are not possible without personified antimonies, real or imagined. \u201cNeruda\u201d does not make this point in any particularly convincing way, despite excellent performances by Luis Gnecco as the title character, a stolid Gael Garcia Bernal as his pursuer, and Mercedes Mor\u00e1n as Delia. \u201cNeruda\u201d is, like all the Larrain films I\u2019ve seen, laudable in its ambitions and ultimately unsatisfying in its execution.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
