{"Title": "The Bronze", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\u201cThe Bronze\u201d is to a motion picture as near-beer is to an alcoholic beverage: that is, it is not quite a motion picture. Whether or not you are a fan of its performers might be the determining factor as to whether you find it a \u201cnear movie\u201d or \"not even a movie\"; for this viewer, it was way more the latter, as witnessed by the fact that this ostensibly edgy comedy didn\u2019t wring a single laugh out of me until maybe fifteen minutes before the finale.\u00a0 This picture, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2015, is actually not unusual in its utter slackness. In fact, if my memory serves me well, this kind of half-baked concoction is now a Sundance staple, and the dirty little secret of the indie film. Here\u2019s how it works: a comedic talent concocts an abrasive character, a really abrasive character, a character that can get jaws dropping and butts squirming in seats at an improv sketch theater or some such place. Comedic talent then decides it might be a neat idea to construct an entire movie around this character. Only in the process, considerations such as credibility, scene construction, story pacing, and many more staples of conventional narrative cinema are left curbside (and when I call such concoctions half-baked, I remember that it is not an accident they invariably contain at least one prominent gag or set piece involving cannabis) in favor of More Outrageous Stuff for the abrasive character to do.\u00a0 Advertisement In \u201cThe Bronze,\u201d the abrasive character is Hope Annabelle Greggory, conceived and portrayed by Melissa Rauch, known for her sharp one-liners on VH1\u2019s \u201cBest Week Ever\u201d and now as a squeaky-and-sassy nerd girlfriend on \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d Hope is a former Olympic gymnast, celebrated in her Ohio small town for capturing the bronze medal back in the day. Now, her career prematurely ended by injury, she lives on dwindling endorsement earnings and by stealing money from the mail delivered by her postman father (Gary Cole). We first see the latter-day Hope lying in bed, masturbating as she watches the video of her prize-winning Olympic performance. As an orgasm-chaser, she snorts up a bunch of crushed-up painkiller pills. This sets the bar for the character\u2019s abrasiveness, so to speak; nevertheless, one is still unnerved at the frequency with which Hope curses out her dad, and the way she refers to a former high school classmate with a neurological disorder as \u201cTwitchy\u201d to his face.\u00a0 As it happens, co-writer Rauch and director Bryan Buckley know, or think they know, enough about movies to realize that they are obliged to create a redemptive story arc for Holly. So they do, to the extent that \u201cTwitchy,\u201d played by Thomas Middleditch of \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d actually becomes Holly\u2019s romantic interest as she softens up by training a young Olympic hopeful who could, Holly understands, steal her own small-town thunder. The movie\u2019s jokes take uncertain aim at the shallowness and corruption of televised athletics. While there\u2019s a certain potential irony in Upright Citizens Brigade-types getting snooty about jocks, as it were, this is not something considered in the movie\u2019s philosophy.\u00a0 The most talked-about scene in the movie comes near the end, in the form of a slapstick sex scene that\u2019s rather like the one in \u201cTeam America: World Police,\u201d with the novelty of it being enacted by actual people\u2014the actors portraying the characters or maybe their stunt doubles or some combination thereof, the lighting makes it hard to tell\u2014and it\u2019s not only not particularly funny, it\u2019s tonally so discordant from the already incoherent movie that it\u2019s \u2026 well, \u201cconfusing\u201d isn\u2019t the right word. \u201cUpsetting\u201d isn\u2019t, either, as one has kind of stopped caring by this point. Hard to say what the right word is. But it\u2019s not a good one.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
