{"Title": "Before I Wake", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Mike Flanagan has become an in-house horror factory for Netflix, and built quite a following in the process. Netflix Originals \u201cHush\u201d and \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d earned the talented filmmaker such cultural cachet that he parlayed their success into an original series for the service, \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House,\u201d currently in production. As if to further bolster what seems like it could become its own channel on the service before long, Netflix has unearthed the long-delayed third film by the director of \u201cOculus\u201d and \u201cOuija: Origin of Evil,\u201d \u201cBefore I Wake,\u201d which was originally scheduled to be released in 2015 and already premiered in most international markets. The film was delayed a few times after its 2014 production and then fell into release limbo after Relativity Media went out of business. When this happens, the eventual release is often a letdown. Put simply, films often gather dust when left on a shelf, and sometimes they\u2019ve been left there for reasons other than financial. But this is not the case with \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d\u2014well, not completely. It\u2019s a flawed film, but there are elements that really work, especially the lead performance and some of Flanagan\u2019s gifts with composition. \"Before\u00a0I Wake\"\u00a0is also particularly interesting to watch now as one can see it as a career stepping stone to the movies he's made since. Advertisement The release of \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d revealed that Flanagan had long been carrying around the Stephen King book on which that film was based as it was his dream project. Were \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d to be released when it should have been, it would have been easy to see even then that Flanagan was a fan of King\u2019s style. This unfolds a lot like a King short story with its focus on grief and lessons about being careful what you wish for. Clearly inspired by the author,\u00a0\u201cBefore I Wake\u201d is evidence of a young horror voice working through ideas that one would have called promising three years ago\u2014a promise Flanagan has\u00a0already fulfilled for most. He\u2019s a filmmaker interested in human emotions and reactions more than he is things that go bump in the night.    \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d opens with a scene reminiscent of the opening of Joachim Trier\u2019s \u201cThelma.\u201d A man (Dash Mihok)\u00a0nervously watches a boy sleeping. The man pulls a gun on the child, clearly terrified. What would make a man almost kill a young boy? He can\u2019t do it, and we cut to the boy being adopted by Mark and Jessie Hobson (Thomas Jane & Kate Bosworth), a couple who we learn has not long ago lost their own son in a tragic drowning. The boy is named Cody (Jacob Tremblay, who shot this before his breakthrough in \u201cRoom\u201d), and he\u2019s, well, special.    After Cody has gone to sleep one night, Mark and Jessie see brightly colored butterflies around their living room. Mark goes to capture one, only to have it disappear as Cody wakes. Yes, Cody can manifest his dreams. Rather than turn this into a pure boogeyman tale, Flanagan channels the grief of parents who have lost a child through his concept when Cody \u201cmanifests\u201d Mark and Jessie\u2019s dead son. What if someone could give you one more chance to see, touch, and even hear someone you\u2019ve lost? Of course, it comes with a hitch\u2014kids have nightmares too, and Cody\u2019s are of a monstrous creation he calls \u201cThe Canker Man.\u201d    Advertisement Flanagan cleverly weaves his emotional themes through his horror story, embodied in lines like \u201cSometimes scary things go away when we understand them a little,\u201d one that has heightened meaning when one considers the story when the origin of \u201cThe Canker Man\u201d has been revealed. It\u2019s things like this\u2014the way Flanagan refuses to merely tell a jump scare story\u2014that elevate his work. And he\u2019s phenomenal with actors, drawing a great performance from Carla Gugino in \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d and the underrated Kate Bosworth here, who\u2019s fantastic at conveying a hard-to-imagine blend of grief, anxiety, fear, and hope. Flanagan loves close-ups, and he directs his actors well within them. He\u2019s equally deft at the reveal shots we come to expect from horror such as a figure in a doorway in the background in the middle of the night. When \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d gets to the jump scare portions in the mid-section of the movie, especially in a misguided bully subplot, that's\u00a0when it falters, almost as if Flanagan is way less interested in boogeymen than he is the face of a grieving mother.    \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d culminates in a sequence almost out of \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d in its dreamscape visuals and one is reminded of Flanagan\u2019s skill with framing (and he uses a great score by\u00a0Danny Elfman effectively), but also that not everything is coming together here thematically or narratively. Like the butterflies that flit across the frame throughout the movie, the various pieces of \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d are individually beautiful but don\u2019t quite cohere into a complete vision in the end. While there's more to like here than in half the horror offerings on Netflix, \"Before I Wake\"\u00a0needed one more pass in the writing or editing process, or needed to be done later in Flanagan\u2019s career when he could more confidently stick the landing. Given his rise to fame in the few years this has been on the shelf, maybe Netflix will let their horror all-star remake it someday.", "Critic": "Beta"}
