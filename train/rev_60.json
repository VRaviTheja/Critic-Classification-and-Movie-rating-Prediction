{"Title": "The Ridiculous 6", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "I\u2019ll be honest. While I really do try not to form any\r\nopinion at all before watching a film, I approached Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d with some understandable trepidation. The stories of a script so racist\r\nthat several of the Native Americans involved in the project walked off the set didn\u2019t\r\nexactly fill me with hope, and Sandler\u2019s comedy track record has been spotty at\r\nbest, somehow getting even lazier as his career has devolved into getting studios\r\nto pay for his vacations (\u201cJust Go with It,\u201d \u201cBlended\u201d). When Netflix decided\r\nto not screen it for TV or film critics before it premiered on their streaming\r\nservice today, it felt like the final straw. Little did I know how bad it would\r\nbe. The combined \u2013isms of a script in which a Native American character is\r\nnamed \u201cBeaver Breath\u201d are overwhelmingly unfunny enough, but it\u2019s really only one aspect\r\nof the monumental failure on display in a film that is almost bafflingly bad.  Advertisement Where do we begin? The recurring joke about a burro with\r\ndiarrhea that can spray across the room? The extended bit in which a man scoops\r\nout his right eye? The character who is supposed to be so dumb that he thinks\r\nwomen poop babies and says \u201ccanty-lopes\u201d\r\nand \u201cpanty-cakes\u201d? The fact that\r\nVanilla Ice plays Mark Twain and actually says, \u201cMake it rain like Twain\u201d as he antes into a poker game? You read that\r\nright\u2014Vanilla Ice plays Mark Twain.\r\nHow about the multiple occasions in which you can see people like Blake Shelton\r\nand Will Forte look around and basically say, \u201cCan you believe we\u2019re getting paid for this?\u201d It\u2019s like someone\r\nmade a bet that they could take money from a major company like Netflix and do\r\nthe absolute bare minimum with it. The best place to start is probably with Adam Sandler\u2019s\r\nhalf-asleep, horrendous performance\u2014the worst of his career\u2014in the lead role of\r\nTommy, aka White Knife, a man raised by the Apaches to have superhuman fighting\r\nskills. Sandler can\u2019t decide if Tommy should be the stoic, leader of this gang\r\nof misfits or the wacky Native American stereotype he likely first conceived him as, and so he makes no choice at all outside of \"sleepy.\" He can\u2019t hide\r\nhis disdain or complete lack of interest in the project. I get that Sandler is\r\nmaking movies pretty much just to keep his friends employed at this point, but\r\nwould it be too much to ask to see an ounce of acting effort?  Tommy\u2019s journey begins when he meets his father, Frank\r\nStockburn (Nick Nolte), just before the old man is kidnapped by a bad guy named\r\nCicero (Danny Trejo). He leaves his tribe to find his dad, discovering along\r\nthe way that Frank was a busy man and Tommy has five half-brothers: Ramon (Rob\r\nSchneider), Lil Pete (Taylor Lautner), Herm (Jorge Garcia), Danny (Luke Wilson)\r\nand Chico (Terry Crews). They form \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d and set out to save their\r\nnewly-discovered patriarch. To say that Sandler and Tim Herlihy\u2019s script is \u201cepisodic\u201d\r\nwould be an understatement. It\u2019s a series of scenes only loosely connected by\r\ncast and location. I\u2019ve seen episodes of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in which the\r\nsketches seemed more of a single piece than parts of this film. One minute,\r\nthey\u2019re learning how to play baseball from John Turturro; another minute they\u2019re\r\nplaying poker with Vanilla Ice, David Spade and Blake Shelton. It\u2019s like\r\nsomeone put ideas for Western-themed sketch comedy on a board and then Sandler\r\nthrew darts at it to determine its order. The film has no flow, no rhythm, and\r\nabsolutely no reason to be 119 minutes. Advertisement And then there\u2019s the broad racism and misogyny of the piece.\r\nAfter the controversial walk-offs, Netflix claimed that this was \u201csatire.\u201d It\u2019s\r\nnot. There\u2019s nothing satirical about Sandler\u2019s bad Native American accent\r\n(which totally comes and goes, by the way) or Schneider\u2019s Hispanic caricature. Saying\r\nthat this is satire is like the drunk guy at the bar telling you how many black\r\nfriends he has after telling a racist joke. Don\u2019t fall for it. There are a pair of good-to-great Westerns coming out in the\r\nnext few weeks in theaters that should satisfy your need for gunslingers and\r\nhorse-riding. Much has been made of the impact that Netflix has had on the television\r\nlandscape. Given the fact that \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d is the first of a\r\nfour-picture deal with the company, they seem to have little interest in making\r\nthe same impact in the world of film.", "Critic": "Beta"}
