{"Title": "Sweet Country", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "It takes a while to fully register that this Australian Western is set in the late 1920s. There\u2019s a lot of space in the Northern Frontier in which it is set, and it\u2019s unsullied by telephone poles or power lines or railroad tracks. It\u2019s only late in the film, in a scene in which a particularly bothered character rides his horse in front of a projector that\u2019s screening a movie out of doors that a sense of the modern world comes across. At least in material terms. In terms of racial attitudes, most of the white characters in \u201cSweet Country\u201d are as contemporary, and/or as ancient and trite, as they come. The movie opens on a peaceful scene as Sam Neill\u2019s character, Fred Smith, sits on his porch. He\u2019s approached by Harry March, a young rancher just back from the Boer war. He wants Harry to give him some help with a fence; he offers him rum and tobacco as reward. \u201cWe don\u2019t drink here at Blackhill; we don\u2019t smoke either.\u201d March insists Smith lend him one of his farm hands, an indigenous Australian who goes by the name of Sam Kelly (Hamilton Morris). \u201cIt\u2019s the Christian thing to do,\u201d March simperingly says to Smith, who\u2019s revealed himself as a man of religious inclination.    Advertisement As he works with Sam Kelly, March evinces a morbid interest in the lifestyle of the indigenous man. \u201cYou marry \u2018em young around here, don\u2019t you?\u201d March says, referring to the younger woman in Harris\u2019 household. No, Harris says; that\u2019s his niece.    After closing all the shutters in a house on his ranch the better to rape Sam Harris\u2019 wife, March tells her: \u201cI wanted the other one, but you\u2019ll do.\u201d    You might say March has it coming, and he certainly does, but when he gets it, from Sam Harris, who is eventually driven to shoot March in self-defense, the sense of justice is short-lived. One understands that terrible things are likely to happen to Sam now. He goes on the run, another war veteran who\u2019s now the local law, a Sergeant Fletcher (Bryan Brown) is summoned, and a miniature posse, including Fred Smith, who\u2019s going along to make sure Sam is captured and brought back alive.    But these \u201cwhite fellas\u201d have not got a clue what they\u2019re in for as they trail Sam into his own country. The aborigines who haven\u2019t made peace, let alone maybe ever seen, white settlers, prove a swift and persistent danger, not just to Fletcher and company but to Sam and his wife. Then there are the elements, including a great salt desert (or so it appears to be) which is the setting for one of the movie\u2019s most hallucinatory scenes, a shudderingly gorgeous mixture of beauty and dread.    For all that, on return Fletcher tells the barmaid whom he wants to settle down with that he saw a lot of \u201csweet country\u201d on his quest. This is a movie of visuals first and foremost; it\u2019s no fluke that director Warwick Thornton shared cinematography duties with Dylan River. In addition to capturing stunning images, Thornton has a sleight-of-hand maestro\u2019s joy in shuffling and fanning them. Lightning-fast cuts to flashbacks and flash-forwards keep the viewer on his or her toes in a bracing fashion. The words of Steven McGregor and David Tranter\u2019s script stay out of the way, except when they don\u2019t, particularly at the movie\u2019s end, which yields an anguished line from one of the characters that\u2019s on the nose to the point of self-parody.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
