{"Title": "Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "For its first thirty minutes or so, \u201cPopstar: Never Stop\r\nNever Stopping\u201d feels like the great comedy you did not know you needed in your\r\nlife. That is to say, it feels like the \u201cThis is Spinal Tap\u201d for the Justin\r\nBieber generation. Credited as a \u201cLonely Island\u201d film, it is the work of the\r\nthree musically adept comic minds behind the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d digital shorts that were for a long time a mainstay and highlight of that comedy\r\nseries. The LI front man was, and remains, Andy Samberg, the trio member who\r\nwas also a full-time cast member of \u201cSNL.\u201d Their song pastiches combine raunchy\r\nhumor (you may recall \u201cD**k in a Box\u201d) with more-clever-than-normal wordplay\r\nfor stuff so raunchy-humor-based, with a lot of genuine absurdism all tied together by beats and melodies that are as\r\ncredible as those in, you know, genuine contemporary pop songs. Some of the\r\nsongs here are pretty jaw-dropping, and at first the frame\r\nconstructed around them seems pretty can\u2019t-miss.  Advertisement Samberg plays Conner4Real, a pop star who, as explained\r\nin fake-rock-doc-minus-Marty-DiBergi-style, started in a Beastie Boys-like trio\r\ncalled \u201cThe Style Boyz.\u201d Depicted doing their big hit \u201cKarate Boy,\u201d they are of\r\ncourse rather spectacularly inept, and their ineptitude is made rather funnier\r\nby real-life cameos from the likes of Questlove and Nas testifying to their\r\nvital influence\u2014\u201cAre you kidding me, that song changed my life,\u201d says Nas, with\r\nsufficient conviction to earn him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. But\r\nit\u2019s clear, at least to some unknown contingent, that Conner is the breakout\r\nstar of the group, and the Style Boyz\u2014the other two are played by the other\r\nLonely Island fellows, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone; they co-wrote the\r\nmovie with Samberg, and take the directorial credit with Samberg as producer\u2014disband. Owen (Taccone) becomes the DJ for Conner\u2019s solo act\u2014he has\r\nthe whole set on an iPod, which he also uses to listen to audiobooks on the\r\nroad\u2014while Schaffer\u2019s Lawrence becomes \u201ca farmer\u201d and carver of very awful wood\r\nsculptures. (Schaffer wears a beard so egregiously fake that I was convinced\r\nthat it was itself a sight gag he would peel off on-camera at some point.\r\nBut no.)  \u201cPopstar\u201d\u2019s story begins with Conner prepping the\r\nrelease of his followup album to his solo debut, which he titled \u201cThriller,\r\nAlso.\u201d Conner is quite the dimbulb, and Samberg plays him with the trademark\r\nsweet goofiness that\u2019s his most reliable performing mode. The movie cheerfully\r\nskewers pretty much every convention of pop music manufacturing. Of his new\r\nalbum \u201cConnQuest,\u201d Conner says \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be surprise releasing it next\r\nThursday.\u201d His big artistic breakthrough is described as his pioneering of an\r\n\u201call-catchphrase\u201d guest rap on another artist\u2019s song. And more, and more, with\r\nexpert comic bits executed not just by the supporting cast proper, which\r\nincludes Tim Meadows and Sarah Silverman, but also by a near-endless stream of\r\ncameo performers drawn from Samberg\u2019s circles in both music and comedy and the\r\nplace on the showbiz Venn Diagram where they meet. The movie also happens to\r\ncontain one of the sharpest, and most pointed, send-ups of TMZ I\u2019ve ever seen.\r\nAnd then there are the songs, one a \u201csincere\u201d plea for marital equality that\r\nquickly devolves into Conner\u2019s own perhaps-protesting-too-much declaration of\r\nhis own sexual preferences. The \u201clive\u201d version of a number referencing Osama\r\nbin Laden is also a treat.  But, the movie\u2019s storyline is, truth to tell, a little thin.\r\nIt\u2019s pretty much the same scenario as the aforementioned \u201cThis is Spinal Tap,\u201d with\r\ndifferent structural stresses. That is, the \u201cband\u201d in this movie breaks up\r\npretty early on, but the quixotic nature of Conner\u2019s, um, new direction is so\r\nplain that certain inevitable scenes feel more inevitable than actually earned,\r\nwhich was never a problem with \u201cThis is Spinal Tap.\u201d And there are peaks and valleys to\r\nthe movie that are too noticeable. The movie\u2019s a tidy 90 minutes or so, but\r\nit starts to sag at the hour-mark and doesn\u2019t get its oomph back for a while.\r\nAll that said, though, what\u2019s good about this movie is funny, and refreshing,\r\nenough to make the dry spots feel more tolerable in retrospect. I\u2019m already\r\nhoping for a lot of deleted scenes on the Blu-ray release.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
