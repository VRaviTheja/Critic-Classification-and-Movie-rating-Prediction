{"Title": "The Protector 2", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Why, Tony Jaa, why? If you\u2019re familiar with the work of Tony Jaa, and have followed his career trajectory, you may think you know the reason I\u2019m asking the above question. For those needing to get up to speed: Tony Jaa is a pretty incredible Thai martial arts dude. Not much of an actor, but certainly enough of an incredible Thai martial arts dude to conceive and perform in a series of staggering action sequences in latter-day martial arts classics such as \"Ong Bak: Muy Thai Warrior\" and its two sequels. He is also known for eschewing what the martial arts movie pros call \"wire work\" (no flying kicks for him) and reliance on CGI. A good old fashioned organic incredible martial arts dude, in other words.  Advertisement So Jaa fans may think I\u2019m asking why he\u2019s doing wire work and putting himself in the same frame with CGI effects in his new U.S. release \"The Protector 2,\" but that\u2019s not it. I\u2019m upset because he\u2019s doing such cheesy wire work, and because the CGI effects he\u2019s interacting with are so lame. I\u2019m upset because he\u2019s appearing in a movie that unnecessarily tricks up the admittedly no-big-thing but still amiable character dynamic of the 2005 \"The Protector\" (Thai country boy makes odd couple with cranky cop) by introducing a villain played by RZA, arguably a hip-hop genius but still The Worst Actor In The World (a title he clinched with 2012\u2019s \"The Man With The Iron Fists\"). I\u2019m upset because all of the bad acting and bad plotting actually ameliorate the impact of the action scenes. Think about how bad the acting and plotting have to be in order to distill the impact of a Tony Jaa battle scene. If you know a little about Tony Jaa, that\u2019s kind of hard to imagine. I know. But trust me. Or don\u2019t. The fact is this: if you\u2019re already a Tony Jaa fan, you\u2019re going to see \"The Protector 2\" anyway. And then you\u2019re likely to say, \"Boy, Glenn Kenny was right. Despite the spooky-chick martial arts nieces who go after Tony \u2018cause they think he\u2019s killed their gangster uncle, despite the concubine-to-RZA female warrior whose first appearance is in a costume that looks like Mila Jovovich\u2019s getup in \"The Fifth Element,\" despite the truly nifty car chase scene in the first third, despite the AWESOME power of Tony Jaa\u2019s kicks and punches and feints, this is really kind of lousy! I blame RZA.\" If you\u2019re not a Tony Jaa fan, you should start with \"Ong Bak,\" then see everything else. After which you\u2019ll say, \"I wonder if they were right about how lousy 'The Protector 2\u2019 is.\" And then you\u2019ll find out.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
