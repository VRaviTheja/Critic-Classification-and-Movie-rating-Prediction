{"Title": "Genius", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "About 25 years ago I met a fine artist, a painter, on a\r\ntrain trip to visit a mutual friend. We discussed our respective professions/enthusiasms,\r\nand she told me that as a rule she hated movies about painters because they\r\nwere almost uniformly false\u2014to the point of being corny\u2014in their depiction of\r\nthe act of painting. One exception, she said, was the then-recent \u201cLife Lessons,\u201d\r\nthe Martin-Scorsese-directed episode of the 1989 \u201cNew York Stories,\u201d in which\r\nNick Nolte played an abstract painter. That movie got it, she said. I was glad\r\nto hear it, as I enjoyed the movie too, but I also said that as someone who had\r\nlittle clue about how painting was actually accomplished, I could enjoy\r\nVincente Minnelli\u2019s \u201cLust For Life\u201d regardless.  Advertisement Writers have less of a hard time with movies about writers,\r\nbecause the act of writing is something that\u2019s somewhat pointless to depict\r\nvisually, so you kind of can\u2019t go wrong. But there\u2019s also a kind of inherent\r\nfutility in using a visual medium to convey the interior machinations of the\r\ncreative act. It\u2019s helpful, then, in concocting movies about writers, to choose\r\nor create writers who are oversized personalities, men and women who do a lot\r\nmore than spend time hunched over a desk wrestling with their own thoughts. The\r\nmovie \u201cGenius,\u201d directed by Michael Grandage from a script by John Logan, does\r\nnot lack for those. The central figure, though, is not a writer but an editor,\r\nthe real-life Maxwell Perkins, a man whose most pronounced eccentricity, it\r\nseems, involved almost never taking his hat off. \u201cGenius\u201d is the story of book\r\nman Perkins, friend and collaborator to the likes of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott\r\nFitzgerald, who play significant roles here, and the way Perkins took on and\r\ntamed the fiery poetic work of North-Carolina-born visionary (or blowhard,\r\ndepending on which literary critic you consult) Thomas Wolfe.  Perkins is\r\nplayed with reserve, hidden warmth, and scrupulous intelligence by Colin Firth,\r\nwhile Wolfe\u2019s role goes to Jude Law, who is more than well suited to declaim\r\nand thunder and be completely madly unreasonable in time-tested crazed-genius\r\nstyle. Perkins spends his days in the very woody offices of Scribner\u2019s,\r\nred-penciling such future masterpieces as \u201dA Farewell To Arms.\u201d In the evening\r\nhe takes the train home to a handsome secluded home where wait his wife and\r\nfive lovely, literate daughters. One day his office receives a ragged manuscript\r\nthat\u2019s more stack than sheaf. \u201cO Lost,\u201d it is titled, and the words that follow\r\nthat title, about the \u201clost wandering lonely souls,\u201d somehow grip the taciturn\r\nPerkins. When Wolfe drops in at Perkins\u2019 office, the writer is so cluelessly\r\neffusive that Perkins can barely get a word in edgewise, not even to tell him\r\nthat Scribner\u2019s is accepting the oft-rejected novel. The movie then spends a\r\nlittle while simulating how writer and editor honed down the stack to create\r\nwhat would come to be called \u201cLook Homeward, Angel.\u201d If you have\r\nany feel for writing, and I suppose if you particularly have any feel for\r\nWolfe\u2019s writing, you\u2019ll find the exchanges between editor and author\r\nexhilarating. Logan\u2019s script, based on A. Scott Berg\u2019s biography of Perkins, is\r\ninvested in the craft of words like few other movies nowadays, even those ostensibly about\r\nwriters. And if you have no particular concern for\r\nwriting, the emotional drama is not insignificant. Nicole Kidman plays Aline\r\nBernstein, a married woman who\u2019s Wolfe\u2019s lover and unofficial patron, and her\r\nscorn upon seeing her place in Wolfe\u2019s life become supplanted on account of\r\nPerkins\u2019 presence commands attention. As for Perkins, Wolfe starts looking like\r\nthe son he and wife Louise (Laura Linney) very clearly tried for but never had.\r\nAs success goes to Wolfe\u2019s head, though, Perkins gets inklings that he may have\r\ncreated an ego monster, while Wolfe himself insists that Perkins loosen up and\r\nfollow him to the places where he finds \u201cthe dark rhythms that inspire me.\u201d As\r\nfor Hemingway (Dominic West) and Fitzgerald (Guy Pearce), they make their concern and/or disapproval known\r\nfrom the sidelines.  Advertisement It could be\r\nthat I see so many dumb movies these days that I\u2019m inclined to cut a lot of\r\nslack for one of conspicuous intelligence, but I greatly enjoyed \u201cGenius.\u201d To\r\nthe extent that it\u2019s made me interested in checking out more Wolfe, who I\u2019ve\r\navoided like the plague since not enjoying his dialect short story \u201cOnly The\r\nDead Know Brooklyn.\u201d  I\u2019m not the\r\nonly one who was at least slightly taken aback, though, by a persistent quirk\r\nin the movie\u2019s casting, which is that not one of the Lions of American\r\nLiterature in this picture was played by, well, an American. Firth is British,\r\nLaw is British, Dominic West is British, Guy Pearce is Australian and so is Nicole Kidman. \u201cWhat about Zelda Fitzgerald,\r\nyou sexist?\u201d I can hear somebody saying. Well, yeah. She IS depicted in the\r\nmovie also. By Vanessa Kirby. A British actor. They all do\r\ntheir jobs pretty splendidly though so I can\u2019t really complain. But I did\r\nnotice. As well you might, too.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
