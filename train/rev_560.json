{"Title": "Hail, Caesar!", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "It\u2019s been some time since Joel and Ethan Coen have made a\r\nfull-out comedy. The producing, writing, and directing (and editing, too,\r\nalbeit under an assumed name) brother team\u2019s last three films, \u201cA Serious Man,\u201d\r\n\u201cTrue Grit,\u201d and \u201cInside Llewyn Davis,\u201d certainly haven\u2019t lacked for funny\r\nmoments. But \u201cMan\u201d was an apocalyptic riff painted on two inches of ivory,\r\n\u201cTrue Grit\u201d a rousing adventure that gradually mutated into a memory play about\r\nloss and mortality, and \u201cLlewyn Davis\u201d was at least in part a deeply sad story\r\nof inescapable existential failure. In other words, pretty heavy s**t. Their\r\nnew film, \u201cHail Caesar!\u201d is an exhilarating switchup: A comic fable that\u2019s both deftly clever and\r\nirrepressibly goofy. It is also, from stem to stern, the sweetest and sunniest\r\nfilm the Coens have ever made. Although you might not guess that from its\r\nopening shot, of a sculpture of a crucified Christ figure in a Catholic church.\r\nBear with me.  Advertisement Set in an unspecified period in 20th-century\r\nHollywood some time between the end of World War II and \u2026 well, certainly before\r\n1960, although the movie is meticulously determined in certain ways to be as\r\nahistorical as possible, \u201cHail Caesar!\u201d depicts 28 or so hours in the life of\r\none Eddie Mannix, played here with a beautiful combination of no-nonsense\r\ngruffness and tortured tenderness by Josh Brolin. The Coens took the name of\r\ntheir character from the real-life name of one of the more villainous figures\r\nin backstage Hollywood history (he was played by Bob Hoskins in the much darker\r\nTinseltown riff \u201cHollywoodland\u201d), but this entirely fictional Mannix is a\r\nharried ordinary-joe exec, \u201cHead Of Physical Production\u201d for a studio called\r\nCapitol Pictures. Capitol churns out conscientiously produced but hopelessly\r\nschlocky big pictures in a variety of genres, from Biblical epics to cornball\r\noaters.\u00a0 On this day in the life, Mannix has a number of big problems to contend\r\nwith. The front office wants Mannix to \u201cpromote\u201d singing cowboy Hobie Doyle\r\n(Alden Ehrenreich) from B-western star to romantic comedy leading man, much to\r\nthe confusion of the eager-to-please Hobie himself, and the consternation of\r\nhis new, exacting director, self-styled studio auteur Laurence Laurentz. The\r\naquatic musical star DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is newly pregnant,\r\nwhich is making her mermaid costume painful to wear, and on top of that, she\u2019s\r\nnot sure if she\u2019s interested in marrying the father of her child, a refusal that would constitute a potential PR gaffe for a studio that prides itself on an All-American image. A pair of twin gossip columnists (both played by\r\nTilda Swinton) are demanding answers to awkward questions and threatening to go\r\npublic with an awkward story about the studio\u2019s biggest matinee idol, Baird\r\nWhitlock (George Clooney). Finally, and most crucially, Whitlock himself has\r\nbeen kidnapped from the set of his Biblical epic, by a group of disgruntled Communist\r\nscreenwriters who call themselves \u201cThe Future\u201d in their terse ransom note. In\r\nthe meantime, Mannix must deal with his personal demons: he\u2019s a devout Catholic\r\nwho almost compulsively goes to confession, much to the exasperation of his\r\notherwise kindly and indulgent confessor. He frets over having told his loving\r\nwife that he\u2019s going to quit smoking, and then sneaking some cigarettes during\r\nhis stress-filled day. He\u2019s also being aggressively courted by a recruiter from\r\nLockheed, who tempts Eddie with a vested position, the promise of saner hours,\r\nand the chance to involve himself with something \u201cserious.\u201d How serious? This\r\ncharacter shows Eddie a shot of a recent H-bomb test at Bikini Atoll. \u201cLockheed\r\nwas there,\u201d he intones. You can tell this character is the devil because he\r\nalways offers Eddie a cigarette when they meet.  The Coens being the Coens, they cannot, or rather do not,\r\nresist the temptation to take what were and remain serious matters\r\nnot-terribly-seriously; in their funhouse mirror mashup of 1950s Hollywood, the\r\nostensible Red Scare was no \u201cscare\u201d at all but rather a Cold War component in\r\nwhich a big Hollywood star might conceivably defect to play \u201cSoviet Man\u201d for\r\nMosfilm. Once in the hands of his kidnappers, the amiable but boneheaded Whitlock\u2014poor\r\nGeorge Clooney, playing his fourth idiot for the Coen Brothers, is stuck in a\r\ngoofy Roman Centurion costume and haircut for the whole movie\u2014is instructed in\r\nMarxist logic by no less a personage than Dr. Herbert Marcuse himself. (Okay,\r\nhe\u2019s only referred to as \u201cProfessor Marcuse,\u201d but actor John Bluthal is made up\r\nto look like the actual figure.) All this cockeyed revisionist history may\r\ninspire scary thoughts of Steven Spielberg\u2019s (ostensibly) disastrous 1979 comedy \u201c1941.\u201d And to tell you the truth, there is more than a bit of broad,\r\nblithely unserious japery at play here. One also recalls \u201cThe Hudsucker Proxy\u201d\r\nand the Sam Raimi-directed, Coen-Brothers-co-written \u201cCrimewave.\u201d But the Coen\r\nBrothers have funnier jokes than Spielberg did, and they also know their real\r\nstuff at an almost dangerous level\u2014in the new commentary to \u201cInside Llewyn\r\nDavis\u201d on the Criterion Collection disc, writers Robert Christgau and Sean\r\nWilentz marvel at a throwaway Max Schactman reference in the movie that flew\r\nover the heads of 99 44/100th percent of viewers, and here they\r\npresent an American Communist Party membership card replete with a Gus Hall\r\nsignature.  Advertisement You can miss or ignore so many of these details and still\r\nenjoy the exquisite clockwork mechanism of the movie\u2019s plot, and/or the various\r\npastiches of old movies it offers up in differing manifestations. The goofily,\r\ncluelessly homoerotic \u201cNo Dames\u201d musical number, starring a game-as-always\r\nChanning Tatum, is a highlight, as is the near-pornographic whale-spouting imagery\r\nof the Busby-Berkeley-inflected Johansson-showcasing water ballet. (Around the\r\ntime of \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d I asked the Coens if they were influenced by the\r\nTechnicolor musical films of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, and they\r\nwere characteristically cagey in response; here they acknowledge their fandom\r\nby scoring the water dance to a bit from Offenbach\u2019s \u201cTales of Hoffmann.\u201d) The\r\nmovie\u2019s performances are all spectacularly rewarding, but Ehrenreich\r\npractically steals the picture as the completely ingenuous singing cowboy who\r\nain\u2019t quite as dumb as he seems, not by a long shot.  The movie makes light of the dialectic as explained to Baird\r\nby Marcuse, but it also, in its tricky way, continually invites/compels the\r\nviewer to use it. Eddie Mannix is a good man who is very good at his job\u2014but\r\nhis job seems to be manufacturing schlock. People enjoy schlock, but schlock is\r\narguably an agent of The People\u2019s oppression, so \u2026 anyway, one needn\u2019t go on.\r\nSuffice it to say that in the cosmology of the delightful \u201cHail Caesar!\u201d,\r\nregardless of the conclusions to which dialectical thinking may lead,\r\nacceptance is the key, and Hollywood,\r\nwhile \u201cproblematic,\u201d is more a force for good than the military-industrial\r\ncomplex can ever hope to be. And, finally, doing the right thing is an instinct\r\nshared by both company men and singing cowboys, for whatever that\u2019s worth.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
