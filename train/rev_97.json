{"Title": "Self/less", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Filmmakers have struggled with the definition of what it\r\nmeans to be a human being for decades. Are you merely a product of flesh and\r\nbone? Do you believe there\u2019s a soul? Or is your mind the most definitive aspect\r\nof your existence? From Rod Serling to \u201cSeconds\u201d to silly body switch movies\r\nlike \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the consideration of the human body as a shell, one that\r\ncan house a persona other than your own, has fascinated some of our most\r\ncreative voices. And when it was announced that a visually striking and\r\nphilosophically ambitious filmmaker like Tarsem Singh (\u201cThe Fall\u201d) was going to\r\nwade into these waters himself, there was reason for notable optimism. Which\r\nmakes the result, \u201cSelf/less,\u201d all the more frustrating. \"Self/less\" is a bland, generic\r\nproduct that almost defiantly refuses to explore the complex issues which it\r\nraises, perhaps in an effort to appeal to a wider audience. The narrative outline\r\nof \u201cSelf/less\u201d is a philosophical theme park, readymade for daring, complex\r\nfilmmaking. And Singh and his writers never go on any of the rides. Advertisement Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is an uber-wealthy New York\r\nbusinessman, the kind who appears to have chosen to cover his entire, lavish\r\napartment in gold one day, simply because he was bored. Sadly, all the wealth\r\nin the world cannot defeat the cancer that\u2019s killing him, nor can it reunite a\r\nbitter man with an estranged daughter (Michelle Dockery). Hale receives a\r\nmysterious business card that promises him a future that his body cannot. He\r\nmeets with an obviously nefarious scientist/CEO named Albright (Matthew Goode),\r\nwho tells Hale about \u201cshedding,\u201d a process that allows someone to discard their\r\nbroken body for a new, genetically grown one, for a cost of only $250 million.\r\nHale signs up. After going through a visually dull process (and here\u2019s\r\nwhere you start to wonder why Tarsem didn\u2019t make different aesthetic choices,\r\nand not for the last time), Hale wakes up in the body of Ryan Reynolds. He\u2019s\r\ngiven a new name\u2014Edward\u2014and relocated to New Orleans, where life appears to be\r\nexactly what he wanted. He drives a fast car, plays basketball, and even makes\r\na new friend (Derek Luke). The one hitch is that Edward has to take a little\r\nred pill at the same time every day or risk hallucinations, migraines and even\r\ndeath. After missing just one pill, Edward has a detailed hallucination that\r\nfeels more like a flashback, and discovers that this body was not grown in a\r\nlab. It belonged to a family man who sacrificed himself to pay for treatments\r\nto save his daughter\u2019s life. He finds Edward\u2019s family, including an\r\nexpectedly-startled wife played by Natalie Martinez, and learns the truth about\r\nhis new life, a truth that Albright and his suited cronies will do anything to\r\nkeep secret. Clearly, this is thematically dense stuff, from the way the 1% uses\r\nthe desperate needs of the poor to their own advantage to a reliance on\r\npharmaceuticals to stay happy and alive. Yet every time \u201cSelf/less\u201d feels\r\nlike it\u2019s going to actually explore one of those themes and give them more than\r\nlip service as plot details, it pulls back to standard, genre fare, both narratively and visually. \u201cSelf/less\u201d\r\nis one of those depressing affairs that gets less and less interesting as it\r\nprogresses. The opening scenes of opulence in Hale\u2019s penthouse have a strong\r\nvisual aesthetic\u2014empty rooms like empty minds waiting to be filled\u2014but that\r\ndisappears in the seemingly neverending second act, during which \u201cSelf/less\u201d\r\nsags and never recovers, feeling at times more like a failed cable TV pilot than a film. With its hallucinations, questions of identity, and philosophical\r\nresonance, it\u2019s simply inexplicable that \u201cSelf/less\u201d becomes as visually\r\nengaging as a \u201cCSI\u201d spin-off. Perhaps Tarsem was reined in by producers who\r\ndidn\u2019t want their \u201cRyan Reynolds Vehicle\u201d to become \u201cArtsy,\u201d but they made a\r\nfatal error. At 116 minutes, and with a narrative that telegraphs every twist a\r\nhalf-hour before it arrives, \u201cSelf/less\u201d needed a visual language that it just\r\ndoesn\u2019t have. Advertisement And that lack of personality isn\u2019t replaced by anything.\r\nReynolds isn\u2019t bad but he seems to have been directed to play Edward just a\r\ntick north of bland, which isn\u2019t exactly his strong suit. Someone here needed\r\nto realize that a movie this conceptually crazy needed to be fun. Movies like \u201cFace/Off\u201d\r\nare enjoyably ridiculous in large part due to the fact that Nicolas Cage, John\r\nTravolta and John Woo KNEW they were ridiculous, laughing and winking at the\r\naudience throughout. \u201cSelf/less\u201d is played on a straight line, never nearly as\r\nmuch fun as it could or should have been. Who knew immortality could be so\r\nboring?", "Critic": "Beta"}
