{"Title": "Unfreedom", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "The first feature by co-writer/director Raj Amit Kumar\r\nbegins by throwing the viewer into a seemingly random series of events, set in\r\nIndia and in the United States\u2014Delhi and New York City to be specific. Kumar\u2019s\r\na pretty busy (I presume he\u2019d prefer the term \u201cdynamic\u201d) cinematic storyteller.\r\nSo between the multiple characters, fast-shifting settings (an artist\u2019s studio\r\nwith a nude female painter stalking around it, the TKTS plaza at Times Square,\r\na backyard barbecue, a changing room for a woman prepping for a wedding, and so\r\non) and eye-opening action (why is the woman prepping for a wedding suddenly\r\nplaying with that gun, depicted in quick cuts showing her brandishing it in a\r\nvariety of ways, including, whoa!, putting it in her own mouth?), he builds up\r\nplenty of intrigue right away. At least one wants to figure out who these\r\ncharacters are, and how their stories are connected.  Advertisement Eventually who the characters are becomes clear, as does\r\ntheir lack of connection except by way of the concept so inelegantly put\r\nforward by the movie\u2019s title. The New York-based story finds a\r\nfundamentalist who\u2019s come in from Pakistan and is assigned by sleeper ops to\r\nkidnap a Muslim cleric who preaches an anti-extremist perspective. In India, a\r\nyoung woman forced into an arranged marriage pines for her lesbian lover, the\r\naforementioned nude artist, and takes radical action to be reunited with her, part\r\nof which includes turning the aforementioned gun on a male lover of the artist.\r\n These storylines are not just intercut with some showy\r\ncorrespondences (a New York highway becomes a Delhi road in the flick of an\r\nedit) but are interspersed with flashbacks, fantasy sequences, and more.\r\nDialogue is presented out of sync and used to push the visual action forward\r\nin time. Kumar has a very evident\r\ncommand of a lot of filmmaking techniques. He\u2019s clearly pretty passionate about\r\nthe stories he wants to tell. But as the film goes on, the stories become ever\r\nmore\u2026well, \u201cfar-fetched\u201d isn\u2019t a sufficient term to describe what they become.\r\nThe kidnapping plotline in particular takes twists and turns that are extremely\r\noverbaked, and once the extremist has got his battered victim back in a cozy\r\nbrownstone, and has got the cleric, his young wife, and their young son all\r\ntaped down to various household surface, the movie ventures into the realm of\r\npure grindhouse sadism. It\u2019s borderline reprehensible, in spite of Kumar\u2019s intentions.\r\nIlluminating the depradations of a self-styled jihadist is one thing; holding\r\nthe viewer by the back of the head and shoving his face into a welter of\r\nsimulated blood is another, and it\u2019s not a strategy that\u2019s likely to build a\r\nlot of viewer goodwill. Similarly, the sad end of the Delhi plotline is a\r\njailhouse scene in which a defied father gives tacit approval to something no\r\npatriarch should ever permit is not presented as explicitly, but still has an\r\nemphasis one can only describe as morbid. Do such outrages happen in real life?\r\nOf course they do, and they\u2019re awful, but their representation in this work is\r\nso willfully heavy handed that coherence of any kind\u2014artistic, dramatic,\r\nideological\u2014finds no bearing. As accomplished and committed as most of the cast\r\nis, one doesn\u2019t so much find affinity with the characters they play as feel bad\r\nthat they were compelled to enact such ugly movements.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
