{"Title": "Alex of Venice", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "An affectionate cinematic paean to a form of West Coast\r\nbohemia that could well be on its last legs, \u201cAlex of Venice,\u201d directed by\r\nyoung actor Chris Messina (best known for a recurring role on \u201cThe Mindy\r\nProject\u201d) and featuring an impeccable-as-usual lead performance from Mary\r\nElizabeth Winstead, is likely to appeal more to viewers who have some previously\r\nexisting allegiance to/affinity with its cast or its milieu than those who\r\ndon\u2019t.  Winstead plays the title character, an attorney who works\r\nfor an environmental activism group, and she\u2019s very good at her job and very\r\ndevoted to it. Her home arrangement is rather unusual: she lives in a great\r\nramshackle house with her partner George (Messina), their young son Dakota\r\n(Skylar Gaertner), and Alex\u2019s dad Roger (Don Johnson), a one-time TV star who\u2019s\r\nquick with an encroaching-old-age-defying inappropriate remark. The cooking,\r\nthe cleaning, the looking-after-the-kid, not to mention keeping track of\r\nincreasingly inattentive Roger\u2019s appointments, has finally gotten to be too\r\nmuch for George, and the failed house-husband bails. Alex is left to handle an\r\nimportant case involving a tadpole-destroying spa development supervised by\r\nslick but not uncaring entrepreneur (Derek Luke) and tend to her withdrawn son\r\nand manage her motley household all by her lonesome. Roger, who gets brought\r\ndown a peg at a theater audition by being asked to audition for the oldest role\r\nin \u201cThe Cherry Orchard\u201d rather than the younger one he started reading for,\r\ncalls the cavalry in the form of Alex\u2019s wild-child sister Lily (Katie Nehra,\r\nwho wrote the script with Jessica Goldberg and Justin Shilton). Lily\u2019s just as\r\nsalty-mouthed as dad but a bit more of a help, and she of course is the trigger\r\nwoman for the \u201cyou are going to have sex tonight\u201d scene that\u2019s become\r\nobligatory in low-budget character-driven American films in which an attractive\r\nfemale lead is dumped early on in the diegesis.  Advertisement If you think I\u2019m saying the movie is a tad predictable, I\r\nam. Additionally, I found it a little pat. Film people like to quote the late\r\ngreat director Jean Renoir, an adage about how the truly terrible thing in this\r\nworld is that everyone has their reasons; Renoir the man didn\u2019t actually say\r\nthat, a character he played and wrote in \u201cRules of the Game\u201d said it, but never\r\nmind; in any event, it always springs to mind when I see a movie such as this,\r\nwhich goes out of its way to be very scrupulous in not making villains out of\r\nany of its characters. \u201cAlex of Venice\u201d is a pleasant sit; it only rarely\r\ndisturbs one\u2019s precious bodily fluids with an irritating non-observation (Alex\r\nprotests at one point that she doesn\u2019t know how to grill a steak, and this is\r\nlater confirmed, albeit in a way that suggests she couldn\u2019t even try to\r\nextrapolate how raw meat interacts with fire), but it\u2019s so even-tempered that a\r\ncrankier viewer than myself might accuse it of slathering bland compassion on\r\nits characters like California sunshine pouring through a very\r\ntastefully-opened aperture. Or of over-indulging a variation of indie-pop\r\nhumanism/compassion that had long curdled into clich\u00e9.\u00a0 Messina\u2019s fondness for a\r\nbouncily mobile camera, happily taking in all the all-too-human interaction,\r\nincreases the feeling of forced likeability. But the film isn\u2019t completely\r\nclueless about how to use its assets. Winstead is entirely attractive and\r\nterrifically alert and alive throughout. The whole business with \u201cThe Cherry\r\nOrchard,\u201d which seems a trifle know-somethingish at first, pays off with a\r\nreally lovely climactic scene, which the ever-underrated Johnson brings home\r\nwith a grace that\u2019s both sly and warm-hearted. And the movie\u2019s quirky setting\r\npays off dividends where you least expect them. At such moments, the movie\u2019s\r\nhumanism finally seems unforced, and everything is the better for that.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
