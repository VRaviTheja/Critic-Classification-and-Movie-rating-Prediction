{"Title": "Hector and the Search for Happiness", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Peter Chelsom's \"Hector and the Search for Happiness\" (based on the book\r\n by Fran\u00e7ois Lelord, a psychiatrist in real-life, just like the \r\neponymous Hector) treats happiness as an easily-digestible \r\ncross-stitched homily, the kind hung as harmless decorations in people's\r\n living rooms. It's chain-mail wisdom, sprinkled with balloons and \r\nkitty-cat faces, forwarded by people with too much time on their hands. \r\nIt's \"Eat, Pray, Love\"-lite, and \"Eat, Pray, Love\" was already \"lite.\" \r\nOne of the things \"Eat, Pray, Love\" and \"Hector\" have in common is that \r\nthey feature economically privileged people with enough disposable \r\nincome that they can leave their jobs for an indeterminate period of \r\ntime and take multiple international flights on their quest to \r\nunderstand themselves. Advertisement \r\nHector (Simon Pegg) is a psychiatrist. His patients bore him, and he has\r\n a hard time empathizing with them anymore (if he ever did). He has a \r\ngirlfriend named Clara (Rosamund Pike), who works for a pharmaceutical \r\ncompany, and is congratulated by her boss at a company meeting for \r\n\"never having heard of the two following words-'maternity' and \r\n'leave.'\" Hector and Clara have a tidy high-end life, make each other \r\nlaugh, seem to complement one another, and yet still, Hector is lost. He\r\n packs a backpack and flies to China. Why China, we don't know. \r\nDuring Hector's worldwide search for happiness, he scribbles down \r\nrealizations in his journal, numbering them neatly and accompanying each\r\n one with drawings. The drawings sometimes become animated, showing \r\nHector's growing sense that the world is alive with beauty and mystery. \r\nHector's realizations, though, would be self-evident to any child who \r\nhas seen a Disney movie, not to mention the fact that these realizations\r\n have already been expressed, and far better, by some of the greatest \r\nwriters and thinkers in history. Hector may want to save the money spent\r\n on international airfare and just stay home and read Shakespeare's \r\nplays, or George Eliot's novels or Carl Dennis's poetry. Hector, as \r\nplayed by the very talented Simon Pegg, is a man so shallow he has never\r\n asked himself any personal questions involving any depth whatsoever. \r\nThat's quite a feat for a man pushing 40. \"Hector and the Search for \r\nHappiness\" is extremely forgiving of its lead character, treating his \r\nquest romantically. There are a couple of moments when other characters \r\npoint out Hector's faults (one fight scene with his ex-girlfriend, \r\nplayed by Toni Colette, puts it extremely plainly), but those moments \r\nend up calling into question the point of the entire film. While \r\nunderstanding that \"Hector and the Search for Happiness\" is meant to be a\r\n parable, and not realistic, it uses the most condescending \r\nfortune-cookie thinking possible, not to mention calling in entire \r\nforeign nations to act as props to highlight one man's quest for \r\nenlightenment. \r\nOn his flight to China, Hector meets Edward, a wealthy businessman \r\n(Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), who ends up showing Hector around Shanghai. There \r\nare montages of the two of them wandering the streets, eating \"weird\" \r\nfood and pointing at the sights; Hector agog at the \"exotic\" setting. At a \r\nnightclub, he meets a sexy woman named Ying Li (Ming Zhao). We get \r\nvoluptuous, lingering shots of her naked back in the shower, and then a \r\nview of her fully naked body curled up in bed, as a fully clothed Hector\r\n stares down at her with tenderness. Bedding sexy natives is one of the \r\nperks of international travel. She is the only person he meets in China,\r\n and she is an amalgamation of unimaginative stereotypes. She is sexy, \r\nand also sweet, and kind of a damsel in distress, too, and she's also \r\nreally just a good girl inside! It doesn't help that some of her moments\r\n are accompanied by the sound of a Chinese gong. Advertisement \r\nHector meets smiling Tibetan monks who have faced terrible persecution \r\nand torture, and yet still, they laugh, circling rapturously underneath \r\nfluttering colored prayer flags, all as Hector watches in amazement, \r\ninspired. That is why Tibet is there, apparently: to inspire the rest of\r\n us. \r\nAfrica is a continent, not a country, and yet \"Hector and the Search for\r\n Happiness\" treats the entire gigantic land-mass, made up of multiple \r\nand diverse countries, as one place: Africa(\u2122). The airplanes in Africa\r\n are filled with breastfeeding women wearing colorful robes, men smoking\r\n cigars, and chickens wandering the aisles. The plane nearly crashes and\r\n everyone laughs uproariously. Hector is inspired by their careless joie\r\n de vivre! He meets a woman on the plane who tells him the secret to \r\nhappiness is in her recipe for sweet potato stew and she invites him \r\nover for dinner. The entire village in the unnamed African country turns\r\n out to greet Hector joyously, whooping it up supportively as he drinks \r\nwine and dances with them. These people have nothing better to do with \r\ntheir lives than try to teach some dumb white guy that it's fun to have a\r\n dinner party and hang out with your friends. The African sequence is a \r\nparticular low-point. Africa is shown as dangerous, gunfire in the \r\nstreets, and the entire \"country\" is boiled down into a place containing\r\n elephants, antelopes, saintly white aid workers, women with baskets on \r\ntheir heads, happy villagers and scary rifle-carrying soldiers. \r\nAs beautifully filmed as the worldwide tour often is (the film was shot \r\nby Kolja Brandt), \"Hector and the Search for Happiness\" has an \r\nundeniable strain of poverty tourism, mixed with the insulting belief \r\nthat those who have nothing somehow hold the secret to life. \"Hector and the Search for Happiness\" ends up, \r\nunintentionally, being a treatise on the cluelessness of affluent \r\ndo-gooders, those who look at a smiling poverty-struck woman in a \r\nrefugee camp and see her as evidence that the world is good because she \r\nis still able to smile! Sure, money isn't \r\neverything, but it certainly isn't nothing either. \r\nHector couldn't trek around for months on end without it. \r\nThe supporting cast features such heavy-hitters as Jean Reno, as a \r\nColombian drug dealer Hector meets in Africa, and Christopher Plummer as\r\n a brilliant and eccentric (he wears a pink sweatshirt during lectures) \r\nneuro-scientist devoted to studying happiness. Toni Collette's character \r\nAgnes seems openly irritated with Hector's quest, and by that point in \r\nthe film, many audience members will feel the same way. Hector is a \r\ncipher, a nonentity, a man with no inner life, until \u2026 smiling Tibetan \r\nmonks show him their prayer flags and something clicks for him. Pegg, a \r\ndiverse and sensitive actor, is fine, but here he's in the service of \r\nextremely poor material. Advertisement \r\nGood intentions are all over \"Hector and the Search for Happiness.\" \r\nClear care has been put into the project. There is nothing wrong with \r\ntrying to put on film a parable about what it means to be human; stories\r\n about unhappy trapped characters who discover a way to cherish the life\r\n that they have. Films like \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \r\n\"Stranger Than Fiction,\" to name just a few, treat this same topic with\r\n sensitivity, creativity, and emotional honesty. \"Hector\" is an animated\r\n Power Point presentation in comparison.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
