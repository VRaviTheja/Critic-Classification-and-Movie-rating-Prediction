{"Title": "Dark Places", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Gillian Flynn\u2019s script for\r\nDavid Fincher\u2019s incredible adaptation of \u201cGone Girl\u201d was a master class in\r\ngenre, taking an admittedly ridiculous, twisting and turning narrative and making its plot holes forgivable\r\nthrough sheer force of entertainment value. It makes sense that another of\r\nFlynn\u2019s novels, the sinister \u201cDark Places,\u201d would get the cinematic treatment\r\nas well, although this failed exercise could be used comparatively with \u201cGone\r\nGirl\u201d as a What Not to Do cinematic lesson. Whereas Fincher and Flynn brought\r\nstyle and flair to the saga of Amazing Amy, writer/director Gilles\r\nPaquet-Brenner presents a drab, dull, uninspired affair, enlivened only\r\nslightly by the talented cast assembled. Failing to find a visual language\r\nfor the piece that reaches beyond a Lifetime TV Movie and adapting the material\r\nin such a way that makes her protagonist largely inactive in her own story,\r\nPaquet-Brenner only makes the already-underrated \u201cGone Girl\u201d look even more\r\naccomplished. Advertisement When she was only seven, Libby Day (Sterling Jerins)\r\nsuffered the unimaginable. Her entire family was murdered in a shotgun rampage\r\nlike something out of \u201cIn Cold Blood.\u201d In fact, the murders earned that kind of\r\ninternational attention, especially after Libby\u2019s brother Ben (Tye Sheridan)\r\nwas arrested and sentenced for them. Accused of dabbling in Satanism,\r\nBen was convicted on little evidence, and true crime nuts have been convinced\r\nfor years that there was more to the Day murders. Of course, there was, because,\r\nwell, there\u2019s no movie otherwise. Bitter and hardened by life, grown Libby (Charlize Theron)\r\nhasn\u2019t been in touch with her incarcerated brother (played by Corey Stoll older)\r\nsince the crimes. That\u2019s when she\u2019s contacted by Lyle Wirth (Nicholas Hoult), a\r\nmember of a true crime club that collects items and information from bloodbaths\r\naround the country. He convinces the broke Libby to tell her story to the club,\r\nand she needs the cash enough to do so. Of course, Lyle has ulterior motives,\r\nconvinced that Ben is innocent, and he eventually talks Libby into digging\r\ndeeper into what really happened that night.  Both narratives\u2014the current-day investigation and the days\r\nleading up to the murder years earlier\u2014are intercut in this murky, unrefined\r\nscreenplay that piles up narrative and twists without ever considering the\r\npiece\u2019s deadly lack of characters. Theron does her brooding best to make Libby\r\nthree-dimensional, but, and this could be partly the fault of the source\r\nmaterial, she is almost always merely a listener to someone presenting more\r\ndetails about her past or entirely absent in the extensive flashbacks. Consequently,\r\n\u201cDark Places\u201d is a film without a protagonist, akin to watching recreated footage\r\non \u201cDateline NBC,\u201d as each flashback or revelatory conversation fills in a few more\r\ndetails of the overheated story without giving us a reason to care about it in the\r\nfirst place. Poor Theron wanders through a narrative designed around reveals; so she\u2019s either remembering things she couldn\u2019t have possibly\r\nknown about or hearing about things she should have figured out a long time ago.\r\nAs he often has lately, Corey Stoll actually makes out the best in a few\r\ncrucial scenes as the older Ben, and Hoult certainly isn\u2019t bad even if his\r\ncharacter, like so many of them, feels like a plot device.  Advertisement All of this leads to a distinct lack of urgency in \u201cDark\r\nPlaces,\u201d which makes the dour, depressing subject matter that much harder to\r\nenjoy. It's a checklist of awful things that can happen to a Middle American family. The Day matriarch (Christina Hendricks) is afraid of losing the farm,\r\ntheir dad (a suspect in the murders) is missing, Satanism threatens to entice\r\nyoung Ben, the kid is accused of child abuse, drugs, teenage pregnancy\u2014the whole\r\nthing verges on poverty porn given the lack of genre escapism provided. We\r\nneeded a reason to wallow in the dark places of Libby Day\u2019s horrible life to\r\nmake the cinematic journey worthwhile. No one involved in the production of \u201cDark\r\nPlaces\u201d ever asked a crucial question: Why should we care?", "Critic": "Beta"}
