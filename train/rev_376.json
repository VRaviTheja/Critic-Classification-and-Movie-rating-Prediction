{"Title": "Censored Voices", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The first fifteen minutes or so of this documentary were not entirely fruitful ones for this reviewer. There\u2019s a darkened, artfully photographed room, with a now-old fashioned reel-to-reel tape recorder sitting on a table, and an interview subject, the Israeli writer Amos Oz, listening to words he recorded almost a half-century ago. The premise is not, to say the least, unpromising. Oz is a veteran of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, which, as a text at the film\u2019s very beginning asserts, represented \u201cthe birth of modern Israel.\u201d Shortly after his service in that war, Oz and a few other colleagues conducted kibbutz interviews with themselves and other veterans, interviews that, a related text informs, have never been made entirely public until now\u2014hence the movie\u2019s title. Avraham Shapira\u2019s book \u201cThe Seventh Day,\u201d published in Israel in 1967, was based on the material, and is credited as a primary source here; Shapira is also among the film\u2019s interviewees. Director Mor Loushy\u2019s strategy of interposing shots of the spinning reels of the tape recorder, the darkened faces of the interviewees as they listen to their younger selves, and archival footage (which, the movie carefully points out, is not of the interviewees) at first made me think the material might have been better off in book form; the approach felt simultaneously rote and a little arty.\u00a0 Advertisement \n But Loushy is resourceful, particularly as an editor, and the talking heads, even those not as internationally famous as the compassionate, articulate, and still-distressed Oz, are spectacularly compelling. A few popular victory songs from the era play over triumphant-looking footage of Israeli soldiers interacting with citizens, and one former serviceman remarks \u201cWe see ourselves as Macabees.\u201d But there\u2019s hollowness and a bitterness here, not just with almost fifty years\u2019 hindsight, but in the immediate reflections of the soldiers interviewed just weeks after the victories. It\u2019s no accident that the best-friend character in Ari Folman\u2019s \u201cWaltz With Bashir\u201d was the filmmaker\u2019s therapist, or that the therapy-themed TV series \u201cIn Treatment\u201d was based on an Israeli show. The Israelis are in the main an implacably self-examining people, and the army men interviewed here are for the most part secular Jews. One interviewee recalls the mother of a dead friend saying \u201c[Jerusalem\u2019s] Western Wall isn\u2019t worth [my son\u2019s] fingernail.\u201d Provisionally Zionists, they are tortured by the fact that their national self-determination\u2014their right to a homeland, such as it is\u2014is tied into religious conflicts, beliefs they themselves do not even hold. What, they wonder almost as soon at they\u2019re demobilized, are/were they fighting for? \u201cWe\u2019re not murderers, but in the war, we all became murderers,\u201d says one man, ruefully. \n Loushy\u2019s choice of archival footage reflects a Western media that chose to function as a pep squad for the Israeli project. Clipped British voices declaim that \u201cone can only admire the efficiency\u201d of the Israeli army led by charismatic, eyepatch-sporting Moshe Dayan, and quip, over a shot of an abandoned pair of loafers on a street, that an Israeli squadron \u201cleave[s] the Egyptians shoeless in Gaza.\u201d But late in the film, Loushy shows ABC News\u2019 Bob Young reporting from an Arab refugee camp in Amman, saying that there\u2019s nothing growing there except \u201cseeds of revenge,\u201d and it\u2019s chilling.\u00a0 \n If Israel is a country at all (and in my view, for what it\u2019s worth, it absolutely is) it is one that consistently has to come to terms with the paradoxes and contradictions that it's practically made of, something this trim and disquieting film brings home with what turns out to be great economy and force. \u201cA society that won\u2019t tell itself the truth [\u2026] is in big trouble,\u201d says one of the interviewees. The words have perhaps never been more true. And not just for Israel, as the movie implies.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
