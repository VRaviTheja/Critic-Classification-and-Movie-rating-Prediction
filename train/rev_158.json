{"Title": "Mojave", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Mojave\" opens with Garrett Hedlund, with only slightly\r\nscruffier hair and beard than Ted Neeley had in \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d\r\ncomplaining to a video camera about the ennui of having been world famous since\r\nthe age of 19, and then elaborating on that discontent: \u201cYou wanna be like\r\nByron, you wanna go to Greece, you wanna run guns in Africa,\" that last bit alluding\r\nto Rimbaud\u2019s post-\u201cA Season In Hell\u201d career. Hedlund\u2019s character, Thomas, is\r\nthen seen ditching his French girlfriend, ducking calls from business\r\nassociates and family members, and driving a Jeep into the movie\u2019s title\r\ndesert, not before buying two gallons of water and two fifths of what I took to\r\nbe grain alcohol and being insufferably 80s-rock-star-rude to the old guy who\r\nsells the stuff to him. Once in the desert he tries to do away with himself,\r\ndrinking and yelling \u201cCome on!\u201d to the howling coyotes. The coyotes don\u2019t come.\r\nWhat does come is another person, a stringy-haired, gold-toothed drifter with a\r\nshotgun who sits by Thomas\u2019 fire and rambles on about \u201cmotiveless malignancy\u201d\r\nand complains that Ahab\u2019s wooden leg in \u201cMoby Dick\u201d is an \u201cexecutive decision,\u201d\r\nthat is, too obvious. This fellow, Jack, played by Oscar Isaac, grins, but as Hedlund\u2019s Thomas, he glowers. What the\r\nhell is going on here? Advertisement What can I tell you? When a literary author whose career in\r\nbook-writin\u2019 has been kinda-sorta hijacked by Hollywood, weird feelings tend to fester under the affluent lifestyle.\r\nFor this film, the second to be both written and directed by William Monahan,\r\nturns out to not be the Academy-Award-winning screenwriter\u2019s homage to Gus Van\r\nSant\u2019s \u201cGerry,\u201d but a revenge thriller set largely in the fleshpits of\r\nTinseltown. What happens is, surly Thomas gets a\r\nbit of a jump on Jack, but in the process kills another man, an\r\ninnocent\u2014although in the world Monahan envisions, no one is truly innocent,\r\nexcept maybe the six-year-old kid who rather predictably melts into a father\u2019s\r\nembrace in the movie\u2019s coda.\u00a0 Discovering that there\u2019s a serial killer roaming\r\nthe very desert he\u2019s leaving (he called a limo from a motel), Thomas, remaining\r\nsurly, goes back to Hollywood, secretes a revolver in the platform of his TV\r\ndisplay (on which he watches the Death Valley climax of Erich von Stroheim\u2019s \u201cGreed,\u201d\r\na totally typical touch), and consults with sleazy lawyer Walton Googins and\r\nargues with sleazier studio head Mark Wahlberg, and has desultory sex with\r\naloof and not-his-wife French Person Louise Bourgoin. But this is not enough\r\nHell on Earth for Thomas. Jack finds an address on the abandoned Jeep\u2019s\r\nregistration, says \u201cGame on,\u201d and hitchhikes to L.A., to engage in some\r\noccasionally \u201cStrangers On A Train\u201d style cat-and-mouse with Thomas. Monahan\u2019s conception of Thomas as an unlikable but\r\nnevertheless idealized imperial artist\u2014the film director as Calvin Klein model,\r\nKurt Cobain and Jim Morrison combined, only as well read as Harold Bloom\u2014is\r\nonly slightly less ridiculous than his conception of Jack as Thomas\u2019 secret\r\nsharer, an artist-manqu\u00e9-turned-killer of similar erudition. (At one point Jack\r\nbrags of having a \u201cJohn Stuart Mill\u201d-level IQ.) There is something kind of funny about these two bro-styled men arguing\r\nabout the accuracy of a George Bernard Shaw quote while kicking the crap out of\r\neach other, but I\u2019m not sure how much Monahan knows that, smart as he is. Like\r\nClifford Odets in his stage play \u201cThe Big Knife,\u201d Monahan sees show-biz decadence as\r\npractically apocalyptic. \"Who\u2019s the author surrogate?\" you may wonder. And this\r\nis part of the point. When Jack says, to a dog, \u201cThe Internet is a pain in the\r\nass. One can\u2019t give it too much of a place in one\u2019s life. It is a tool,\u201d well,\r\nthere\u2019s a clue right there. But eventually you figure he\u2019s got to fess up and\r\ngive his loyalty to the guy who\u2019s actually got some IMDB credits. Or does he?\r\n\u201cDo you know yet which one of us is the Bad Guy?\u201d one of the characters asks at\r\na tense moment; Monahan clearly wants to get maximum mileage out of that\r\nquestion.  Advertisement To his credit, the writer-director maintains a pretty decent\r\nbalance between his disgust with this Business We Call Show and the movie\u2019s\r\nthriller mechanics, which are not entirely well-engineered but do chug along to\r\na not-unsatisfying climax. Of the two leads, it\u2019s the impossibly sly and\r\ncharismatic Isaac, as you may have guessed, who has the upper hand, and he\r\nclearly relishes reeling off Monahan\u2019s loquacious dialogue, which makes a point\r\nof flirting with the most eyeroll-inducing pretensions. Wahlberg is pretty\r\nfunny playing a thoroughly repellent wannabe mogul (movie inside-baseball nuts\r\nwill be diverted by some obvious clues as to which real-life figure the\r\ncharacter might be based on) while Bourgoin is boldly non-ingratiating as the\r\nShallow Girlfriend In Peril.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
