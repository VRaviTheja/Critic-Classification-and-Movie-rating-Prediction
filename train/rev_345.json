{"Title": "A Quiet Place", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "John Krasinski\u2019s \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is a nerve-shredder. It\u2019s a movie designed to make you an active participant in a game of tension, not just a passive observer in an unfolding horror. Most of the great horror movies are so because we become actively invested in the fate of the characters and involved in the cinematic exercise playing out before us. It is a tight thrill ride\u2014the kind of movie that quickens the heart rate and plays with the expectations of the audience, while never treating them like idiots. In other words, it\u2019s a really good horror movie. Advertisement With his script, co-written by Bryan Woods and Scott Beck, Krasinski wastes no time. We see a family\u2014Krasinski plays the unnamed father, his real-life wife Emily Blunt plays the mother, and Noah Jupe (\u201cSuburbicon\u201d), Millicent Simmonds (\u201cWonderstruck\u201d), and Cade Woodward play their three children. The eldest, the girl, is deaf (as is the remarkable young actress who plays her). A title card says it\u2019s \u201cDay 89,\u201d and we can tell we\u2019re in a recently-post-apocalyptic world. The family very slowly\u2014on tiptoes\u2014moves around a small-town store, taking some of the few remaining supplies and some prescription drugs for the older boy, who looks like he has the flu. They communicate in sign language and are incredibly careful not to make a sound, but the youngest boy draws a picture of a rocket on the floor\u2014the thing that he signs will take them all away.    We quickly discern that sound in this world is dangerous. And the danger is intensified in the following sequence as the youngest child finds a toy that makes noise and ...\u00a0things don\u2019t end well. The bulk of \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d takes place over a year later, as the family continues to grieve and the mother is about 38 weeks pregnant. Preparing for the arrival of a newborn baby in a world without noise is difficult, and the father continues to pore over newspaper articles and research, looking for a way to stop the creatures that kill at the slightest sound.    Larger-than-life enemies that can detect their prey aurally have been a part of great cinema for years, from the xenomorph hunting the crew of the Nostromo in \u201cAlien\u201d to the dinosaurs of \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d and Krasinski knows that lineage. He\u2019s incredibly smart about the way he brings the viewer into this auditory game. He\u2019s regularly\u2014but not too regularly\u2014setting up what could be called 'auditory expectations.' He\u2019ll show us a shotgun or an exposed nail in the floor or a timer in silence\u2014and we know full well what sounds those are likely to produce. Don\u2019t worry\u2014Krasinski doesn\u2019t overplay it at all. There aren\u2019t rooms of wind chimes or broken glass. It\u2019s a very subtle, clever storytelling tool to build tension when a\u00a0director and his co-screenwriters aren\u2019t allowed to use dialogue to do so, and it pulls us into this world in a way that's unexpected and incredibly enjoyable. Advertisement It also helps that Krasinski displays a sense of composition and economic storytelling that he hasn\u2019t really before in other films. \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is a no-nonsense, lean movie\u2014the best kind when it comes to thrillers. It feels like every shot has been considered incredibly carefully as the film ticks like a clock on a bomb, perfectly balancing scares with scenes that set up the emotional stakes and the world of these characters. The film has a beautiful sense of geography, almost all of it taking place on a farm that Krasinski and his technical team lay out in a way that allows us to feel like we know it. This is not one of those films that mistakes shaky camerawork for horror storytelling. It\u2019s got a refined visual language that plays beautifully with perspective and the terrifying nature of a world in which we can\u2019t yell to warn/find people or, in the case of the deaf daughter, hear what\u2019s coming.    On that note, there\u2019s also\u2014without spoiling anything\u2014a strong, enabling message at the core of \u201cA Quiet Place.\u201d It\u2019s a film that\u2019s about empowerment more than sheltering, and it\u2019s that emotional hook that really elevates the final act. It helps a great deal that Krasinski completely sticks the landing. It has one of the best final shots in horror in years\u2014and, of course, it comes with a familiar auditory cue that had the audience here at SXSW cheering.    With almost no dialogue, \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d relies a great deal on visual storytelling, but I'll admit that it\u00a0also uses the crutches of composer Marco Beltrami's\u00a0strings for jump scares a bit too much. It\u2019s total conjecture, but one can almost sense Platinum Dunes head Michael Bay insisting on those devices, and I\u2019d love to see a version of \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d that\u2019s even sparser in terms of on-the-nose choices like sound-scares and an overheated\u00a0score.\u00a0 We live in a such a noisy world that it\u2019s hard to imagine that constant sound being taken away. We use noise to express ourselves\u2014it\u2019s a part of who we are as people. And \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d weaponizes that part of the human condition in a way that owes a debt to films like \u201cAlien\u201d but also charts its own new ground. So many great horror films are about people who have to adapt to survive\u2014they have to challenge their own insecurities or preconceptions to make it through the night. In that sense, great horror films are often about empowerment, taking away that which some might perceive as weak. \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d shreds the nerves, but it does so in a way that feels rewarding. You don\u2019t just walk out having experienced a thrill ride, you walk out on a high, the kind of high that only comes from the best horror movies.
