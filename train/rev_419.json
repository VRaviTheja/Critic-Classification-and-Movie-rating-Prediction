{"Title": "What We Did on Our Holiday", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "This movie opens with a clearly on-less-than-great-terms\r\ncouple of parents trying to corral their kids into a car. Dad Doug (David\r\nTennant) is negotiating with his youngest girl, the adorable and strange Jess\r\n(Harriet Turnbull) about the \u201cfriends\u201d she can bring with her; one of them, it\r\nseems, is a brick. \u201cHer best friends are stones now?\u201d Doug indignantly asks\r\nestranged wife Abi (Rosamund Pike) shortly after. \u201cHave you spoken to anybody\r\nabout it?\u201d The ever-exasperated Abi rolls her eyes and shoots back \u201cWho? A\r\ngeologist?\u201d Advertisement Good one, and \u201cWhat We Did On Our Holiday,\u201d written and\r\ndirected by Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin, is replete with zingers, a quality\r\nnot to be disdained in a family comedy of miscommunication. Doug and Abi are on\r\nthe outs, planning to divorce, but reuniting for a weekend to visit Doug\u2019s kin\r\nin the Hebrides. Doug\u2019s dad Gordie (Billy Connolly) is an ex football star\r\nwhose latest birthday will probably be his last. As Gordie eventually explains\r\nto Abi and Doug\u2019s oldest child, the curious and analytical tween Lottie (Emilia\r\nJones): \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of cancer? Well I\u2019ve got that.\u201d Doug and Abi are\r\ndetermined to keep up appearances not just for Gordie but the children\u2019s sake.\r\nBut of course the three children (the middle one is a cheekily ingenuous boy,\r\nMickey, played by Bobby Smallridge) see right through their ever-feuding\r\nparents\u2019 lies. Doug and Ari\u2019s feckless, near-constant deceptions are countered\r\nby Gordie\u2019s honesty. The exceptionally warm Connolly does great things with his\r\nrole as a long-haired patriarch determined to go out of his life his way,\r\ndespite the efforts of his other son, rich financier and utter twit Gavin\r\n(Billy Miller), to stage a white elephant of a party for him.  Once Abi and Doug finally get their brood to Scotland,\r\nGordie absconds to a beach with the three kids, where he sets an example of\r\nhonesty that they eventually take to a bit of an extreme. \u201cEvery human being on\r\nthis planet is ridiculous in its own way,\u201d Gordie reflects to Lottie, going on\r\nto say that the point of life is to love them not just in spite but because of\r\nthat. The movie is inspired by the BBC sitcom \u201cOutnumbered,\u201d also a Hamilton\r\nand Jenkin effort, in which two parents were pitted against three children and\r\na lot of the dialogue was improvised in a \u201ckids say the darnedest things\u201d\r\nspirit. \u201cHoliday\u201d does a good job of making the young characters look terrifically\r\nspontaneous, and the adult cast is rife with expertise: Pike is both frazzled\r\nand dry, while Tennant proves that his wide-eyed intensity works as well as a\r\ncomic tic as it does when he\u2019s playing an existentially tortured bloke in more\r\nserious fare. The movie\u2019s storyline takes an eccentric turn when the kids\r\ndecide to honor Gordie\u2019s wish for a \u201cViking funeral.\u201d While Hamilton and Jenkin\r\nprovide a lot of gentle moments of poignancy, and the cinematography of the\r\nScottish countryside (shot by Martin Hawkins) goes a long way in selling the\r\nmovie\u2019s the-simple-pleasures-of-life-are-best philosophy, \u201cHoliday\u201d wisely\r\nsticks to its frantic-but-not-grotesque-farce guns throughout its tidy 95\r\nminutes. It wears not just its Britishness but its relative good taste on its\r\nsleeve: unlike its U.S. counterparts, there\u2019s nary a poop or fart joke in\r\nevidence in this domestic comedy. It\u2019s not what you\u2019d call \u201cmajor\u201d cinema, but\r\nit\u2019s a breezy entertainment, particularly if you\u2019re a fan of one or more of the\r\ncast members.
