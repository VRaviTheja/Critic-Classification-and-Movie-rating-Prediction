{"Title": "Midnight Special", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "How far would you go to protect your child? What if saving\r\nhim meant letting him go? Jeff Nichols\u2019 brilliant \u201cMidnight Special\u201d weaves\r\nrelatable themes of parental responsibility and faith in that which is traditionally unexplainable into a sci-fi road movie, with echoes of John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, and Stephen King bouncing throughout. So many modern blockbusters err on the side of hand-holding,\r\nunderlining their plots and character motivations with consistent expository\r\ndialogue or overly defined narration. There\u2019s this bizarre concern by Hollywood\r\nthat audiences will rebel if they don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s going on at every\r\ngiven moment, and so characters talk to themselves, motivations are spelled out\r\nin voiceover, and everyone, especially in action movies, speaks of what they\r\nhave to do and why they have to do it. \u201cMidnight Special\u201d respects your intelligence, letting you come to its themes emotionally instead of narratively. It is a breathtaking\r\ndisplay of visual storytelling, confidently rendered by someone who understands\r\nthe power of cinema. Advertisement Nichols, who also wrote the film, plunges us into the action\r\nof the piece immediately. Two men\u2014Roy (Michael Shannon, who has appeared in\r\nevery Nichols film) and Lucas (Joel Edgerton)\u2014are in a motel room, watching a\r\nnews story about a manhunt involving a kidnapped boy. The boy is in between the\r\ntwo beds in the room, reading comic books with a flashlight. His name is Alton\r\n(Jaeden Lieberher), and he\u2019s special. He\u2019s so special that an entire religious\r\nsect has sprouted up around him, led by Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard). As Roy and\r\nLucas flee into the night with Alton in the backseat and wearing night vision goggles\r\nso they can turn off their headlights to make themselves harder to spot, Calvin\u2019s\r\ncompound is raided. It turns out everyone is looking for Alton. The FBI brings in a specialist to meet with Calvin\u2019s flock\r\nnamed Paul Sevier (Adam Driver), trying to figure what they know about the boy\r\nand exactly what this golden child means to them. It turns out that the cult of Alton\r\nworships numeric sequences that the potential prophet has been revealing to them. It also\r\nturns out that these numeric sequences mean something to the government, and\r\nthey want to know how a child knew them. Finally, the numbers seem to be pointing\r\nAlton, Roy and Lucas to a specific location. Lucas is one of the recently converted\u2014through a special power that Alton has to convey something transcendent through beams that shoot from his eye\u2014but Roy's devotion is purely parental. Both men need\u00a0to get Alton\u00a0there in\r\ntime; nothing will stop them. The drive of Roy, Alton\u2019s father, is made clear in an early\r\nscene in which the trio encounters a state trooper. He sees their license plate\r\nand looks like he\u2019s about to call it in when Roy and Lucas draw on him. Is\r\ntheir mission important enough to kill a cop? Roy\u2019s drive to do what he\r\nthinks he needs to be done for his son is motivated by the passion of fatherhood,\r\nbut is Lucas\u2019 purpose as committed? And how will Alton\u2019s mother, played by Kirsten\r\nDunst, respond? \u201cMidnight Special\u201d is masterful in the way it keeps answering\r\nquestions and then asking new ones, always staying one step ahead of the\r\nviewer. It\u2019s a testament to Nichols\u2019 direction that we trust that we are in the\r\nhands of a master, willing to take the journey wherever it may lead us.  Advertisement And the final destination for that journey, while I would\r\nnever spoil it, is surprisingly emotionally resonant. Alton being \u201cspecial\u201d could easily be read as an allegory for a sick child, one who is not like\r\nthe others and needs a different kind of care and attention; one who is special\r\nin a way that only parents who have dealt with that kind of pain and loss could\r\nunderstand. There is also an undeniable story of faith buried in \u201cMidnight\r\nSpecial\u201d\u2014about believing in something unseen, something greater than ourselves.\r\nMuch of this emotional undercurrent falls on the shoulders of Nichols\u2019 cast,\r\nespecially the driven, subtle performance from Michael Shannon, although he\u2019s\r\nmatched by great work from Dunst, Edgerton, Driver, and the rest of the cast.  \u201cMidnight Special\u201d also relies on essential contributions from cinematographer Adam Stone (who has worked with Nichols on all of his films) and composer David Wingo. Stone captures the natural world almost as another character (as he did in \u201cTake Shelter\u201d and \u201cMud\u201d) and makes a work of art out of a sequence that hinges on a sunrise. Nichols and Stone's compositions are completed by Wingo\u2019s score, which often drives us to the film\u2019s emotions as it goes daringly dialogue-free for large chunks of the action. In the end, that\u2019s what I take away from \u201cMidnight Special\u201d\u2014the\r\npower of visual storytelling. It is images from the film that pass through my\r\nmind most\u2014flames falling from the sky, a father carrying his child, the shaking of\r\ngrass as something is about to happen, and the jaw-dropping finale. Nichols is\r\nthe rare filmmaker who understands that this is what we take away from the best\r\nfilms, and the powerful way that art reflects that which transcends words: a father's dedication, the pain of a sick child, belief in something greater than ourselves. Sure, we quote our favorite lines and do impressions of characters, but\r\nit is the pictures that haunt us, that linger in our mind, and that stay with\r\nus. Sometimes forever.
