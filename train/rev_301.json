{"Title": "It's Not Yet Dark", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing romantic about death,\u201d Colin Farrell says during the opening montage of this movie. \u201cI love being alive.\u201d These are not Farrell\u2019s own words. The Irish actor is speaking for Simon Fitzmaurice, an Irish writer and filmmaker, whose first feature, \u201cMy Name Is Emily,\u201d was made in 2015. And the reason Farrell is speaking for him is not because, precisely, Fitzmaurice cannot. Strictly speaking, through his voice simulator, he can; but Fitzmaurice\u2014whose narration is adapted from a book that shares the title with this movie\u2014and director preferred Farrell\u2019s more robust tones. And the famous actor\u2019s participation has further value: it attaches a marquee name to this movie. And, probably much more importantly, it is the helpful gesture of a friend.  Advertisement Simon Fitzmaurice was diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease in 2008, and it has affected him to the extent that by the time this documentary was filmed, he was confined to a wheelchair, almost entirely paralyzed and reliant on an \u201ceye gaze\u201d computer to convey his thoughts. It was in this condition, incredibly, that he was able to direct \u201cMy Name Is Emily.\u201d This movie, directed by Frankie Fenton, tells Fitzmaurice\u2019s life story, one that is both heartbreaking and awe-inspiring.  As he sits in his wheelchair, his handsome, unlined-by-wrinkles face now framed by a dark, boxy beard, Fitzmaurice presents a visual enigma. It\u2019s wrenching when the movie shows still photographs and old video footage of his mobile self. Born in the 1970s into a family that loved movies, he got the writing bug early; his accounts of school, comradeship, early creative work, and love are both endearing and familiar. His elation at finding a soul mate, his wife Ruth (herself a writer) is infectious, as is his enthusiasm when his first short film is accepted to an NYU film festival, and his second gets to Sundance. There\u2019s a cute picture of Simon and Ruth standing outside the Ed Sullivan Theatre, seeing it, you think, there\u2019s a couple of out-of-towners you might have run into at a nearby bar and had a great time with over a few beers.  All seems to be going great, only while at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008, there with another short, he notices one of his feet feeling \u201cfloppy.\u201d Expecting a routine diagnosis from his doctor, he instead gets more or less a death sentence. He\u2019s told he only has three or four years to live. \u201cIs he talking about me?\u201d Fitzmaurice remembers thinking. This movie has some similarities, sadly, to \u201cGleason,\u201d a 2016 documentary about football player Steve Gleason and his trials and courage after getting ALS. \u201cIt\u2019s Not Yet Dark\u201d does not go into the same excruciating detail concerning the day-to-day challenges of being confined the way the Gleason picture does, but it is equally frank in showing that, as pragmatic and upbeat and positive as Simon and Ruth and their family and friends try to be as they go about life and work, the disease and its effects have emotionally gutted them all, and continues to do so. But there\u2019s never a \u201cI can\u2019t go on\u201d prefacing the \u201cI\u2019ll go on\u201d in Fitzmaurice\u2019s world. He is determined to realize \u201cEmily,\u201d and a crowd-funding campaign helps him do it. (Colin Farrell was among its most prominent boosters.) This movie shows how Fitzmaurice was able to direct the picture\u2014scheduling the shot so that he could efficiently marshal his energy was a big part of the process, as of course was the \u201ceye gaze\u201d computer. Fitzmaurice explains that he had to, of course, stop thinking about filmmaking in terms of \u201ccareer,\u201d potential or actual. This had a way of clarifying things. \u201cWhat remains is desire.\u201d I reviewed \u201cEmily\u201d for this website, and I wasn\u2019t crazy about it\u2014even though I acknowledged then that its existence is a miracle and should be celebrated as such. \u201cIt\u2019s Not Yet Dark\u201d did not change my opinion of the movie as such. But it made me hope hard that Simon Fitzmaurice gets to make another movie, and another after that, and so on.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
