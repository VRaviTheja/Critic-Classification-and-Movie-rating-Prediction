{"Title": "A Long Way Down", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "There are moments of tenderness and honest human emotion buried in the frustrating \u201cA Long Way Down\u201d but one has to work far too hard and give far too much credit to the over-qualified cast to grab at them. Based\r\non a hit book by Nick Hornby (\u201cHigh Fidelity,\u201d \u201cAbout a Boy\u201d) that contained an\r\nemotional minefield maudlin enough that the film took nearly a decade to come\r\ninto existence even though the Hornby bandwagon was full in the \u201800s, \u201cA Long\r\nWay Down\u201d is a textbook case of over-direction. Characters laugh too hard; the\r\nscore by Dario Marianelli alternates between wispy guitar strumming and\r\nheartstring-pulling piano tinkling; the suicidal characters literally dance to \u201cI\r\nWill Survive\u201d at one point. You get the idea. Honest emotion falls victim to\r\npoor filmmaking again. Advertisement Martin Sharp (Pierce Brosnan) wants to kill himself on New\r\nYear\u2019s Eve. He has tumbled from the height of popularity after a sex scandal\r\nwith an underage girl destroyed his family and sees no reason to go on if he\u2019s\r\nnot famous. He climbs to the roof of the Toppers Building, a notorious suicide\r\nspot; so notorious that he runs into three other people on this frosty, fateful\r\nevening. Maureen (Toni Collette) has a severely disabled son and can\u2019t go on.\r\nJess (Imogen Poots) is heartbroken and J.J. (Aaron Paul) tells his new mates\r\nthat he has brain cancer. The four agree to delay their life-ending until\r\nValentine\u2019s Day, keeping tabs on each other over the next month-and-a-half and,\r\nof course, forming a unique bond. When the \u201cTopper House Four\u201d is outed in the press (it turns\r\nout that Jess\u2019 dad is a famous politician, making her bait for tabloid\r\nheadlines), they become semi-celebrities. To escape the attention, they jet off\r\nto a resort, frolic in the surf, grow closer, learn the importance of life, get a tan,\r\netc.  \u201cA Long Way Down\u201d is a film that\u2019s afraid of its subject\r\nmatter: suicidal depression. One never senses any actual danger or urgency in\r\nthe plight of these characters to battle their demons before they kill them, and the lack of any sense that these people might actually end their lives drains the piece of drama.\r\nTheir depression is merely a plot device. J.J. was once the frontman for a band\r\ncalled Gepetto and he laughs about one of the hackneyed lines that he wrote: \u201cI\r\ndon\u2019t mind the pain, it\u2019s the hope that kills me.\u201d Writer Jack Thorne and\r\ndirector Pascal Chaumeil present the line as a bit of humor\u00a0about a wannabe\r\ngrunge band that never was\u00a0but it\u2019s indicative of the problem with the film. The movie never\r\nminds the pain. It doesn\u2019t pay attention to it. We don\u2019t feel it. Well, most of\r\nthe time. The always-great Collette somehow finds a way to make the most\r\nmaudlin and manipulative character arc of the quartet hit most of\u00a0the right beats. The\u00a0film's greatest value is further proof that Collette makes everything she's in better. \r\n\r\nTo be fair, Poots is quite good here as well, but both actresses\r\nare weighed down by a director who didn\u2019t trust them. Jess lying on her bed\r\nsinging the BeeGees classic \u201cTragedy\u201d should be done with a wink, not with a\r\ntreacly score underneath. When the foursome realizes they\u2019ve written their\r\nnon-suicide pact on the back of Maureen\u2019s suicide note, the actors have been\r\ndirected to laugh in response in an exaggerated, overblown way. It sounds\r\npicky, I know, but \u201cA Long Way Down\u201d never registers emotionally because it is\r\nconstantly reminding you it\u2019s a movie. And it\u2019s not a very good one.
