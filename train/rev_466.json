{"Title": "Jane", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Biographical documentaries of famous people are typically dull affairs, the kind of thing that falls into hagiography or the kind of talking-head, then-this-happened adoration more at home in the 60-minute television format on PBS than in a feature film. There are very few filmmakers who have defied this trend as completely as Brett Morgen, the director of \u201cKurt Cobain: Montage of Heck\u201d and \u201cThe Kid Stays in the Picture\u201d (about Robert Evans). He makes films that feel like extensions of his subject matters, channeling their creative spirit in the form of his filmmaking more than just detailing what happened in their lives. So it\u2019s cinematic justice that over a hundred hours of footage of Jane Goodall crossed paths with Brett Morgen, as both are pioneers in their field, and only Morgen seems capable of shaping that footage in such a unique, captivating, inspiring way as in \u201cJane,\u201d one of the best documentaries of the year so far. Advertisement \u201cJane\u201d is that rare documentary that works in equal measure for those who know a great deal about Jane Goodall and those people who don\u2019t know a thing. Most people probably think they know all they need to know about Jane Goodall. She watched chimps, right? Her research was essential to understanding not only the way we interact with the natural world but our place in it, but hers is not a name like Kurt Cobain that gets thrown around in conversations much in 2017. \u201cJane\u201d fully elevates the scientific pedestal on which Jane Goodall should be placed but it does so in part by humanizing her, revealing the challenges she faced and discoveries she made as more than mere National Geographic footage you might see in a Science class.    Morgen structures his film relatively chronologically, allowing Goodall to tell her own story as we see footage of her in the wild. There\u2019s a fascinating structural element of \u201cJane\u201d in that the footage doesn\u2019t contain interviews or dialogue, and so we\u2019re watching Jane, the chimps, and the other humans who would come to Gambe, in a way that\u2019s not dissimilar from the way Goodall observed her subjects. And there\u2019s the added sense of disconnected observation that comes with time, and in the manner that Goodall herself is analyzing her own story in the way that someone might analyze the actions of a family of chimps. The parallel is clearly intentional, especially as \u201cJane\u201d becomes more and more about how the lessons that Goodall learned in the wild informed her entire life, including even teaching her lessons about motherhood.    That\u2019s a theme of \u201cJane\u201d as we\u2019re introduced to Goodall\u2019s supportive mother in the opening scenes, see how Jane observes the motherhood of the chimps she\u2019s studying, and then see her maternal instincts on display with her own child. Morgen very subtly does this in his films\u2014drawing thematic undercurrents that move through the work without overriding the informative chronology of it all. There\u2019s a fluidity that can be breathtaking to watch, especially as that motion is accompanied by Philip Glass\u2019 best film score in years. You should be warned that it\u2019s \u201cvery Glass,\u201d and I found it somewhat overwhelming at first, but I quickly couldn\u2019t imagine the film working without it. It becomes an essential part of the film because of the aforementioned lack of an abundance of archival interviews, meaning that Goodall\u2019s modern voice and Glass\u2019 compositions become our primary sources for information and inspiration.    Advertisement \u201cJane\u201d is filled with fascinating anecdotes and insights, such as the fact that Goodall was never nervous about going to the wild to observe chimps because we didn\u2019t really know about the aggression of the species when she chose to do so. She didn\u2019t know to be scared (but would learn about the violence inherent in the chimp population). Goodall made headlines around the world when she filmed a chimp using a branch to obtain termites from a hole for nourishment. It may not seem like a big deal now, but it was once thought that humans were the only species to use tools, and the fact that a chimp used a branch as a tool shook the world, especially in the offices of religious leaders. The footage around the first time that Goodall really made contact with the chimps\u2014when they trusted her enough to get close\u2014is still breathtaking. It\u2019s incredible to consider that footage this old of a chimp taking a banana from a woman for the first time ever would make for one of the most unforgettable scenes of 2017. A baby chimp learning how to walk is on that list of 2017 images I won\u2019t forget as well.    Goodall herself is a forthcoming and fascinating interview subject\u2014another testament to Morgen\u2019s work as a narrator. \u201cJane\u201d feels like a film that couldn\u2019t have been made without the valuable insight gained through time. We see so many documentaries that want to be current and timely that they don\u2019t realize the value of chronological distance from a subject. In a sense, we\u2019re watching the impact of Goodall\u2019s evolution from a young adventurer to a groundbreaking scientist to a wife and mother. And it\u2019s through her self-analysis of that evolution that Morgen draws a line through fifty years of research and an entirely different species. As he has in his other films, he\u2019s saying to us that it is through these pioneers that we can see the best in ourselves and the potential of the human intellect and desire to learn. But he never loses his filmmaker\u2019s desire to entertain at the same time. It\u2019s that balance of both\u2014the genius of both the subject and the filmmaker\u2014that make \u201cJane\u201d such a rewarding experience.", "Critic": "Beta"}
