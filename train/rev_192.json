{"Title": "Triple 9", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "There are movies about ugly, vile people, and there are\r\nugly, vile movies. \u201cTriple 9\u201d is the latter. Turning his interest in macho nihilism that he explored more\r\neffectively in \u201cThe Proposition\u201d and even the flawed \u201cLawless\u201d to bank robbers and the Russian mob, director John\r\nHillcoat again assembles a stunning cast of household names and proceeds to\r\nwaste almost all of their talents on an under-lit, increasingly ridiculous,\r\ngenerally ineffective dirty cop movie. It is a film that cribs openly from\r\nMichael Mann and Sidney Lumet without understanding what really makes either\r\ndirector work. Occasionally, the overwhelming talent of the cast will elevate\r\nthe material, but not nearly enough to shake the feeling when it\u2019s done that\r\nyou could use a shower. Advertisement The best scene in \u201cTriple 9\u201d is arguably its first real\r\nset-piece, the robbery of a downtown Atlanta bank by former special ops\r\nmastermind Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor), dirty cop #1 Marcus Belmont\r\n(Anthony Mackie), dirty cop #2 Jorge Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.), getaway\r\nman Russel Welch (Norman Reedus), and his brother Gabe (Aaron Paul), a\r\ncharacter who might as well being wearing a red shirt and named \u201cFuture\r\nLiability.\u201d Hillcoat and cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis (\u201cThe Drop\u201d)\r\nframe the bank robbery beautifully, taking us from the high-pressure of the\r\nvault to the getaway gone wrong after a red dye pack explodes. It\u2019s tense,\r\nwell-shot and sets up the audience for a high stakes thriller that never comes. It turns out the quintet wasn\u2019t there for the money\u2014they were\r\ntasked with stealing a very specific safety deposit box by Russian mob mastermind\r\nIrina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet), who is now refusing to pay the group until they\r\nperform another job. Irina has control over Michael because Michael has a son\r\nwith Irina\u2019s sister Elena (Gal Gadot) that the Russians are basically holding\r\nhostage, not allowing his father to see him. This plot thread is not only\r\npoorly-developed, it\u2019s a little morally grotesque in that it feels designed to\r\ncreate sympathy for someone who should be a villain, especially when we learn\r\nwhat the title means. If you don\u2019t know, 999 is the code for \u201cofficer down.\u201d In their\r\nplanning of the second heist, which involves a Homeland Security building, the\r\ngroup decides that the best way to distract the rest of the force will be to\r\nkill a cop. As they say, every car responds to a triple nine. And they\u2019ll all be\r\ndistracted enough to not be able to respond to the new heist. Conveniently,\r\nMarcus gets a green new partner in Chris Allen (Casey Affleck). They\u2019ll set up\r\nAllen to get killed, and pull off one final job for Irina while the city is\r\ndescending on the crime scene. They never bother to consider that Allen\u2019s uncle\r\n(Woody Harrelson) is leading the investigation into who they are. Or that the\r\nincreasingly unstable Gabe is a problem. Or that their entire plan is based on a lot\r\nof coincidences and plot holes that we only see in movies. Advertisement Most of \u201cTriple 9\u201d is shot in close-up and near-total\r\ndarkness. Hillcoat and Karakatsanis mistakenly think that this will compensate\r\nfor a lack of character or plot worth caring about. So, we get sweaty, dirty,\r\ngrimy camerawork, under-lit to a nearly-parodic degree, but none of it\r\nresonates beyond showy filmmaking. The film is constantly calling attention to\r\nits visual style (or lack thereof) because there\u2019s so little else on which to\r\nfocus. Despite casting so many talented people, writer Matt Cook and Hillcoat\r\ngive them almost nothing to do. They are cogs in a plot machine with nothing notable\r\nabout their characters or back stories outside of the descriptions you read\r\nabove. Michael has a kid. Gabe is the junkie. Chris is the new guy. That is it. If Hillcoat is trying to say\r\nanything about macho male behavior, the police force, capitalism, or even the\r\nRussian mob, he fails to do so.  The forgettable thinness of the characters is problematic\r\nthroughout but especially in the final act when one realizes you just don\u2019t\r\ncare about these people or what\u2019s going to happen to them. If one subscribes to\r\nthe theory that people can learn as much from a bad movie as from a good one,\r\nwatch the scenes between two of our best actors\u2014Kate Winslet and Chiwetel\r\nEjiofor. Neither have the depth of character or artful purpose that these\r\ntwo have brought to films before. And so their relationship, one of the\r\ndefining ones of the film, has no resonance at all. To be fair, Anthony Mackie\r\nhas so much natural charisma that it shines through every now and then and\r\nCasey Affleck sometimes looks like he\u2019s aware of the better film in which this\r\ncharacter could play a crucial role. It\u2019s also worth noting that when character\r\nhas to take a back seat\u2014in a few action sequences, including a riveting gang shoot-out,\r\nthe movie works. It\u2019s when dialogue and an increasingly-ludicrous plot kicks in\r\nthat the movie fails in head-shaking ways. Every talented cast member will move on from the errors of \u201cTriple\r\n9\u201d and on to bigger and better things. Most of them have already. Follow their\r\nlead.", "Critic": "Beta"}
