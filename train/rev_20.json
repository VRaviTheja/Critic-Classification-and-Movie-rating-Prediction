{"Title": "Tomb Raider", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Based on the 2013 video game, and featuring Alicia Vikander as\u00a0the latest incarnation of a character who's been around for 22 years, \"Tomb Raider\" surprisingly\u00a0plays like a throwback to the classic late-'80s/early '90s\u00a0era of action filmmaking, represented by the likes of \"Cliffhanger,\" \"The Last of the Mohicans,\"\u00a0the first couple of Indiana Jones films, and Jackie Chan's \"Armour of God\" series. From the animated prologue, wherein the title character's archeologist father, Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), tells of an ancient, cursed tomb supposedly containing the all-powerful, weaponizable\u00a0remains of the Japanese shaman queen Himiko, through its gracefully executed series of chases and emotional moments, to its finale set on a Pacific island riddled with booby-trapped ruins, \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0is much better and more original\u00a0than anyone could have expected.\u00a0 Advertisement Although it borrows\u00a0from the game (and, partially, its sequel) for structure and most of its key\u00a0action sequences, \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0never feels like a pointless companion piece to a work that was created for a different medium. I've never played the game this film is adapting, but I\u00a0had a great time watching the movie it inspired, thanks mainly to the\u00a0direction; the stunt choreography, which leans on real performers and props whenever it makes sense to; the emphasis on problem-solving one's way out of tight situations; and most of all,\u00a0the actors, who flesh out archetypal\u00a0characters who might have seemed cliched or merely flat on the page, and make them as real as they can, considering what sort of movie they're in.\u00a0 First among equals is Alicia Vikander with her faintly regal bearing. She's correctly cast as a woman\u00a0who's literally to-the-manor-born, but the\u00a0humility and sense of fair play that she exudes\u00a0makes you like rather than resent the character.\u00a0More importantly, though, she's an action hero par excellence.\u00a0Carved like a wood sculpture, and seemingly bereft of body fat, Vikander hurls\u00a0herself into the film's action sequences. She makes you feel the physicality of this intensely visceral\u00a0performance, letting\u00a0out a high-pitched grunt of rage or pain when Lara crashes into a wall or\u00a0gets slammed on the ground by a brawny\u00a0foe, and letting sparks of fury flash in her eyes as Lara delivers a coup-de-grace. The movie has given a lot of thought to the question of\u00a0how a small woman could successfully fight opponents who are a lot\u00a0bigger and stronger than she is. The answers are relentless\u00a0speed, the strategic use of full body weight, and dirty fighting.\u00a0This is not to say that \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0is \"realistic\" in any sense, because no video game movie is\u2014at one point, Lara powers through after\u00a0a puncture wound that would put a 250-pound Green\u00a0Beret out of commission\u2014but that the filmmakers and Vikander are doing everything they can to sell the physical and emotional reality from moment to moment. Advertisement To that end, \"Tomb Raider\" is more emotionally demonstrative than films in this vein tend to be. As written by\u00a0Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons, there's\u00a0a strong element of domestic\u00a0melodrama at the heart of the tale: Lara's father went missing and is presumed dead. The movie gradually\u00a0fills out the\u00a0details of their relationship, balancing Lara's admiration, even worship, of her father\u00a0against the deep pain\u00a0caused by his frequent absences and ultimate disappearance. This is the story of a daughter learning from, surpassing, and ultimately forgiving\u00a0her dad\u2014a journey that hits fresher beats than you tend to get in genre films starring male heroes\u00a0whose fathers died, vanished, or disappointed them (although the third Indiana Jones movie deals in these themes, too).\u00a0 Paternal abandonment and its aftermath are at the heart of every character's story here.\u00a0Lu Ren (Daniel Wu), the alcoholic sea captain who ferries Lara to the island that contains Himiko's tomb, is dealing with his own daddy issues:\u00a0his same-named father once ran the boat, and ultimately vanished, too, which might account for why their relationship feels more brother-sister than romantic (they obviously\u00a0respect each other, but there's no sexual chemistry because the movie isn't interested in finding any). The bad guy, archaeologist turned corporate mercenary\u00a0Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins), is himself an absentee husband and father.\u00a0He's\u00a0spent seven years trying to locate Himiko's tomb at the behest of the mysterious Trinity organization, and feels great resentment toward the unseen master who's keeping him on the island\u00a0until he can complete\u00a0the job.\u00a0 Lara is an emotional person who has empathy for others and feels things deeply. I liked how you could hear the catch in her voice or see tears almost well up in her eyes as she deals with moments that cause her distress, because these details\u00a0affirm the validity of such a response, and confirm\u00a0that the movie isn't going to just graft a bunch of standard-issue, strong-silent tough guy cliches onto a female lead\u00a0and call it a day. There's more sensitivity and intelligence on display here\u00a0than there needed to be,\u00a0and while \"Tomb Raider\" doesn't go as far in this direction\u00a0as I\u00a0would've liked, the unmistakable effort means a lot. \u00a0Particularly striking is the moment after Lara kills someone for the first time: she sits next to the corpse for a long moment, looking psychically disturbed as well as physically exhausted. The act of\u00a0killing is presented in such a cavalier manner in so many action and adventure\u00a0films that it\u2019s a bit shocking to see it treated as if it means something. Advertisement In the end, though, this is a movie about a woman running, running, running, running, and then maybe\u00a0pausing just long enough to kill a man with a bow and arrow, defeat him in hand-to-hand combat, or solve a tumbler-styled puzzle that will open the stone door of a temple containing ancient treasures.\u00a0\"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0treats Vikander as a moving piece of sculpture, admiring her not in a sexually objectifying way,\u00a0but as one might an athlete.\u00a0When filming her in action, director Roar Uthaug (\"The Wave\")\u00a0often adopts the perspective of an especially kinetic videogame, shooting Vikander from a low angle as she races toward the camera, or from an elevated perspective looking at the back of her head and her shoulders, the better to appreciate Lara as she cuts a path through her world.\u00a0 There are at least five action sequences in this movie that rank with the best I've seen recently. The first is a\u00a0\"fox hunt\" on bicycles\u00a0through the streets of London which sees\u00a0Lara, who works as a\u00a0bike messenger before embracing her destiny as heir to her dad's legacy, leading a pack of her colleagues on a\u00a0chase through winding streets packed with cars and trucks. Another finds Lara diving off a cliff into a raging river; she catches herself before going over a waterfall by clinging to a rusted-out,\u00a0World War II-era bomber that's teetering\u00a0on its edge, then gradually moves over and through the rotting husk of the\u00a0plane, trying to get to the riverbank before the whole thing falls apart. (A great Indiana Jones-style moment: as she hears the buckling groan and sees the plane falling to pieces, she mutters, \"Really?\")\u00a0 There are frustrations here and there, mainly having to do with the plotting and some of the\u00a0supporting characters, who are lively and memorable but often lack one or two scenes that would've made them seem as mythically vivid as the material demands. (Vogel's misery is fascinating at first, but ultimately becomes tedious, and I\u00a0didn't like the way the film sidelined Ren during the final act.) Still, this is a beautifully crafted and unpretentious piece of action cinema, with a number of sequences that are as gorgeous as they are thrilling, and\u00a0a female hero who's as elegant\u00a0as she is deadly:\u00a0an ass-kicking Audrey Hepburn.
