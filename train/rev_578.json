{"Title": "The Revenant", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Great film has the power to convey the unimaginable. We sit\r\nin the comfort of a darkened theater or our living room and watch protagonists\r\nsuffer through physical and emotional pain that most of us can\u2019t really\r\ncomprehend. Too often, these endurance tests feel manipulative or, even worse,\r\nfalse. We\u2019re smart enough to \u201csee the strings\u201d being pulled, and the actor and\r\nset never fades away into the character and condition. What\u2019s remarkable about\r\nAlejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s \u201cThe Revenant\u201d is how effectively it transports\r\nus to another time and place, while always maintaining its worth as a piece of\r\nvisual art. You don\u2019t just watch \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d you experience it. You\r\nwalk out of it exhausted, impressed with the overall quality of the filmmaking\r\nand a little more grateful for the creature comforts of your life. Advertisement I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and co-writer Mark L. Smith set their tone early,\r\nstaging a breathtaking assault on a group of fur trappers by Native Americans,\r\nportrayed not just as \u201cenemies\u201d but a violent force of nature. While a few\r\ndozen men are preparing to pack up and move on to their next stop in the great\r\nAmerican wilderness, a scene out of \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d unfolds. Arrows pierce air\r\nand flesh as the few surviving men flee to a nearby boat. It turns out that the\r\ntribe is seeking a kidnapped daughter of its leader, and will kill anyone who\r\ngets in their way. At the same time, we learn that one of the trappers, Hugh\r\nGlass (Leonardo DiCaprio) has a half-Native American son named Hawk (Forrest\r\nGoodluck).  Low on men and hunted, the expedition\r\nleader Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) orders that their crew return to its\r\nbase, a fort in the middle of this snowy wilderness. John Fitzgerald (Tom\r\nHardy) disagrees, and the seeds of dissent are planted. He doesn\u2019t trust Henry,\r\nand he doesn\u2019t like Glass. In the midst of these discussions, Glass is away\r\nfrom the crew one day when he\u2019s brutally attacked by a bear\u2014the sequence is,\r\nwithout hyperbole, one of the most stunning things I\u2019ve seen on film in a long\r\ntime, heart-racing and terrifying. Glass barely survives the attack.\r\nIt seems highly unlikely that he\u2019ll make it back to the base. With increasingly\r\ndangerous conditions and a tribe of killers on their heels, they agree to split\r\nup. Most of the men will go back first while Fitzgerald, Hawk and a young man\r\nnamed Bridger (Will Poulter) will get a sizable fee to stay with Glass until he\r\ndies, giving him as much comfort as possible in his final days and the\r\nburial he deserves. Of course, Fitzgerald quickly tires of having to watch a man\r\nhe doesn\u2019t care about die. He kills Hawk in front of an immobile Glass and then\r\nbasically buries Hugh alive. As Bridger and Fitzgerald head back, Glass\r\nessentially rises from the dead (the word revenant means \u201cone that returns\r\nafter death or a long absence\u201d) and begins his quest for vengeance. With broken\r\nbones, no food, and miles to go, he pulls himself through snow and across\r\nmountains, seeking the man who killed his son. He is practically a ghost, a man\r\nwho has come as close to death as one possibly can but is unwilling to go to\r\nthe other side until justice is done. Advertisement The bulk of \u201cThe Revenant\u201d consists of this torturous\r\njourney, as Glass regains his strength and gets closer to home through sheer\r\nforce of will. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s Oscar-winning cinematographer for \u201cBirdman,\u201d Emmanuel Lubezki (who\r\nalso took a trophy for \u201cGravity\u201d the year before and could easily make it three\r\nin a row for this work) shoots \u201cThe Revenant\u201d in a way that conveys both the\r\nharrowing conditions and the artistry of his vision. The sky seems to go on\r\nforever; the horizon is neverending. He works in a color palette provided by\r\nnature, and yet enhanced. The snow seems whiter, the sky bluer. Many of his\r\nshots, especially in times of great danger like the opening attack and the bear\r\nscene, are unbroken\u2014placing us in the middle of the action. At other times, Lubezki\u2019s choices recall his work on \u201cThe\r\nTree of Life,\u201d especially in scenes in the second half when Glass\u2019s journey\r\ngets more mystical. And that\u2019s where the film falters a bit.\u00a0I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u00a0doesn\u2019t\r\nquite have a handle on those second-half scenes and the 156-minute running time\r\nbegins to feel self-indulgent as the film loses focus. When it centers on\r\nthe conditions and the tale of a man unwilling to die, it\u2019s mesmerizing. I just\r\nthink there\u2019s a tighter version, especially in the mid-section, that would be\r\neven more effective. About that man: So much has been made of this film being DiCaprio\u2019s\r\n\u201cOverdue Oscar\u201d shot that I feel like his actual work here will be undervalued.\r\nMake no mistake. Should he win, it will not be some \u201cLifetime Achievement\u201d win\r\nas we\u2019ve seen in the past for actors who we all thought should have won for\r\nanother film (Paul Newman, Al Pacino, etc.). He\u2019s completely committed in every terrifying moment, pushing himself further than he ever has\r\nbefore as an actor. Even just the physical demands of this protagonist would\r\nhave been enough to break a lot of lesser actors, but it\u2019s the way in which\r\nDiCaprio captures his internal fortitude that\u2019s captivating\u2014his body may be\r\nbroken, but we believe he is unwilling to give up.  Advertisement The minimal supporting cast is good, and it\u2019s nice to see\r\nGleeson continue to have an incredible 2015 (also in \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d \u201cEx Machina\u201d\r\nand \u201cStar Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens\u201d). Tom Hardy is less effective,\r\noften going a little too heavy on the tics (wide eyes, shot up-close), but I\r\nthink that\u2019s a fault of the direction and not one of our best actors. In the\r\nend, this is DiCaprio\u2019s film through and through, and he nails every\r\nchallenging beat, literally throwing himself into this character that\r\ndemands more of him physically than any other before.\u00a0 What would you do for vengeance? What conditions could you\r\nsurmount to get it? Or would you just give up? Our favorite films often drop\r\nquestions like these into our lives, allowing us to appreciate the world a\r\nlittle differently than before we saw them. \u201cThe Revenant\u201d has this power. It\r\nlingers. It hangs in the back of your mind like the best classic parables of\r\nman vs. nature. It will stay there for quite some time.", "Critic": "Beta"}
