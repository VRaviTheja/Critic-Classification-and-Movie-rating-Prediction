{"Title": "She's Funny That Way", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cLike most people today, Judy was a cynic and was offended\r\nby the slightest hint of fantasy.\u201d So reads a portion of the opening text of\r\nthe new movie directed and co-written (with his now former wife, Louise\r\nStratten) by Peter Bogdanovich. This clunky observation, I think, misreads the\r\nmodern or post-modern condition rather grievously. Cynicism today is in fact\r\nfed by fantasy, or at least delusion; it\u2019s a mask that affects to connote a\r\nreckoning with The Real, which in fact merely enables its wearers to distract\r\nthemselves from the true horror of the world as it is today. But anyway.  Advertisement Judy, played by Illeana Douglas, is a Hollywood reporter,\r\ninterviewing newly minted star Isabella Patterson, or \u201cIzzy\u201d who, as played by\r\nthe nonetheless appealing Imogen Poots, speaks with a thick approximation of a\r\nBrooklyn accent that\u2019s meant to evoke Judy Holliday in \u201cBorn Yesterday\u201d or\r\n\u201cBells Are Ringing\u201d but doesn\u2019t even get within swinging distance of Madonna in\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s That Girl.\u201d Accents aren\u2019t even the main problem with \u201cShe\u2019s Funny,\u201d in\r\nwhich Bogdanovich tries to merge the multiple-New-York-storylined romantic comedy\r\nantics of his underappreciated 1981 masterpiece (yes, it is) \u201cThey All Laughed\u201d\r\nwith the backstage-at-the-theatre-full-of-lunatics antics of \u201cNoises Off.\u201d The\r\nmovie sure is good-hearted enough. It\u2019s a labor of love, it would seem, for all\r\ninvolved. Several younger-filmmaker admirers of Bogdanovich\u2014the one-time tyro\r\nbehind \u201cThe Last Picture Show\u201d and other outstanding films of the \u201cEasy Riders,\r\nRaging Bulls\u201d era\u2014teamed up here to produce the long-gestating picture. Noah\r\nBaumbach, Wes Anderson and George Drakoulias are all credited as executive\r\nproducers. Their clout, plus Bogdanovich\u2019s reputation, and the goodwill he\u2019s\r\ngarnered over years of working as an actor, no doubt helped pull together a\r\nwonderful cast, including Owen Wilson, Kathryn Hahn, Rhys Ifans, Will Forte,\r\nJennifer Aniston, Austin Pendleton, and a lifeboat\u2019s worth of recognizable\r\ncameo players. On paper, the premise of the movie is not untenable. Owen\r\nWilson plays theater director Arnold, in New York after working on a Hollywood\r\npicture, about to embark on a new stage project starring superstar pal Seth\r\n(Ifans), Arnold\u2019s own wife Delta (Hahn), and a supporting player in the role of\r\na hooker to be named later. Speaking of hookers, Arnold\u2019s got a weird habit: he\r\nlikes to solicit call girls, take them to a nice dinner, boink the bejesus out\r\nof them (\u201cYou are the most\u2026attentive kinda lover,\u201d Izzy says to Arnold after\r\ntheir sole amorous pairing) and then gift them with $30,000, telling them to\r\ngive up The Life and go pursue their dreams. He couches this pitch around a\r\nspeech featuring the catchphrase \u201cSquirrels to the nuts,\u201d which had at one\r\npoint been the title of the movie. One marvels at a world in which even the\r\nmost successful of contemporary theater directors could repeatedly depart with\r\n30 large with such indiscrimination.\u00a0 And that\u2019s part of the problem with this\r\nmovie. Despite its preponderance of mullets among its younger players, \u201cThey\r\nAll Laughed\u201d was at least a little conversant enough with the then-realities of\r\nNew York City life; as such, it could present a recognizable world. The level\r\nof \u201cfantasy\u201d to which this movie actively aspires is so idealistic as to be\r\nlaughable, but not in an entirely good way. Old-movie lover Izzy at one point\r\nsays to Judy, about a playwright who falls in love with her, \u201cHe was exactly\r\nwhat I imagined a playwright to be, and he was the Arthur Miller to my\r\nMarilyn.\u201d No, no, a thousand times no. Too many times the characters in this\r\nmovie sprint across the line separating quirky charm from know-somethingish affectation,\r\nand then stay on the wrong side of it.  Advertisement And this erodes the sunny farcical\r\ntone to which \u201cShe\u2019s Funny That Way\u201d\r\naspires. It\u2019s as if somewhere along the way this wannabe champagne got spiked\r\nwith eager-to-please bennies. There are some good, funny bits, one involving a\r\ncab driver\u2019s vivid protest against having to sit through a feuding couple\u2019s\r\ndisagreement. Aniston\u2019s reluctant therapist character, weirdly shrill at first,\r\nactually gets funnier over the course of the movie, while Wilson underplays nicely\r\nthroughout. He could have been the picture\u2019s anchor, but the frenetic\r\nmachinations of the plot spin it away from him. Then there\u2019s the finale, in\r\nwhich the viewer ignorant of old movies gets a vivid primer in Lubitsch from a\r\nreal-life filmmaker and film buff. It\u2019s kind of cute and kind of\u2026weird, which\r\nwould be fine, only it doesn\u2019t know how weird it is. Given the narrow range of\r\nthis movie\u2019s overall achievement, I imagine its preaching here will only reach\r\nthe already converted.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
