{"Title": "Far from Men", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Albert Camus\u2019 short story, \u201cThe Guest,\u201d rather resembles\r\nErnest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Killers\u201d in that it uses an almost anecdotal storyline\r\nto illuminate major\u2014hell, one might even say \u201cexistential\u201d\u2014themes. Camus\u2019 work\r\nhas only three characters: a police officer, his prisoner, and a schoolteacher\r\nthe police officer charges with taking said prisoner to a court and jail a\r\ncouple of hours away. The teacher\u2019s refusal sets the tale in motion,\r\ndemonstrating how choice is destiny, but sometimes choice is not an option.\r\nHemingway\u2019s somehow even sparser story focuses on its two title characters, and\r\na man called The Swede, their victim, who offers his murderers no resistance;\r\nrecounted second hand, the tellers of the tale ponder The Swede\u2019s stoic\r\nacceptance of his fate.  Advertisement \u201cThe Killers\u201d was made into a movie in the late \u201840s, one\r\nthat extrapolated The Swede\u2019s backstory in full. A pretty great film noir\r\ndirected by Robert Siodmak and starring Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner. But an\r\nalmost entirely different animal in spirit than Hemingway\u2019s great story.\r\nSimilarly, writer/director David Oelhoffen expands the parameters of Camus\u2019\r\nstory, set in Algeria in the early \u201850s, in \"Far From Men\".\u00a0 Schoolteacher Daru, a quiet,\r\nself-possessed man, is played by Viggo Mortensen; his charge, Mohamed, by Reda\r\nKateb. This expansion of the story sees Daru escorting Mohamed even as he\r\nencourages the prisoner to break away. As the two men grow to trust each other,\r\nthe impossibility of Mohamed\u2019s situation is illuminated. Yes, he is guilty of a\r\ncrime. The crime, he says, was the result of a him-or-me-and-my-family\r\ndecision. Left to hang by themselves, though, his actions will create an endless\r\nand destructive cycle of recrimination. If he escapes, he insists, nothing will\r\nbe solved. Only his own sacrifice will make things right. \u201cGetting killed by\r\nthe French is the only solution.\u201d  Daru has a hard time grasping this. Their journey offers other\r\nchallenges as it progresses. There is rain. The Algerian rebellion against\r\nFrench rule had begun. It hasn\u2019t had much impact on the mountain village where\r\nDaru teaches, but Daru and Mohamed meet some soldiers on their trip, which\r\nprovides an opportunity for some backstory. It also recalls, in a low-key way,\r\nan episode from Leone\u2019s \u201cThe Good, The Bad, And The Ugly.\u201d There is a very understated brothel,\r\nrecollecting \u201cThe Last Detail.\u201d There is a lot of stark natural beauty,\r\ncaptured very well by cinematographer Guillame Deffontaines. And there is\u2026not a\r\nlot more, as it happens.\u00a0 In addition to muffing the d\u00e9nouement of the story on\r\nwhich it\u2019s based, \u201cFar From Men\u201d is also the kind of movie in which sobriety and a stalwart sense of seriousness yield more inertia than profundity. Its solemnity\r\nnever becomes actively oppressive, but it shuts out not just humor but grace.\r\nWhat it falls back on, rather than the troubling truth illuminated in Camus\u2019\r\nstory, is the movie-standard gaze of compassion, here proffered by Mortensen,\r\nwho, it must be admitted, does it well. His French isn\u2019t bad either, although\r\nhis character gets a backstory that explains its sometimes halting quality\r\n(French natives are worse sticklers for accents than American movie critics, as\r\nit happens). His work, and Kateb\u2019s, are exemplary. It\u2019s also pleasant to see\r\nthe great Angela Molina, so memorable in Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s final film \u201cThat Obscure\r\nObject of Desire,\u201d pop up here in a small role. But the movie remains something\r\nof a Distinguished Slog. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
