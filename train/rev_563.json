{"Title": "Caf\u00e9 Society", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In both his work and his interviews, Woody Allen shows a\r\nquietly insistent cynicism (he would say \u201crealism\u201d) about the futility of human\r\nendeavor in a meaningless, godless universe, and stuff. There is one aspect of\r\nearthly existence for which he has a demonstrable soft spot, however, and that\r\nis The Past. Which is possibly the reason that his most recent films set there\u2014\u201cMidnight\r\nin Paris\u201d and this week\u2019s \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d\u2014are among the most beguiling in his\r\nongoing late work.  The opening image of \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d sets the tone: a\r\nbreathtaking shot of an impossibly clear-blue swimming pool at dusk, surrounded\r\nby elegant people in formal wear. Allen, production designer Santo Loquasto,\r\nand cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (the legendary camera maestro here\r\nworking, as is Allen, for the first time in the digital format, and knocking it\r\nout of the park) have a very particular vision of 1930s Hollywood, despite\r\nAllen\u2019s well-known and well-worn antipathy toward Los Angeles in general. It is\r\nhere, Allen tells us in his voiceover narration, that talent agent Phil Stern\r\n(Steve Carell), seen at poolside \u201cholding court\u201d before being interrupted by a\r\nphone call, is a major player and contented fat cat. The phone call is from his\r\nolder sister Rose (Jeannie Berlin), matriarch of a clan right out of Allen\u2019s\r\n1987 \u201cRadio Days,\u201d informing him that her youngest son Bobby (Jesse Eisenberg)\r\nis headed out to the West Coast, and that Phil should help set him up, despite\r\nthe fact that the energetic young man hasn\u2019t the faintest idea of what he wants\r\nto do.  Advertisement Speaking of \u201cRadio Days,\u201d Allen limns Bobby\u2019s family with\r\nthe same anecdotal detail that he used to such great effect in the older film.\r\nBobby\u2019s sister Evelyn (Sari Lennick) is married to a philosophical academic,\r\nwhile his older brother Ben (Corey Stoll) is an aggressive gangster. How all\r\nthis will come to bear on Bobby\u2019s adventures a whole continent away we have no\r\nidea, but Allen\u2019s discursive mode is not unpleasant, and it does in fact pay\r\noff, albeit in an oblique way.  As for Bobby himself, Eisenberg initially plays him as a\r\nyoung Allen stand-in, albeit a little more New York street-smart and self\r\ndetermined. Uncle Phil is so busy, and/or uninterested, in giving his nephew\r\nthe time of day that he doesn\u2019t see him for a week, during which time Bobby\r\ndecides, with long-distance encouragement from Ben, to sample the local\r\ncall-girl culture, leading to a \u201cDeconstructing Harry\u201d-reminiscent scene that\u2019s\r\none of the movie\u2019s few sour notes, Anna Camp\u2019s game efforts as an inexperienced\r\nprostitute notwithstanding. Once Phil does see the fellow, he makes him an\r\nerrand boy, and outsources overseeing his social life to agency secretary\r\nVeronica, or Vonnie, played by a luminous Kristen Stewart. Together they sample\r\nHollywood Mexican food, the edenic sands of Malibu, and ornate movie houses\r\nshowing pristine prints of Barbara Stanwyck movies. What a paradise it seems,\r\nexcept that Bobby falls hopelessly in love with Vonnie and Vonnie\u2019s got a\r\nmysterious boyfriend. One who\u2019s almost never around because, for one thing,\r\nhe\u2019s a married man, and for another\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t want to give anything away, but if you don\u2019t\r\nsee what\u2019s coming, you haven\u2019t seen many Woody Allen films. While predictable\r\nin certain respects, \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d surprises in others, one of which is the\r\n\u201clife goes on\u201d swerve it makes midway through, one by which, among other\r\nthings, its title is justified. Bobby and Vonnie\u2019s separate lives see Bobby\r\ntaking over management of a swank New York nightclub owned by his gangster\r\nbrother and Vonnie becoming a Hollywood wife. That they never really got over\r\neach other is the theme of the movie\u2019s languid, lyrical and sad final third.  When I saw \u201cIrrational Man,\u201d Allen\u2019s film prior to this, in\r\n2015, it occurred to me that Allen has achieved something I never would have\r\npredicted, and he himself might have never dared hope: he is, at this point in\r\nhis career, a better director than he is writer. The plot twists and dialogue\r\nof \u201cIrrational Man\u201d were familiar to the point of near-hoariness, but Allen\u2019s\r\nwork with his actors, his shot selection and his pacing were supple and fleet,\r\nand made the movie more effective than it would seem to have had the right to\r\nbe. \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d has sharper writing than \u201cIrrational Man\u201d (although the\r\nlongtime Allen follower will hear more than one recycled gag, including one\r\nfrom, of all pictures, the 1967 \u201cCasino Royale\u201d), and when it doesn\u2019t, his cast\r\nis motivated enough to bring it off; as tired as the movie\u2019s already oft-quoted\r\nline about life being written by a \u201csadistic comedy writer\u201d is, Eisenberg makes\r\nit work in context. (Eisenberg\u2019s performance here, by the way, is one of his\r\nbest in a while. After the one-two punch of \u201cEnd of the Tour\u201d and \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d I almost expected to never enjoy his work again, but he does some\r\npretty special things here; his reaction to seeing Vonnie again, unexpectedly,\r\nafter a long time apart, is one of them.)  Advertisement But it\u2019s the filmmaking around the writing that casts a\r\nparticular spell. Particularly near the end, as Allen adds up the moral\r\nfailings and squelched desires and doused dreams of all his characters. (The\r\ndirector provides voiceover narration throughout, and while his timing and\r\ninflection are on point as ever, his voice is frail, weakening; for the first\r\ntime in a film, he sounds like the person he is, an 80-year-old man.) And then\r\nhe wraps the whole thing up at a New Year\u2019s celebration that\u2019s as visually\r\nbeautiful as the pool party at the film\u2019s opening but is at the same time\r\ninfused with a powerful but still wistful cinematic incense of paradise lost.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
