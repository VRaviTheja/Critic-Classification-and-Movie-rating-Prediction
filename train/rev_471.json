{"Title": "The Great Gilly Hopkins", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "If you\u2014or, more likely, someone you love, but I shouldn\u2019t presume in any event\u2014are in the market for an effective Young Adult tearjerker, \u201cThe Great Gilly Hopkins\u201d will get the job done. Directed by Stephen Herek from David Paterson\u2019s adaptation of Katherine Paterson\u2019s YA novel, \u201cThe Great Gilly Hopkins\u201d is a spectacularly foursquare \u201cfamily is what you make it\u201d redemption story. The kind of thing that film critics like to dismiss as \u201clooking like a made-for-TV movie,\u201d as if that comparison/analogy even holds as a dismissal anymore.  Advertisement Which is not to say that the movie as it stands has any real cinematic distinction. Director Herek brings his \u201cMr. Holland\u2019s Opus\u201d game here, but if you\u2019ve spent any time with the filmmaker\u2019s body of work, you already know that his \u201cBill & Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure\u201d game is not appreciably edgier. The man knows how to lay out whatever he\u2019s called upon to lay out. That is, coherently. For any emotional content he leaves things to his actors.  He\u2019s got a good bunch of them here. Canadian teen actor Sophie N\u00e9lisse plays the title role, a young girl in foster care who we know is not terribly well-off emotionally because her hair is so flat. Her attitude stinks, too. Dropped off by a child services worker at the house of beaming kindly Christian Maime Trotter (Kathy Bates in milk-of-human-kindness mode), Gilly behaves in such an immediately insufferable fashion that you\u2019re practically rooting for her to get kicked out on to the street. (Or for Bates to get some of her Annie Wilkes mojo back.) Gilly terrifies the emotionally damaged little boy who\u2019s also living in the ramshackle but warm-hearted house. She literally steals from the blind man living across the street, a kindly fellow played beautifully by Bill Cobbs. The movie, naturally, wants to have things both ways, so Gilly is also depicted as having terrific pluck\u2014she\u2019s pretty badass with the male bullies at her school, too.  And of course, behind all this is the revelation that she ain\u2019t no delinquent, she\u2019s misunderstood. All Gilly really wants is a real family life with her mom, who abandoned her as an infant and whose life she imagines as spectacularly glamorous. (That said mom is played by Julia Stiles, giving this critic the first strong \u201cMan, am I old\u201d shiver that he\u2019s had at a screening since, well, forever.) This excuse did not, for this viewer, contain as much water as it was intended to. For instance, Gilly finds herself doing better in school than she intended\u2014her strategy has been to get kicked out of every situation in which she\u2019s been placed, the better to free herself for Mom Pursuit\u2014and so decides to alienate her African-American schoolteacher (Octavia Spencer) by PRETENDING to be racist. The thing about pretend racism is that, in order to pull it off (imagining that you would want to, of course), you have to say and/or do actual racist things, which are ugly and hard to forgive. I suppose this plot point is indicative of a desire to make contemporary family/redemption tales more relevant/realistic/pertinent, but I found the whole episode just plain ugly, despite the teacher\u2019s humane reaction and Spencer\u2019s as-ever expert depiction of it.  Gilly is found out, in a sense, just as she\u2019s beginning to appreciate the good thing she\u2019s got in Trotter and the kid and the nice blind man and all. And then along comes the Third Act Glenn Close Surprise Plot Twist. A monkey wrench is once more thrown into Gilly\u2019s schemes, and a final confrontation with Pursued Mom ensues\u2014Stiles shows up so fleetingly that one is surprised she doesn\u2019t split by saying, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got another Bourne movie to get to.\u201d Still, the climax gets its redemptive job done. And Gilly gets a very becoming new hairstyle in the bargain.  Did I find myself getting a little choked up by the end? I did. It\u2019s a great cast that knows its business. If it can get someone who\u2019s so out of its core demographic a little verklempt, imagine what it can do for someone who\u2019s a target for such fare. Arrange your moviegoing weekend accordingly.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
