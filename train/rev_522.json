{"Title": "They're Watching", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "I kind of knew this movie was trouble from the opening two\r\nminutes. First of all, it opens in medias\r\nres, sort of: a young woman screaming and running about at the edge of a\r\nforest at night, and then, boom, she gets an axe right in the forehead, and\u2014of\r\ncourse\u2014the axe stays there, and she runs toward the camera. And then there\u2019s\r\nthe opening title, which is in pretty much the exact same typeface as the logo\r\nfor the John Carpenter classic \u201cThey Live.\u201d I know winking homages tend to be\r\nthe glue that holds contemporary genre films together, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\r\nhave to like it. And yes, I know that Joe Dante, a director I admire and you\r\nought to as well, packs his movies with clever in-joke references, but he does\r\nit with panache and wit and doesn\u2019t nudge you in the ribs about the whole\r\nthing.  Advertisement \u201cThey\u2019re Watching\u201d then gets worse, with a pastiche of a\r\n\u201cHouse Hunters\u201d-style cable TV program, this one chronicling the search of a\r\ndippy Californian of a certain age (Brigid Brannagh) looking for a domicile in\r\nMoldava, an Eastern European country of spooky antiquity. The local color is\r\nprovided via a native real estate agent named Vladimir; actor Dimitri\r\nDiatchenko applies all the subtlety of an average \u201cYacht Rock\u201d sketch performer\r\nto his role here. Once the episode concludes with Brannagh\u2019s Becky settling on\r\na decrepit house that gives new meaning to the term \u201cfixer-upper,\u201d we go\r\nforward a few months. And, if you\u2019re me, you are dismayed to learn that this\r\nwhole movie is going to be another found-footage deal, because now we\u2019re in a\r\nvan with three crew members of the househunting show, back in Moldava for the\r\nfollowup. There\u2019s Alex (Kris Lemche) the obnoxious nerdy sexist motormouth;\r\nGreg (David Alpay), the quieter studly guy; and Sarah (Mia Faith), a producer\u2019s\r\nniece who went to film school and is attractive. You see the dynamic that\u2019s\r\ngoing to develop here, which gains more \u201cintrigue\u201d when Alex reveals that\r\nGreg has been to Afghanistan. Adding to the volatility of the mix is the show\u2019s\r\nostensible bitch-on-wheels host Kate (Carrie Genzel) who likes nothing more to\r\nshriek invective at her subordinates. And there\u2019s a lot of invective to be shrieked. Co-writers\r\nand co-directors Jay Lender and Micah Wright take a full half hour to even\r\nbegin introducing the plot points that are going to result in folks getting\r\ntheir heads split open with axes. Greg and Sarah excite some hostility from the\r\nlocals by crashing a funeral with their cameras on, but the real eye-opener is\r\nthe miracle of Becky\u2019s house, which is now a beautifully decorated and\r\nappointed cottage. Something odd, and involving frogs, is afoot. Will we ever\r\nfind out? Will Greg ever reveal his Afghanistan story? We all know the answers\r\nto these questions.  The movie\u2019s incredibly irritating characters made me\r\nremember why I only ever needed to watch \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d once, and\r\nits hobbling, dopey, drawn-out plotlines and xenophobic thematic threads made\r\nme think very, very kind thoughts about Eli Roth\u2019s \u201cHostel\u201d movies, which at\r\nleast have ruthless efficiency going for them. Once the movie\u2019s horror\r\npyrotechnics are set off, the special effects sometimes have the feel of a\r\nCharles Band production for the 1980s, that is, for those not familiar with\r\nthat output, kind of pleasantly cheesy and \u2026 well, pleasantly cheesy, that\u2019s all.\r\nAn hour and fifteen minutes of tedium is too long to wait for two or three\r\nminutes of pleasantly cheesy.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
