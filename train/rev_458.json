{"Title": "O.J.: Made in America", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\u201cWe talk about OJ as though the story is OJ. The story is OJ\r\nAND US.\u201d\r\n\u2014Celia Farber Even in this era of \u201cPeak TV,\u201d it\u2019s rare to see something as\r\nessential and momentous as ESPN\u2019s \u201cOJ: Made in America,\u201d which played film festivals earlier this year and starts this\r\nSaturday, June 11th, and runs all of next week under the network\u2019s \u201c30\r\nFor 30\u201d brand. Ezra Edelman\u2019s stunningly ambitious, eight-hour documentary is a\r\nmasterpiece, a refined piece of investigative journalism that places the\r\nsubject it illuminates into the broader context of the end of the 20th\r\ncentury. You may think you know everything about The Trial of the Century,\r\nespecially if you watched FX\u2019s excellent \u201cThe People vs. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story,\u201d but \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d not only fills in details about the case but\r\noffers background and commentary that you\u2019ve never heard before. It is an\r\nexamination of race, domestic abuse, celebrity, civil rights, the LAPD, the\r\nlegal process and murder over the last fifty years, using the OJ Simpson story\r\nas a way to refract society. Its length may seem daunting, but I would have\r\nwatched it for another eight hours and will almost certainly watch it again before\r\nthe summer is over. It\u2019s that good. Advertisement As broadcast, \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d is split up into five parts.\r\nThe first part plays like a relatively straightforward \u201c30 For 30,\u201d the ESPN\r\nbrand that has delivered fantastic sports documentary filmmaking. It focuses on\r\nthe rise of OJ Simpson, becoming a household name at USC, where he won the\r\nHeisman Trophy in 1968. Edelman very carefully places the rise of Simpson\r\nagainst the backdrop of what was happening to the other black sports figures at\r\nthe time. He includes footage of Muhammad Ali refusing to go to Vietnam and\r\nTommie Smith and John Carlos raising their fists in protest at the 1968\r\nOlympics. OJ was a \u201csafe\u201d black athlete, and even intercuts footage of RFK\r\nannouncing the death of Martin Luther King with Simpson joining Bob Hope on\r\nstage as the host congratulates USC on not having \u201chad a riot, a demonstration,\r\nor even a sit-in.\u201d While black people were trying to change the world, OJ\r\nSimpson went in another direction, and he very verbally and consciously did so,\r\nusing that acceptance to become the first black spokesman for several\r\ncompanies. As someone says, \u201cOJ Simpson was the counter-revolutionary athlete.\u201d\r\nThe key here is that OJ Simpson was already writing a character, responding\r\nmore to how people saw him than anything else. If \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d was just part one, it would be a\r\nfascinating, must-see examination of how celebrity and race worked together in\r\nthe late \u201860s and \u201870s. The second part of \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d chronicles the\r\ninstantly-tumultuous relationship between OJ and Nicole Brown. A friend says\r\nthat her pants were ripped after her first date with OJ and that she said that \u201che\r\ngot a little rough.\u201d At this point, Edelman pivots to a story of how celebrity\r\ncan let people get away with domestic abuse, while also focusing on the state\r\nof race relations in Los Angeles in the \u201880s and \u201890s. As the relationship\r\nbetween the Los Angeles Police Department and minorities in L.A. continued to\r\nheat up, Rodney King became the international example of the violence cops were\r\ninflicting on black people, and, eventually and more importantly, injustice. If\r\nyou\u2019re wondering how or why Rodney King\u2019s beating plays a role in \u201cOJ: Made in\r\nAmerica,\u201d know that one of the jurors in Simpson\u2019s trial later states that she\r\nlet OJ go as revenge for Rodney King. And she\u2019s convinced others did as well. Racist\r\ncops\u2014like those that beat Rodney King and Mark Fuhrman, who the defense argued\r\nframed OJ Simpson\u2014needed to know those days were over. What\u2019s so incredible\r\nabout \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d is how Edelman and his team basically define the\r\nfoundation of what would come in the trial. They don\u2019t jump into the \u201csalacious\r\ndetails.\u201d Nothing as major as the story of OJ Simpson happens in a vacuum. How\r\ndid OJ get there? How did Nicole get there? How did Mark Fuhrman, Chris Darden\r\nand Johnnie Cochran get there? How did we all get there? Of course, the third and fourth part of \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d is\r\ndevoted to the trial, and they do an incredible job of distilling it to essential beats, with notable contributions by Marcia Clark, Gil Garcetti, two\r\njurors and several witnesses, including some of OJ Simpson\u2019s friends, all of\r\nwhom either at that point or today admit that he did it. The details of the\r\nentire piece are what elevate it\u2014eyewitness accounts of the Bronco chase from\r\nthe cops who essentially accompanied a man with a murder charge pending to his\r\nhome (think about that in terms of race and celebrity and ask yourself if they\r\nwouldn\u2019t have just shot out the tires of every other black man in L.A.). The\r\ncops that day went into OJ\u2019s house and saw only pictures of him on the walls.\r\nNo Nicole. No kids. So, they knew they could appeal to his ego to stop him from\r\nkilling himself in that Bronco in his own driveway, where he had a gun under\r\nhis chin.\u00a0 Advertisement These kind of \u201cyou are there\u201d details are riveting, but that's not meant to imply that this is merely a compendium of little-known facts. What really separates \"OJ: Made in America,\" other than its investigative spirit, is the brilliant connections Edelman and his team make through editing. We hear a fascinating story about friends trying to play a prank on a young OJ Simpson and Al \"AC\" Cowlings in which they pulled a starter pistol and AC jumped to protect his best friend. Of course, cut to the Bronco chase, in which AC could have been the last man to see OJ alive if Simpson had done what he intended at several points that day. The attention to detail and brilliant documentary construction carries over to the case as well, where mistakes were made from the very beginning, everywhere but the defense. Edelman paints a portrait of a judge with little control (for no logical reason, he let them walk the jury through Rockingham, where Simpson's team had replaced photos of Juice with his white friends with only black people and African art) and a prosecution team always at least a few steps behind not just their opponents but the world. They didn't comprehend the \"bigger picture\" of fame and race. Here\u2019s\r\njust one of the breathtaking stats in terms of the power of celebrity: 75% of\r\nthe jurors in the questioning period thought that OJ Simpson was unlikely to do\r\nit because he had played football at USC. Marcia Clark drastically overestimated\r\nher likability with black women and ended up with eight on her jury. And OJ\r\nSimpson wasn\u2019t your typical defendant. He knew exactly how to play things. He\r\nwas a part of his defense team. He even knew to stop taking his arthritis\r\nmedicine\u2014which would swell up his hands\u2014two weeks before the testimony about\r\nthe gloves, just in case Chris Darden would ask him to try them on. And we all\r\nknow what happened there. An hour into part four, there\u2019s a detailed recounting of\r\nexactly what happened the night that Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman died, with\r\nbrutal crime scene photos. The horror and violence of that night is jawdropping\r\nand as terrifying as any horror movie. The doc gets graphic, and I started to\r\nget emotional not just because of the impact of the crime but because I\r\nrealized I didn\u2019t know these details before. I interned at a news station\r\nduring the original case and I was as enraptured with the story as anyone but\r\nthe actual horror of the crime was distracted by conspiracy theories and the\r\nblinding light of fame.  Advertisement The final part of \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d is the only one in which\r\nI can find the slightest flaw in that I wish it was a bit longer. After being\r\nacquitted, OJ Simpson lost his exalted status. He was no longer allowed in the\r\ncountry clubs at which he was formerly the only black member. He was yelled at everywhere\r\nhe went, essentially descended into a life of drugs and violence, which\r\nwould result in his conviction for armed robbery. But he was always obsessed with his image. There\u2019s\r\nan incredible scene in which OJ is taking down the flag at Rockingham, getting\r\nemotional and then pushing the camera away as if a paparazzi had snuck onto\r\nthe grounds. It was staged. Any footage of OJ at the time could be sold to TMZ\r\nfor a pretty penny and Simpson was making money with a buddy, even as his world\r\nwas crashing around him.\u00a0 Whether he was running for a record, leaping through\r\nan airport for Hertz, making sure Nicole knew that she was his property or\r\ngetting angry enough to kill, it was always about OJ and only OJ. To understand\r\nOJ, we have to understand how much of his life was influenced by what he showed\r\nus in the world of celebrity and how we responded to it as a society. \u201cOJ: Made\r\nin America\u201d should be a conversation-starter, a way to discuss what happened in\r\nthe \u201880s and \u201890s in terms of race and celebrity and what it says about today.\r\nOJ\u2019s story may be over.
