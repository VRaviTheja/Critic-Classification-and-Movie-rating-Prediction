{"Title": "A Monster Calls", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "A lot of colleagues seem to have been under the impression\u2014maybe because of the title combined with the fact that director J.A. Bayona made \u201cThe Orphanage\u201d\u2014that this is a straight-up genre film, a conventional monster movie. Boy, were they ever surprised by \u201cA Monster Calls,\u201d which is in fact a metaphorical allegory of childhood, illness, death, and grief. And an often very powerful film. Based on a novel by Patrick Ness, who also wrote the screenplay (the book itself was initially conceived as an idea by the late writer Siobhan Dowd, who is also credited in the film), \u201cA Monster Calls\u201d brings viewers into the ramshackle British household of young Conor and his unnamed mother. Their residence looks out onto a church and graveyard that seem guarded by a giant yew tree. Conor (Lewis MacDougall), a restless, shy, bullied kid who\u2019s an ardent daydreamer, artist\u2014and inchoate monster-movie lover\u2014dreams one night of the tree breaking apart, and yielding a giant man of wood. Tree-men and like figures have deep roots (sorry) in Anglo mythology, but the monster who invades Conor\u2019s dreams\u2014whose insides are animated by terrifying, never-ebbing flames\u2014belongs to Conor alone. Speaking in intimidating intonations supplied by Liam Neeson, the monster informs Conor that he is going to appear to him to tell him three stories. And once the monster\u2019s stories are done, he will command of Conor the kid\u2019s own story, and an ultimate attendant truth that only Conor can articulate.  Advertisement This situation would seem challenging under the best of circumstances. Of course, the movie understands that the situation wouldn\u2019t arise at all under the best of circumstances. Conor\u2019s mother, a young woman herself, played by Felicity Jones, is direly ill, and has been for some time. She\u2019s a one-time artist who put aside her dreams once Conor was born. The boy\u2019s father, Toby Kebbell, has a whole other life in Los Angeles now. Conor\u2019s grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) is a stern intimidating figure who on the outset seems entirely disagreeable. We don\u2019t know it at first, but we suspect it: all the adults in Conor\u2019s family, however well-intentioned, are lying to him. His visits from his tree frenemy help him to reckon with that, albeit in an unconventional way.  When the monster calls, his tendrils wrap around the furniture in Conor\u2019s bedroom, and these tendrils themselves seem to grip the boy as the monster tells fables of kings and queens that end in frustrating paradox, confusing Conor. The boy and his beloved mom have moments of respite, enjoying a 16mm print of the 1933 \u201cKing Kong\u201d together, with Mom telling Conor it was a favorite of his late grandfather, who was the only person who could get Grandma to lighten up. These casually dropped bits of history become crucial as the film digs deeper and deeper into the realities of Conor\u2019s situation and the parables of the fantastic figure who helps him deal with that situation, despite Conor\u2019s furious opposition.  This is a very unusual picture, whether you\u2019re viewing as an adult or a teen, but it\u2019s not unprecedented. It has some genuine affinities with the underrated 1986 \u201cLabyrinth,\u201d in which Jennifer Connelly confronted a looming transition from girlhood to womanhood via a fantasy realm ruled by an elfin David Bowie. In that film, as in this one, a close examination of the characters\u2019 family photos yields useful clues as to what\u2019s \u201creally\u201d going on. But \u201cA Monster Calls\u201d is putting its young protagonist through a much tougher transition process, and as such the visions, and the challenges, are more wrenching and terrifying.  Advertisement While the giant tree monster\u2014in many scenes an actual animatronic creation, in the \u201cKong\u201d tradition\u2014is a formidable, fantastic effect, and the design and animation of his tales is first-rate, there are portions of the movie that are frenetically over-directed. Bayona\u2019s a formidable talent, and he\u2019s not out to discombobulate his audience in the manner of Michael Bay, but there are times when he\u2019s trying to do too much at once. The story also has some speed bumps. Too many movies nowadays depicting bullying among young people fall back on a very lazy audience-pleasing trick. That is, to have the victim get so mad he\u2019s just not going to take it anymore, and he gives the bully a good walloping. Never mind that this isn\u2019t how it works in real life, but the scene doesn\u2019t actually line up with the idea the tree monster wants to impart to Conor. That the buildup to the confrontation partakes in some peculiar possible gay-panic tension doesn\u2019t so much provide thematic enrichment as it does muddy the waters. (The aftermath of the incident does, however, give Bayona the opportunity to feature the great Geraldine Chaplin in a cameo role, so that\u2019s welcome.)  But once \u201cA Monster Calls\u201d settles in for its wrenching climax, and the revelation of Conor\u2019s \u201ctruth,\u201d it becomes both heart-squeezing and philosophically provocative. That the movie is beautiful to look at is a given, if you know Bayona\u2019s prior films, but sometimes it gets you in that department when you\u2019re least expecting it. A conversation between Conor and his grandmother during a rainy drive to the hospital, when the car is stopped for a passing train, is framed in beautiful autumnal running colors outside their car windows (the director of photography is \u00d3scar Faura, who has worked with Bayona on all his features); it\u2019s not only visually breathtaking but emotionally consonant and resonant. Despite its shortcomings, there are things about this film that are hard to shake; the movie\u2019s ultimate wisdom and overarching compassion make it very likely that you won\u2019t want to shake them, after all.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
