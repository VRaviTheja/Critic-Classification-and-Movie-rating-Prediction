{"Title": "Kill the Messenger", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The story of a crusading reporter\u2019s determined search for\r\ntruth, \u201cKill The Messenger\u201d gains its not-inconsiderable power by not being the\r\nkind of movie that particular description might lead you to expect. Or, for\r\nthat matter, not being the movie of that description that you might want. The\r\ngreat based-on-a-true-story journalism movie of the last 65 or so years was, of\r\ncourse, \u201cAll The President\u2019s Men,\u201d chronicling the determined search for truth\r\nconducted by crusading reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The\r\nWashington Post. One of the distinguishing features of \u201cKill The Messenger\u201d is\r\nthat The Washington Post figures in the narrative as one of the bad guys.  Advertisement Directed by Michael Cuesta (\u201cL.I.E.,\u201d \u201cRookie,\u201d and, most\r\npertinently, episodes of\u00a0 \u201cHomeland\u201d)\r\nfrom a script by Peter Landesman (the writer/director of \u201cParkland,\u201d who\r\nhimself has a considerable background in investigative journalism), and\r\nstarring Jeremy Renner, who is also an executive producer, \u201cMessenger\u201d is about\r\nGary Webb, a feisty reporter for the San Jose-Mercury News who seems to be\r\nhaving a grand old time writing about drug dealers who are getting their houses\r\nillegally confiscated by the government. His wife (Rosemarie De Witt) tolerates\r\nthe haphazard lifestyle such an occupation brings, up to a point; when the\r\nhotsie-totsie girlfriend of an accused trafficker drops off a package of files at\r\nWebb\u2019s home, the missus alludes to some past trouble in the marriage. Turns out\r\nthe hotsie-totsie (amusingly incarnated by Paz Vega) is kind of using Webb as a\r\ncat\u2019s paw, but in so doing, she throws either the story of a lifetime, or a\r\nlive grenade, or both, into his lap: information pointing to a government\r\ninvolvement in the crack cocaine trade, a byzantine arrangement by which the\r\nC.I.A. was able to fund Ronald Reagan\u2019s Contras by either looking the other way\r\nat, or deliberately engineering, drug-money-for-arms transactions. Interviewing\r\na big-shot dealer in a Central American jail (Andy Garcia), that dealer recalls\r\na meeting with one \u201cOllie.\u201d \u201cOliver North?\u201d Webb asks, a little stunned. \u201cNo,\r\nOliver Hardy, \u201c the prisoner says. \u201cOF COURSE Oliver North.\u201d  Despite the warnings of a D.C. bureaucrat (Michael Sheen)\r\nwho suggests that characterizing the realm Webb is exploring as a \u201crabbit hole\u201d\r\nwould perhaps be an extremely dire understatement, Webb convinces his editors\r\nto run his story. Initially hailed as a hero, Webb is soon met with\r\noverwhelming skepticism. Papers such as The New York Times and The Washington\r\nPost, with \u201cwho is this upstart?\u201d indignation, start picking at aspects of the\r\nstory, and then at Webb himself. The trouble to which Webb\u2019s wife had alluded\r\nto returns to bite him and his family in the ass, hard. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make\r\nit about you,\u201d Sheen\u2019s character predicted. Boy, do they ever. The movie is, in\r\nits details, relatively discreet about laying blame but fairly definite in\r\ndepicting a media culture now so entrenched in the establishment that it\r\ndoesn\u2019t even have to be coerced into serving the interests of the powerful.\r\nThat the filmmakers are able to pursue their theme to the extent that the true\r\nstory on which the film is based obliges them to somehow has to be credited to\r\nRenner. His performance is very good, despite the somewhat stereotypical bro\r\ncharacteristics with which the Webb character is here endowed. Around the\r\nmid-point of the movie, I noted that the material was sufficiently compelling\r\nthat, say, the montage of Renner tooling around on a motorcycle being all\r\nstressed out was kind of beside the point. In light of the picture\u2019s finale,\r\nthat sort of thing made slightly more sense, but still carried an aura of\r\nspecial pleading.  That said, it\u2019s a minor quibble relative to the pretty\r\nsubstantial points the movie\u2019s making. The death of print and the death of\r\njournalism are two different phenomena, but they\u2019re not unrelated; if you\u2019re\r\nof the opinion that it\u2019s all because of the Internet, well, \u201cKill The\r\nMessenger\u201d has some perhaps disturbing news for you\u2014about the news you are now\r\ngetting, and the news you are now not getting.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
