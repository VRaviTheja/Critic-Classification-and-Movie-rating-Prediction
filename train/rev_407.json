{"Title": "Late Phases", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "It\u2019s hard not to make a \u201cTwilight\u201d joke in a review of a\r\nfilm about a man in the later years of his life confronted with werewolves in\r\nsuburbia, but I\u2019ll try and avoid it. Adri\u00e1n Garc\u00eda Bogliano\u2019s \u201cLate Phases\u201d\r\ntells just such a story, sketching a horror-comedy about a grizzled Vietnam vet\r\nnamed Ambrose (Nick Damici), who moves to a community that seems to run into\r\ntrouble every 30 or so days with each full moon. Bogliano can\u2019t quite manage\r\nthe tones of the film, resulting in a frustrating piece of work overall, but\r\nDamici gives his memorable protagonist enough life to hold it together more\r\noften that it would have otherwise. He\u2019s great here. The movie around him, not\r\nso much. Advertisement Writing a horror film with a blind, elderly Vietnam vet as\r\nits protagonist is a risky proposition, but Damici rises to the challenge as\r\nAmbrose, a man we meet moving to a new community with his dog Shadow and the\r\nhelp of his son Will (Ethan Embry). As he\u2019s feeling the wall of his new abode,\r\nAmbrose pulls a massive claw from the wall. Something\u2019s not right behind these\r\npicket fences. The local older women initially take to Ambrose\u2019s rugged\r\npersona, but he soon rubs them the wrong way with his tendency to say what\u2019s on\r\nhis mind and brandish a loaded weapon. Ambrose doesn\u2019t make friends easily. And\r\nhe doesn\u2019t seem to care. He just wants to live out his final days with his dog\r\nand his peace and quiet. Of course, that\u2019s interrupted the first night he\u2019s there by\r\nan attack on the kind woman living next door. Ambrose hears the fight, in which\r\nwe see a man-sized wolf tear an old woman apart\u2014those turned off by gore might\r\nwant to stay away\u2014and he\u2019s quickly a part of the attack when Shadow gets\r\ninvolved, and ends up dead. One night in his new community, and Ambrose has to\r\nbury his only remaining companion. Naturally, he\u2019s pissed. And he\u2019s going to\r\nget to the bottom of the \u201canimal attacks\u201d in his new community. The cops don\u2019t\r\ncare. The suburban sprawl has extended near the forest and they\u2019re eager to\r\nwrite off the concerns of the older residents as animal attacks. Ambrose knows\r\nmore is going on, and tries to figure out who may be a creature of the night\r\nwhen the moon turns full. Could it be the kindly Priest (Tom Noonan)? Time to\r\nget some silver bullets, build a cross, and find out. The way that society discards its elderly, represented by\r\nEmbry\u2019s distant son and the dismissive authorities in this community, adds an\r\ninteresting subtext to Bogliano\u2019s film. And Ambrose\u2019s background does some of\r\nthe same, painting this battle with the supernatural as one last trip in the country for the veteran. He may be blind, he may be old, and he may have\r\nregrets, but this thing killed his dog and he\u2019s going to do what's right, goddammit. Damici finds just the\r\nright energy for the role, never overplaying Ambrose's potentially scenery-chewing traits. In fact, it\u2019s how\r\nseriously Damici plays the part that allows it to work. He never winks at the\r\ncamera as a lot of other actors would have. He takes Ambrose\u2019s\r\nplight seriously. Advertisement Sadly, I can\u2019t quite say the same about Bogliano. He never quite convinced me that he figured what kind of film he was trying to make. A lot of\r\nthe creature design is misguided (exaggerated and goofy more than scary), and some of the tonal jumps are jarring. The\r\nfilm goes from character-driven drama with Ambrose and his new religious\r\nexploration late in life to remarkably gory horror to something that plays\r\nmore like a horror-comedy with one-liners that would have worked in \u201cBubba\r\nHo-Tep.\u201d I think the various tones in Eric Stolze\u2019s script proved more of a\r\nchallenge than Bogliano expected. Balancing horror, comedy and drama in a way\r\nthat makes all three effective is incredibly difficult. All three typically end\r\nup getting less attention than they need.", "Critic": "Beta"}
