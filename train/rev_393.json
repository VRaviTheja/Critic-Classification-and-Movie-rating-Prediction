{"Title": "The Promise", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The Belfast-born writer and director Terry George is most at home in settings where there are troubles, and sorry about the unintentional play on words. With director Jim Sheridan he crafted two of the most searing and memorable films about his homeland and its tortured history, 1993\u2019s \u201cIn the Name of the Father\u201d and 1997\u2019s \u201cThe Boxer,\u201d both starring Daniel Day-Lewis. When he\u2019s been behind the camera himself, he hasn\u2019t chosen rom-coms: his 1998 HBO movie \u201cA Bright Shining Lie\u201d treated the Vietnam debacle from a particular military perspective, and 2004\u2019s \u201cHotel Rwanda\u201d took a focused look at one man\u2019s action against the Rwandan genocide. Even George\u2019s little-seen 2007 domestic tragedy \u201cReservation Road\u201d had a larger point about societal ills animating its core.  Advertisement With \u201cThe Promise,\u201d George, co-writing with Robin Swicord, treats the Armenian genocide of the early part of the 20th century, an action undertaken by the soon-to-be-displaced Ottoman Empire, as a side exercise in its alliance with Germany as World War I was about to break out. Well over a million souls were killed in this action, which the contemporary Turkish government still declines to acknowledge. Indeed, the recent movie \u201cThe Ottoman Lieutenant,\u201d set in the same period as this one, is produced in part by Turkish interests and has several scenes in which there\u2019s a pronounced \u201cwhatever Armenians WERE killed kind of had it coming\u201d vibe. And this film has been preemptively down-voted on IMDb by Armenian genocide deniers. One nice thing about George is that when he takes on a subject, he doesn\u2019t flinch or back down about the truths he needs to convey. But it\u2019s hard to deny that in some respects, \u201cThe Promise\u201d takes a long way to getting around to the meat of the story.  George and Swicord have chosen to focus the story around a love triangle. Young Mikael Boghosian, an apothecary from a village in Southern Turkey, betroths himself to a young woman from a family of means in order to go to Constantinople to attend medical school. At the house of the well-off relative with whom he\u2019s lodging, he meets the beautiful Anna, an artist who\u2019s also Armenian. Anna is married to Chris Myers, a committed American journalist who\u2019s also a hard-headed hard drinker. You see where this is going.  As Mikael, Oscar Isaac doesn\u2019t settle into his role right away, perhaps because for a while there isn\u2019t much of a role to settle into. He is the embodiment of goodness, of earnestness. Making a friend at the institute where he\u2019s enrolled, the fellow student asks \u201cSo you\u2019ve already studied medicine?\u201d and Mikael answers, \u201cYes, it\u2019s my passion,\u201d and all the ingenuousness Isaac can bring to bear on the character doesn\u2019t rescue the line. Once he admits his passion to Anna, he also reminds himself and her that he is indeed promised to another. Anna, in an excellent portrayal by Charlotte Le Bon, is the one who winds up pushing the issue. If Christian Bale\u2019s performance as Chris has the most vigor and intelligence, it\u2019s at least in part because the troubled character himself has those traits in the most abundance. Alliances are formed, trusts are broken, and then history intrudes; these three characters lose and find each other time and again as war destroys everything around them in each of the environments they travel to.  Advertisement For Mikael, that\u2019s initially a prison camp, where after a depiction of the depredations of hard labor, a dramatic incident involving \u201cweeping\u201d dynamite affords him his escape. He then returns to his village, where he does marry Maral, the young woman he\u2019d left behind; the couples\u2019 families hide them in a mountain cabin, and Mikael grows to love his bide. The theme of the good man who becomes a devoted husband while secretly loving another from afar is reminiscent of \u201cDoctor Zhivago.\u201d But while Anna and Myers take up resistance to the Armenian \u201cevacuations\u201d at a Protestant Mission, the Turkish exterminators are rampaging. The movie hits its cinematic stride, as it happens, when events are at their worst. \"The Promise\" is drenched in production value and replete with ravishing shots of sunrises and sunsets, but it\u2019s in the scenes of fleeing, of battle, and of horrendous loss that the film is at its most effective. The depiction of the savagery inflicted on Armenia is bracing. George is determined to make his story as much about the dead as about the fictional survivors. It\u2019s in that respect that \u201cThe Promise\u201d earns its unsettling honor.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
