{"Title": "The Other Side of Hope", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The Finnish director Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki films are often marked by a particular kind of humor. As I\u2019ve been saying since the early 1990s, he really can put the \u201cdead\u201d in \u201cdeadpan.\u201d This was particularly true in such \u201890s pictures as \u201cThe Match Factory Girl\u201d and \u201cI Hired A Contract Killer,\u201d tales of privation and depression that treated these subjects with both gravity and acknowledgement of an overall absurdity in the human condition. Mr. Kaurism\u00e4ki\u2019s protagonists are often drink-soaked sad sacks who achieve a kind of sodden resignation. In cases where they\u2019re not these types, they\u2019re the Leningrad Cowboys, an unlikely \u201crock\u201d \u201cband\u201d that carries on inexorably despite their ineptitude and the bemused semi-indifference of nearly every audience they encounter. Advertisement In recent years, though, the director has found something to believe in, and this has added a humanist dimension to his pictures that is both pleasing and moving. His 2011 \u201cLe Havre\u201d was about a shoe-shiner in the title French port who takes in a young African teen who came on a container ship. Aside from being an excellent illustration of the Christian proverb about loving thy neighbor, it was also a warm and funny film standing up for the larger principle of immigration. So too is his latest feature, \u201cThe Other Side of Hope.\u201d Because it\u2019s set in his native Finland, I suppose this picture has more of what I\u2019ll call Akian tropes than \u201cLe Havre\u201d did. One of its protagonists, Wikstr\u00f6m, drives around in a sleek, oversized black car of a vintage unknown to me, in keeping with the director\u2019s insistence of never depicting a post-1962 auto. Wikstr\u00f6m is a man at loose ends, having dissolved his marriage and subsequently won a small fortune at poker. He decides to invest that cash in a small bar/restaurant that\u2019s very down at its heels, and whose staff is highly ambivalent about the quality of attention that comes with a new owner. In the meantime, Khaled, a Syrian refugee who\u2019s come in via a coal ship (his emergence on docking is an unforgettable image) is being processed through Finland\u2019s supposedly humane immigration system. But once he\u2019s very politely rejected, he goes on the lam. Not selfishly\u2014he is merely desperate to get word from his sister in Syria while he is in Europe, and to arrange her passage out of Syria from the safety of Helsinki. Once Khaled and Wikstr\u00f6m\u2019s paths cross for the second time (their first encounter is when Wikstr\u00f6m almost runs him down in that aforementioned car), hope is revived, and comedy blossoms, as when Wikstr\u00f6m tries to transform his place into a sushi restaurant. But Khaled\u2019s quest is made difficult by belligerent racist skinheads. By the time Khaled is actually put in touch with his sister, the race against time is even more critical. The movie expands upon Kaurism\u00e4ki\u2019s central mode of observation and delivers some trenchant, upsetting truths about the immigration experience from the side of those seeking asylum. While in the detaining center awaiting a ruling on his case, Khaled is told by a friend not to appear too cheerful, as people will take him for mentally disturbed. Of course a serious mien may lead some to react with fear. As for the skinheads, they consistently get Khaled\u2019s ethnicity wrong as they spew hate at him. Kaurism\u00e4ki makes these bigots look ridiculous, but he also takes very seriously the damage they do, and the movie\u2019s finale takes that into account. Its suggestive title lingers at the end, leaving a question mark that the viewer will have to turn over personally, and that\u2019s a good thing.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
