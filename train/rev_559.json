{"Title": "The Second Mother", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "A fair to large number of the contemporary Brazilian films\r\nthat make their way to United States distribution deal with social inequities\r\non a large and harrowing scale. The frantic, violent 2002 \u201cCity of God\u201d is a\r\npertinent example, as are the hyper drug-busting \u201cElite Squad\u201d pictures.\r\nWriter/director Anna Muyleart examines class and income difference in a much,\r\nmuch quieter register in \u201cThe Second Mother,\u201d a domestic comedy-drama that\r\nstarts off from a fairly pat premise but builds strength over the course of its\r\ncareful, empathetic, and crafty unpeeling of its characters.  Advertisement Regina Cal\u00e9 plays Val, a spirited if frumpy middle-aged\r\nwoman who\u2019s worked for a well-off Sao Paolo family for over a decade. In that\r\ntime she\u2019s become practically a second mom to now-teen Fabinho (Michel\r\nJoelsas). She\u2019s practically a co-conspirator with the kid. After his parents,\r\nhaute-bohemians Barbara (the imperious bossy parent, played by Karine Teles)\r\nand Carlos (the laid-back failed artiste inheritor of a family fortune, played\r\nby Louren\u00e7o Mutarelli) upbraid Fabinho for having a stash of pot (they\u2019re avid\r\nsmokers themselves of course), Val assists him in retrieving it from the trash.\r\nIt\u2019s all cozy enough in its way, especially as Barbara and Carlos, the better\r\nto assuage their liberal guilt, make something of a show of treating Val as\r\n\u201cfamily.\u201d\n\r\nThis practice is put to the test when a figure from Val\u2019s past calls. Val, as\r\nit happens, left the Northern part of Brazil for Sao Paolo with something\r\nbehind her: a child of her own, J\u00e9ssica, whom she entrusted to relatives when\r\nshe went to work for something like a living. J\u00e9ssica (the great Camila\r\nM\u00e1rdila) is now a teen, and about to apply for university in Sao Paolo. She\u2019s\r\nseeing her mother for the first time in a long time, and the resourceful,\r\nsmart, appealing girl is put off right away by her mother\u2019s insistence that she\r\nmove into her employer\u2019s house with her. Given that J\u00e9ssica is attractive,\r\nresourceful, smart, and aspires to a form of independence, one can expect all\r\nmanner of sparks to fly. And they do.  The tensions between servant and master are evident before\r\nJ\u00e9ssica arrives, revealed in Barbara\u2019s barely-held in, snobbish reaction to a\r\ncoffee set Val presumes to give the family as a gift. Once J\u00e9ssica arrives, she\r\nat first knocks out her mom\u2014\u201cThe Internet...You can do that?\u201d Val exclaims on\r\nseeing her daughter\u2019s web savvy in action\u2014then confuses her with her dedicated\r\nstudying: \u201cThe whole day with a book, it\u2019s easy to go crazy.\u201d J\u00e9ssica\u2019s\r\ninsistence on taking the family at their word about her and her mom\u2019s equality\r\nin their eyes is a test of Barbara\u2019s already clearly-limited patience. At the\r\nsame time, Carlos sees in J\u00e9ssica a liveliness and adventurous spirit that\u2019s\r\nnow dead in him, and this leads him to make some extreme pronouncements that\r\nanimate some of the most awkwardly funny scenes in the film. As the movie goes\r\non, J\u00e9ssica gets increasingly fed up with her mother\u2019s willingness to be\r\npatronized and humiliated by her employers. As various pushes come to shove,\r\nJ\u00e9ssica\u2019s compelled to share a secret with her mom that brings them closer even\r\nas it illustrates what some might see as an unfortunate pattern. This isn\u2019t groundbreaking stuff, but it\u2019s consistently\r\nwell-observed and engaging. The cast is terrific, and Muyleart has an\r\nunderstated assurance in her handling of film language. The depiction of a door\r\nthat separates a large house\u2019s kitchen from its dining room is especially\r\nastute throughout. As are Muyleart\u2019s frequent uses of long, unbroken takes. By\r\nthe end of \u201cThe Second Mother,\u201d one feels enough at home with the characters to\r\nleave the theater with a healthy concern with where they\u2019re going to end up\r\nnext. This isn\u2019t the kind of film one associates with potential sequels, but I\r\nwouldn\u2019t mind seeing Muyleart follow up with Val and J\u00e9ssica some time Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
