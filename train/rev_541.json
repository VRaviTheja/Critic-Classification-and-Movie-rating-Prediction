{"Title": "Safelight", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "Bad movies are common. Shockingly bad movies, ones that are\r\nso incompetently conceived and executed as to force one to question how they\r\ngot made, are less so, despite what Angry Film Twitter might have you believe. \u201cSafelight\u201d\r\nis a jaw-droppingly bad movie, a film that doesn\u2019t have characters or a plot.\r\nIt has mouthpieces who speak in platitudes and clich\u00e9s, pushing forward through\r\na predictable, depressing narrative that sounds like a flunked high school\r\nstudent\u2019s attempt at creative fiction. To write off \u201cSafelight\u201d as just another\r\ngeneric romantic teen drama about wounded souls who find healing in each other\u2019s\r\narms wouldn\u2019t do justice to its baffling ineptitude.  Advertisement \u201cSafelight\u201d is about the shy, crippled boy and the hooker\r\nwith the heart of gold who change each other\u2019s lives. If you\u2019re asking\r\nyourself, \u201cDo they still make that movie?,\u201d \u201cSafelight\u201d is here with an answer.\r\nEvan Peters (\u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d) stars as Charles, a bullied 17-year-old\r\nwho works at a truck stop with a wisecracking Christine Lahti and, from the\r\nlooks of it, no actual truckers. Charles is drawn to the lone hooker who works\r\nthis lonely locale, Vicki (Juno Temple), an 18-year-old with a violent pimp\r\nnamed Skid (Kevin Alejandro). Apparently when they were handing out tough pimp\r\nnames, he was absent. Charles' mom left when he was a baby. Charles\u2019 dad is dying. Charles\u2019 brother is dead. Charles\r\nwants to take photographs of the California lighthouses, something his sibling\r\nwas going to do before he died. \u201cHe\r\nreally liked the idea of light guiding people home.\u201d Yes, \u201cSafelight\u201d is\r\none of those films in which every conversation and every action must play into\r\nthe arc of the healing-romantic-drama. Nothing registers as genuine. Peters and\r\nTemple have zero chemistry and writer/director Tony Aloupis doesn\u2019t even seem\r\ninterested in their romance, ignoring the sexual undercurrents that could have\r\nformed a coming-of-age story for Charles and even dismissing the idea that Vicki\r\ncould have found real love instead of the paying kind. He's too busy talking about lighthouses. Every opportunity for\r\nreal dramatic stakes in \u201cSafelight\u201d seems to have been considered and then\r\nignored. And as Charles and Vicki get closer, \u201cSafelight\u201d gets less and less\r\ngenuine. They\u2019re all caricatures, from the pimp who cackles like a maniac to\r\nthe dying father with the sage advice for his shy son. Caricatures are bad enough, but even the tropes are poorly\r\nexecuted here. The dialogue is forced, stilted and unnatural. At times, it\u2019s\r\nhard to believe performers like Temple and Peters, who generally make smart\r\ndecisions, could force this dialogue out of their mouths given the weird\r\nrhythms of the piece. Imagine reading greeting cards in a dramatic scene. It\r\nwouldn\u2019t sound right coming out of your mouth. The cadence of normal speaking\r\npatterns isn\u2019t even here.  Like the pictures that Charles takes of lighthouses, we\u2019ve\r\nseen \u201cSafelight\u201d before. And it was pretty boring then too. Charles actually\r\nsays about his photography and people in general, \u201cIf you look at it long enough, you get to see what it\u2019s really showing\r\nyou.\u201d \u201cSafelight\u201d illuminates nothing.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
