{"Title": "The Fate of the Furious", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Riding the success of \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d director F. Gary Gray jumps into one of the most successful franchises of all time with \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d the eighth\u00a0installment in a series that seems increasingly critic-proof. How big are these movies? They have made almost $4 billion worldwide, with the last one shattering the previous series record, bringing in $1.5 billion on its own. There are big franchises and then there\u2019s \u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d movies, which have found the perfect blend of international appeal, ridiculous action and, of course, an emphasis on \u201cfamily,\u201d whatever that word means to you. Regardless of reviews, this series is too big to fail. It\u2019s going to be around for a very long time. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be disappointed that \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d distinctly drops the level of quality in this series for the first time this decade. Advertisement With a series that has been this wide-ranging in terms of critical appeal, it feels like a declaration of taste is appropriate. I didn\u2019t care much about the films at all until \u201cFast Five\u201d although I agreed that \u201cThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\u201d took more risks and was more fun than the awful second (\"2 Fast 2 Furious\") and possibly-worst fourth film (\"Fast & Furious\"). It took five movies to figure out the franchise, turning them into roller coasters that alternated between cartoonish action set pieces and heartfelt conversations about makeshift families. They seemed like the answer to \u201cWhat if we made the entire movie like those insane opening bits from the Bond movies? Plus family.\u201d And the series only got better with the inclusion of new faces like Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Kurt Russell. Yes, they\u2019re ridiculous\u2014but that\u2019s also why they\u2019re fun.  So, why isn\u2019t \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d more fun? That\u2019s going to be the question to which you keep returning as you watch all 136 minutes of this film that\u2019s relatively enjoyable when compared to other hollow blockbusters but relatively disappointing when compared to the high points of this series. First and foremost, it\u2019s a movie that\u2019s over two hours long and has almost no plot. Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) betrays his team after being forced to work against them by a Bond-esque supervillain named Cipher (Charlize Theron). They work to stop him and get him back in their \u201cfamily.\u201d That\u2019s about it. Throughout, almost everyone gets one-and-a-half emotions. Michelle Rodriguez does the most she can with her blend of confusion and love for the man that may be trying to kill her now. Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson do a lot with their characters' rivalry, even it feels more like a Shane Black \u201880s action comedy than this series ever has before. Even the settings seem thin in terms of writing. The action jumps around the globe in a way that looks calculated for international appeal more than any real use of location. I picture a whiteboard in the writers room that says \u201cCuba=Hot, Russia=Cold.\u201d And while it\u2019s become something of a joke to say that these films are all about \u201cfamily,\u201d it really functions like a crutch here. They use the word over a dozen times, almost as if it\u2019s the fallback when they couldn\u2019t think of anything else plot-wise to link the action sequences. And here\u2019s where the defenders of the Furious Flame kick in with the chorus that plot doesn\u2019t matter to these films. It\u2019s all about adrenaline, and no one cares that the filmmakers forgot to give at least half the characters anything memorable to do this time around. And there are times when \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d bursts into escapist lunacy in which it\u2019s easy to agree. The \u201cbig\u201d sequences work, especially a bit with a wave of hacked self-driving cars in New York City and the climactic chaos in Russia that almost feels like it\u2019s mocking the \u201clongest runway in the world\u201d sequence from \u201cFast & Furious 6\u201d in terms of MPH inconsistency. When \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d gives viewers what they\u2019re really paying that ticket price to see, there\u2019s an undeniably goofy, playful, fun time to be had. It\u2019s all the other stuff that starts to really annoy. Advertisement This failing in the material that connects the action sequences is never more prominent than when Charlize Theron is on screen. \"The Fate of the Furious\" will go down as one of the largest wastes of a major talent in a blockbuster film in years. Likely cast because of how much ass she kicked in \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d writer Chris Morgan then neglects to give Theron a single notable action sequence. She\u2019s stuck on a high-tech plane, issuing orders to other people on the ground below. How on Earth do you bring in Imperator Furiosa and not make her race against Dom Toretto? She has one interesting sequence early in the movie, in which she and \u201cEvil Dom\u201d overtake the team, which makes the rest of her arc feel like even more of a disappointment because one sees what she could have done. There\u2019s no heat to this character whatsoever\u2014no physicality, no sexuality, no passion. We don\u2019t even really know why she\u2019s doing what she\u2019s doing, and you can actually see Theron start to get bored. This franchise has always had a villain problem\u2014although it\u2019s increasingly interesting that every villain eventually becomes a hero\u2014but this seems like the biggest misfire, not only in terms of wasted opportunity but how much time Theron is forced to deliver dull, useless exposition. It\u2019s tempting to blame the relative failures of this movie on the loss of the underrated Paul Walker or the new director. The action scenes are well-done, but the rest is surprisingly dull given what Gray has delivered in the past, leading one to believe he was purely for hire. The spectacle works. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve come to expect. I suspect it will continue to work for a few more films. But if they\u2019re going to rise to the entertainment level they\u2019ve hit before, this series needs someone behind the wheel who can make those narrative valleys between the peaks of the roller coaster ride more memorable. Find a writer who can write more interesting dialogue. Find a director who can add visual flair when cars aren\u2019t going boom. Give your increasingly gigantic supporting cast something to do. Of course, none of this will hold \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d back from box office glory. At this point, the destination is predetermined\u2014it's the journey to it that's getting exhausting.", "Critic": "Beta"}
