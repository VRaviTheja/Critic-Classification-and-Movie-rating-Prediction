{"Title": "La La Land", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Musicals made me a romantic. They taught me that some emotion is so powerful that it can\u2019t be put into mere words\u2014it must be sung. Some love is so overwhelming that you just have to move your feet. With a family that loved classic films, I remember being awed by Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, thinking they were as cool as anyone in movie history. Characters in musicals not only understood love differently than those in traditional films but they turned that understanding into art\u2014dancing, singing and transcending mere dialogue to become something greater, something purer, something closer to true romance.  Advertisement We\u2019ve had some musicals since the era of Rogers & Astaire, but few that have tried to recapture that sense of fluid, magical thinking in which characters communicate with their bodies as much, maybe even more, than they do with their voices. One of many remarkable things about Damien Chazelle\u2019s \u201cLa La Land\u201d is how much energy and time it devotes to movement and music, not just lyrics. The modern movie musicals, so often based on Broadway shows, have focused heavily on songs that further plot. In Chazelle\u2019s vision, choreography matters and a simple piano refrain can have more power than a lyric. This is a beautiful film about love and dreams, and how the two impact each other. Los Angeles is filled with dreamers, and sometimes it takes a partner to make your dream come true. \u201cLa La Land\u201d opens with a bit of a fake-out in that it\u2019s a large ensemble number of a variety that we won\u2019t really see again in the movie. Cars are stuck in the notoriously awful L.A. traffic when the drivers decide to break into song called \u201cAnother Day of Sun\u201d\u2014a bit about how each day brings new hope for these young wannabe artists\u2014jumping out of the cars and dancing on the freeway. Instantly, Chazelle\u2019s direction and the dance choreography feels different. Here, and throughout the film, he works in long, unbroken takes. You can not only see the dance moves, but you can see the dancer\u2019s entire body when he or she performs them. And after the chorus-like introduction to a city of dreamers, we meet two such sun-gazers: pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and actress Mia (Emma Stone). Like any good musical, the two have a few false starts and playfully mock each other\u2019s flaws in their first scenes. But we know where this is headed and Gosling & Stone have the chemistry to make us long for them to get together. The first major centerpiece scene is a long walk between Sebastian and Mia as the sun is setting over the Hollywood Hills. They start to see similarities in one another. Mia is tired of going on worthless auditions, ones in which the producer doesn\u2019t even look up from their phone. Sebastian holds on to an ideal version of jazz, wanting to open his own club instead of selling out and playing greatest hits for tourists. And Sebastian and Mia have a clear, instant attraction. So, even as they sing about how they\u2019re not really a couple, and how this gorgeous night is wasted because they\u2019re not with their true partners, their bodies tell another story with a fantastically choreographed dance number. Stone and Gosling aren\u2019t natural singers or dancers, but they bring so much character and commitment to every movement that it doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re fluid, engaged and mesmerizing. We watch them fall in love through dance. Advertisement Of course, it helps that Gosling and Stone have the kind of star power that made so many of those classic era musicals memorable. He\u2019s smooth and charismatic; she\u2019s clever and beautiful. The phrase has lost most of its meaning, but these are movie stars. And, of course, they\u2019re more than capable when \u201cLa La Land\u201d demands greater depth, finding characters so rich that the movie would work without the music. It\u2019s a story of artistic passion, and how easy it is to get derailed from your dream. Sometimes it takes another person to push you back on to the tracks to find it again. Gosling and Stone get these characters, finding grace in their movement but emotional depth in their arcs; Stone has never been better. \u201cLa La Land\u201d also exists as a very conscious ode to the allure of classic Hollywood. The pair goes to see \u201cRebel Without a Cause\u201d (ending in one of the most magical scenes in years) and films like \u201cCasablanca\u201d and \u201cBringing Up Baby\u201d are name-dropped. We have seen dozens of films that try to capture the allure of Hollywood, often with the cynical viewpoint that it will chew you up and spit you out, but Chazelle\u2019s vision feels unique. It pays homage to musicals like \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d and Jacques Demy's \u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\u201d without every directly mimicking them. \u00a0 It\u2019s easy to let the world get you down sometimes, especially in a year like this one. It\u2019s easy to think that dreams don\u2019t come true, and that love only exists in movies. \u201cLa La Land\u201d serves to remind us that movies can still be magical, and they can still provide the channel for us to see magic in the world around us. It\u2019s not so much another day in the sun, as the characters sing in that opening number, but the dreams of the night before, the ones we wake up and try to fulfill, that keep us dancing.
