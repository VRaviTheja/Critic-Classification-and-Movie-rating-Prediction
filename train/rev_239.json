{"Title": "68 Kill", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201c68 Kill,\u201d Trent Haaga\u2019s adaptation of Bryan Smith\u2019s novel of the same name, starts with a propulsive, grungy energy that works for about a half an hour. It\u2019s the story of a young man caught up in the allure of every beautiful woman he encounters, even if they\u2019re homicidal maniacs. It opens with a shot of a fly stuck in honey. Clearly, our male lead is the doomed bug, and the honey is, well, you get it. At its best, it recalls the \u201ccast of crooks, most of them morons\u201d aesthetic of writers like Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiaasen, and it often has the energy of the late-\u201890s crime movies that sprung up in the massive wake of \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d The film\u2019s biggest problem is that its greatest asset disappears for way too long and her absence allows one to notice the thin characters and lack of witty dialogue. This is the kind of piece that needs to move 100MPH from first scene to last for you to overlook its flaws. It slows down for too long to recommend the ride. Advertisement Matthew Gray Gubler is effective as Chip, the kind of na\u00efve, All-American kid who too easily trusts people and rarely considers the outcome of his actions. He literally shovels shit for a living as a sewer worker, and his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord) was a former stripper and hooker who\u2019s tired of having to bang her landlord when she can\u2019t pay rent. When she discovers that said landlord has $68,000 in a safe, she convinces Chip to help her steal it. Things go very wrong for Chip and Liza, and they\u2019re soon on the run with a witness named Violet (Alisha Boe) in the trunk. However, Liza has no qualms about doing what needs to be done with the pretty girl\u2014she\u2019s going to sell her to her brother, a man who tortures women for sexual pleasure. Yes, it\u2019s that kind of dark movie. Pitch black. And it\u2019s as if Chip is seeing the danger and moral depravity of the world for the first time. He\u2019s got to get away from Liza. Now. McCord is easily the best thing about \u201c68 Kill,\u201d finding the balance between a traditional femme fatale and something more akin to \u201cAmerican Psycho.\u201d She captures a woman who knows how to use her beauty to her advantage, but is sick and tired of having to do so. She\u2019ll take what she thinks she deserves however she can possibly can, whether it\u2019s sleeping someone like Chip or cutting someone\u2019s throat who crosses her. She\u2019s not so much a sociopath as someone who has simply stopped caring about the alleged order of a world that has given her nothing; so now she takes. McCord makes smarter decisions here than most other actresses would. The problem is that the movie sidelines her in ways I won\u2019t spoil, and we\u2019re stuck with Gubler and Boe, particularly grating as they get into a potential love subplot. The movie feels like a writing struggling to figure out where to take his characters in an extended midsection at a motel and then again in a dark final act in which Chip crosses paths with another crazy killer woman (Sheila Vand of \u201cA Girl Walks Home at Night\u201d). It\u2019s here when you notice that Haaga doesn\u2019t quite have the visual language as a director to make this as gritty and intense as it should have been\u2014the stakes don\u2019t feel real even as bodies are being mutilated\u2014and he doesn\u2019t have the ear for dialogue as a writer to make the characters feel like more than devices. \u201c68 Kill\u201d can\u2019t quite sustain its short running time, lacking enough character or plot to keep its cinematic engine moving, especially after it loses its turbo drive of a leading lady.
