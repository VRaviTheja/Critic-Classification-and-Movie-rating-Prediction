{"Title": "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Batman\r\nv Superman: Dawn of Justice\" is state of the art epic superhero\r\nfilmmaking. That's a compliment if you prefer these movies to be ponderous,\r\ndisorganized and glum, but a warning if you prefer tonal variation from film to\r\nfilm and scene to scene, and have a soft spot for storytelling that actually\r\ntells, you know, a story, as opposed to doing an occasionally inspired\r\nbut mostly just competent job of setting up the next chapter in a Marvel-styled\r\nfranchise. The\r\nstory begins with yet another flashback to young Bruce Wayne witnessing his\r\nparents' murder by a gun-wielding mugger, followed by a bracketing trauma, his\r\nencounter with a flock of bats in a cave near stately Wayne Manor. As co-written\r\nby Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer (\u201cBlade,\u201d \u201cDark City\u201d) and directed by Zack\r\nSnyder (\"Man of Steel,\" \"Sucker Punch,\" et al), this\r\nsequence initially plays like one more visit to a dried up well. But it makes sense when\r\nyou get to the next scene, a replay of the Metropolis-leveling \"Man of\r\nSteel\" showdown between Superman (Henry Cavill) and General Zod (Michael\r\nShannon) from the point-of-view of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck), who sees\r\nhundreds of members of his adopted professional \"family\" killed when\r\nWayne Industries' Metropolis office is damaged in the super-fight. (The\r\nsequence also portrays Wayne as a somewhat detached one-percenter who\u2019s ashamed\r\nat having taken his work \"family\" for granted\u2014a thoughtful touch.)  Advertisement This\r\nis the film's most affecting and original sequence, in large part because it\r\ntakes a persistent complaint against \"Man of Steel\"\u2014that the supposed\r\nBoy Scout from Krypton was callously oblivious to collateral damage\u2014and retrofits\r\nit, so that it looks like something \u201cMan of Steel\u201d always meant to do, the\r\nbetter to provide strong, simple motivation for Bruce. Re-traumatized by a 9/11-style\r\ndisaster that kills dozens of his employees, including a young girl\u2019s mother, he channels his anger\r\nand helplessness into a preemptive war against Superman, to be carried with biomechanical armor and Bat-tech fortified by Kryptonite. He sees Kal-El as a clueless and careless false god whose powers must be neutralized,\r\nlest humans get so comfortable with worshiping \"aliens\" that they set\r\nthe stage for a takeover by more Zods.  I keep referring to the cowled hero as Bruce because, more so than any\r\nBatman picture, \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d treats the Caped Crusader as a scary-awesome\r\nmanifestation of ordinary neuroses, practically a lycanthropic rodent-beast who emerges\r\nat night, summoned by his own monogrammed spotlight-moon. In comparison,\r\nSuperman seems a more balanced character: aside from the presence or absence of\r\nglasses or a cape and the stress of maintaining his cover story (he gets so\r\npreoccupied by an unauthorized investigation of Batman\u2019s vigilantism that he\r\nstarts screwing up his regular duties at the Planet), Clark Kent and Superman are essentially the same guy.  The title promises an even distribution of screen time. But despite the\r\npresences of touchstone DC characters\u2014including a smarmy, psychotic,\r\ntech-douche version of Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg, fidgeting and yammering\r\nlike Jeremy Davies); ageless Amazon warrior Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot); ace\r\nreporter and Superman gal pal Lois Lane (Amy Adams); Alfred the Butler (Jeremy\r\nIrons); Daily Planet editor Perry\r\nWhite (Laurence Fishburne) and Ma Kent (Diane Lane)\u2014this is ultimately an\r\noverstuffed, overpopulated, awkwardly plotted Batman picture that relegates the\r\nMan of Steel to a glorified supporting role. (If industry reports are to be believed,\r\nthis was a last minute decision by Warner Bros., which preferred the financial safe-bet\r\nBatman to the recently revitalized Supes.)  Advertisement Unfortunately, the script\u2019s early promise recedes as the movie unreels. \u201cBatman vs. Superman\u201d is a disorganized, lead-footed movie\r\nthat carries itself with unearned confidence; you see every card it\u2019s about to\r\nplay ten minutes before the movie plays it, yet Snyder doesn\u2019t just slap each\r\none down on the table with gusto, he keeps pointing to it and telling you what rank\r\nand suit it is. We surely would have surmised that the identical first names of Bruce\u2019s dead\r\nbiological mother and Kal-El\u2019s adoptive mother\u2014Martha\u2014would come into play\r\neventually, but the film is so worried that somebody might not get it\r\nthat it has Thomas Wayne croak \u201cMartha\u201d with his dying breath, then finds\r\nways to keep repeating \u201cMartha\u201d over the next two hours, building\r\ntoward a reprise-flashback of Bruce\u2019s parents\u2019 murder that will bring latecomers up to speed. There are other repetitious touches along these lines, including multiple,\r\nvocal assurances that the characters are fighting in depopulated areas\u2014a clumsy defensive strike against \u201cMan of Steel\u201d hand-wringing. It all seems pointless\r\nwhen you realize how little effort has been devoted to embellishing the characters\r\nin Snyder\u2019s \u201cNashville\u201d-sized cast, none of whom come alive as they did in Tim Burton\u2019s\r\nor Christopher Nolan\u2019s or even Joel Schumacher\u2019s Batman pictures. Eisenberg\u2019s\r\nLuthor might have been a fascinating third panel in the movie\u2019s gallery of lonely and haunted man-children (in a harrowing moment, he rails against \u201cdaddy\u2019s fist\r\nand abominations\u201d), but he mostly comes off as a 21st century\r\nbrogrammer, all tics and threats and unwanted physical advances. Adams\u2019 Lois\r\nLane is once again reduced to a poker-faced damsel in distress. Jeremy Irons\u2019\r\nAlfred isn\u2019t a patch on Michael Gough\u2019s or Michael Caine\u2019s. Gadot, a lithe\r\nbeauty with a musical accent and a steely demeanor, is granted less depth than a typical Bond girl. The movie shows little interest in explaining or\r\njustifying its knotted-up subplots, and its detours into franchise-building are\r\noften self-defeating. The most misguided is a dog-leg near the end: just when\r\nthe story starts building up a head of steam, it pauses for a recitation of the\r\nDC heroes we can expect to see in the first full-on Justice League movie.  \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d tries to compensate for these flaws and others through\r\nsheer scale and volume. It\u2019s two-and-a-half hours long, louder than an airstrip\r\nat O\u2019Hare, gins up \u201cexcitement\u201d with shaky-cam footage and hyperactive\r\ncutting, and has both figuratively and literally dark images. Even its daylight\r\nscenes seem to occur at dusk, thanks to the way Snyder and his cinematographer Larry\r\nFong bleed the color out and shroud the characters in smoke. Luthor\u2019s mutant Kryptonian monstrosity Doomsday\u2014spoiler warning not\r\nrequired; its presence was revealed in PR photos and promotional footage weeks\r\nago\u2014is a generic hell-beast, all ropy muscles, spiky\r\nencrustations, and Rancor-like teeth. Reports of a forthcoming \u201cR\u201d-rated\r\nDVD version aren\u2019t surprising: the movie\u2019s juicy stabbings, brandings-by-Batarang,\r\nclose-quarters gunshots, scenes of sadistic kidnapping and torment, and generally\r\ndespairing tone are Urban Thriller 101. The film is more effective when it\u2019s\r\nchanneling expressionist horror movies by filming action from disorienting angles\r\nand letting blood seep from strange nooks and crannies. When it borrows iconic designs\r\nand situations from its primary inspiration, Frank Miller's politically satirical, meticulously plotted graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns, it\u2019s like a kid stumbling around in dad\u2019s\r\nboots. Advertisement There are a few brilliantly realized moments, the acting is mostly strong despite\r\nthe weak script (Affleck and Cavill are both superb\u2014Affleck unexpectedly so),\r\nand there's enough mythic raw material sunk deep in every scene that you can\r\npiece together a classic in your mind if you're feeling charitable; but if you\r\naren't, \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d will seem like a missed opportunity. At times it might\r\nmake you long for Christopher Nolan's delicate touch. Those last four words\r\nhave never appeared side-by-side before. Life\u2019s funny that way.", "Critic": "Delta"}
