{"Title": "What Happened to Monday", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Tommy Wirkola moves on from Nazi zombies (he did both of the \u201cDead Snow\u201d movies) to identical sisters in the Netflix original film \u201cWhat Happened to Monday,\u201d a showcase for Noomi Rapace\u2019s range that will suffer in comparison to the similar \u201cOrphan Black,\u201d in which the amazing Tatiana Maslany plays identical clones. The Emmy-nominated actress gives a master class with that show, offering each of her characters their own identity, personality, flaws and strengths. Rapace doesn\u2019t have nearly the same material to work with but she does the best she can with this sci-fi curiosity, a movie that starts with a relatively clever concept but then doesn\u2019t build enough on its structure. On a narrative level, it\u2019s the kind of script that feels like it never got past the concept stage, almost defiantly refusing to build on its central premise with a world that seems three-dimensional or characters who feel like more than devices. Wirkola stages a few excellent set pieces and Rapace is fantastic, but the general lack of entertainment value has to be considered disappointing given the potential of the entire piece. Advertisement In a future not that dissimilar from the one imagined in \u201cChildren of Men,\u201d human beings have exhausted our planet\u2019s resources. It\u2019s resulted in a shocking but practical government decree: families can only have one child. If a family has more than one child, the extra child will be taken by the government and cryogenically frozen until a time when we have colonized another planet or found a way to create more natural resources. The woman in charge of this program, Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close), is the kind of ruthless leader who promises a better future while stripping families of their offspring.  When Terrence Settman (Willem Dafoe) has septuplet grandchildren, their mother dying in childbirth, he knows he\u2019s in serious trouble, but he crafts a masterful scam to keep his granddaughters alive. They will essentially take turns being Karen Settman, who eventually becomes a powerful businesswoman, but is really seven sisters working a very elaborate \u201cParent Trap.\u201d Named after days of the week, Monday, Tuesday, etc. must inform the entire sisterhood every night about every detail that happened during the day. And in one of the film\u2019s more ingeniously grotesque twists of fate, they must all look exactly the same. Think about the potential ramifications. If one sister loses a finger \u2026 And then Monday doesn\u2019t come home one night. The other six girls, who have distinct enough personalities to allow Rapace to have a little fun\u2014one is more of a bookworm than her sisters, one is more physically outgoing, etc.\u2014have to figure out what happened to Monday. It leads them into the clutches of the Child Allocation Board, and the truth about Nicollete Cayman\u2019s vision for the future. It\u2019s certainly not a bad idea for a sci-fi film, or an extended episode of \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d but screenwriters Max Botkin and Kerry Williamson needed another pass to take it beyond a very loose collection of action scenes. Most surprisingly given how \u201cDead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead\u201d played with expectations and got only increasingly more gonzo, \u201cWhat Happened to Monday\u201d is kind of boring when it comes to style. There\u2019s an awesome fight scene early on when the women are first tracked down by their enemies that features stunt work similar to Wirkola\u2019s other films, and allows Rapace to show off the physical abilities as an action star she\u2019s displayed before. But there\u2019s a shocking amount of sitting around and talking in this movie about seven sisters named after days of the week. It\u2019s almost as if the original script was more intellectual sci-fi, Wirkola pulled it as much as he could toward action, and it got stuck somewhere in the middle.  Advertisement \u201cWhat Happened to Monday\u201d is just not as fun as you\u2019d think it would be given the ridiculousness of its concept, the talent of its star, and even that one action scene. Part of the problem is the lack of a distinct villain\u2014Close hams it up in a few scenes but she\u2019s not memorable enough or given enough time\u2014which means Rapace has to flee a series of Men in Black with Guns, which just gets tiresome after a while. It\u2019s one of those Netflix films or shows that might get the job done on a boring Friday night, but that you won\u2019t remember by Monday. We\u2019re starting to see those with shocking regularity. Let\u2019s hope the pattern changes soon.", "Critic": "Beta"}
