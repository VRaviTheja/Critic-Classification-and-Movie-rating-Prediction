{"Title": "The Big Short", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The pre-release buzz is true: This is not your father\u2019s\r\nfinancial crisis movie. Nor, for that matter, is it \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d\r\nThe money masters of the universe depicted in this film\u2014and while their stories\r\nare interconnected, their lives are not, necessarily\u2014barely drink a sufficient\r\namount of red wine to get a good buzz on. Their buzz derives from an enhanced\r\nsense of smell. The closest to a \u201cWolf\u201d-like character here is Ryan Gosling\u2019s\r\nJared Vennett, the most standard-issue suit-and-tie banking bro of the bunch,\r\nand part of his schtick is to stand in a conference room sniffing\r\nostentatiously because, yes, he smells money.  Advertisement The money smelt, and earned, by the adventurers of this\r\nstory of the real-life 2008 world economic meltdown is arguably tainted by bad\r\nkarma. Based on a book by Michael Lewis, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d is about how several\r\ntraders and hedge fund managers made fortunes because they saw that the housing\r\nmarket\u2019s decline would cause a collapse of bonds contrived from sub-prime\r\nmortgages. The terminology is both dry and dizzying, the machinations\r\nincredibly convoluted. The main thesis of the story, adapted for the screen by\r\ndirector Adam McKay and his co-screenwriter Charles Randolph, is that as\r\nbanking became the top industry of the United States, bankers deliberately\r\nconcocted Byzantine financial tools whose main function was to help the rich\r\nget richer and screw over the little guy. You can expect a lot of pushback\r\nagainst this film of the \u201cwhere do these affluent Hollywood types get off\r\ncriticizing income inequality\u201d but that won\u2019t mean the movie is wrong.  And it really is quite a movie: entertaining and engaging,\r\nbut also mortifying; a good alternate title might be \u201cAmerican Horror Story.\u201d The film intertwines\r\nthree discrete storylines. The first focuses on Christian Bale\u2019s Michael Burry,\r\na trained physician with very stunted social skills whose genius at analysis\r\nand numbers-crunching found him running a very successful West Coast hedge\r\nfund. After finding some terrifying data within the structures of a large\r\nnumber of mortgage bonds, he concocts a radical idea: to \u201cshort,\u201d that is, bet against,\r\nthe housing bond market, which the banks have puffed up as being unassailable.\r\nTo do this he has to convince those banks to create a new financial tool, a\r\nkind of bond insurance policy. If Burry\u2019s right and the market collapses, he\r\nand his hedge fund make stupid money. But for as long as the market stays\r\nstable, Burry and his fund are obliged to pay stupid money in premiums.  McKay is best known as the director of such comedic fare as\r\n\u201cAnchorman,\u201d and, for all the silly self-reflexive humor in those films, there\u2019s\r\na sly underlying intelligence animating them, and here that takes the form of\r\ncelebrity cameos wherein attractive people such as Margot Robbie and Selena\r\nGomez directly address the audience with cogent and colorful explanations of\r\nterms such as \u201csub-prime.\u201d He also enlists \u201cAnchorman\u201d rep company member Steve\r\nCarell for one main role, as financial Prophet of Doom Mark Baum, whose own\r\nfund gets a whiff of what Gosling\u2019s character is smelling and takes a piece of\r\nthe action, in a partial fit of \u201cscrew the system\u201d indignation. Carell\u2019s\r\nself-torturing character is likely the closest thing this movie has to a\r\ndirectorial surrogate. Finn Wittrock and John Magaro play a couple of Jim\r\nHenson\u2019s Hedge Fund Babies, mentored by Brad Pitt\u2019s Ben Rickert. Rickert\u2019s\r\ncharacter can be read as something of a slight sendup of Pitt\u2019s own current\r\ndo-gooder persona; he\u2019s a former master trader who left the game out of\r\ndisgust, and who preaches a hippie-ish quasi-survivalist gospel to his two\r\nyoung acolytes even as he helps them get pretty much super-rich. Advertisement I started off feeling skeptical about this movie: the\r\nhairstyles and clothes of the main characters were more \u201890s music-video than\r\nearly 2000s, and the sometimes-color-desaturated flashbacks to some characters\u2019\r\nback stories were a little on the drearily commonplace side. But the narrative\r\nmomentum, combined with the profane wit of much of the dialogue, and the\r\ncommitted acting going on beneath the hairpieces, all did their job. And they\r\ngot across the angry, pessimistic conviction behind the movie, which is that\r\nthe major banks all engaged in fraudulent, criminal activity, and that the U.S.\r\ngovernment bailed them out at the expense of the little guy, and that there\u2019s\r\nno indication that the banks aren\u2019t going to do something like the exact same\r\nthing all over again. You are free to disagree. But this is a movie that uses\r\nboth cinema art and irrefutable facts to make its case. It\u2019s strong stuff.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
