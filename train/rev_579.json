{"Title": "Kill Me Three Times", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "In the bizarre, not to say entirely improbable, not to say\r\npointlessly ridiculous, not to say\u2014well, you get the idea, world of \u201cKill Me\r\nThree Times,\u201d ostensibly ordinary people in Western Australia have perfect\r\nteeth and perfect hair and generally very fit to middlingly fit bodies. And all\r\nthese very well-maintained ordinary people seem to spend all their leisure time,\r\nof which there\u2019s apparently quite a lot, attempting varieties of criminal\r\nactivity. Seems kind of counterproductive given the abundance of natural beauty\r\nin the location but what are you going to do? There\u2019s a bar/hotel owner sitting\r\non a pile of apparently ill-gotten cash, a milquetoast dentist with a gambling\r\nproblem and his hotsy-totsy wife who\u2019s got him embroiled in a\r\nmurder-and-insurance fraud scheme, there\u2019s a wayward wife looking to rip off\r\nher suddenly cash-rich husband and leave town with the hunky local auto\r\nmechanic with a quick temper, and there\u2019s a crooked cop extorting money from a\r\nbunch of the aforementioned. And then there\u2019s the smart-ass know-it-all\r\nsurveillance-specialist-cum-hitman who speaks the first word of the movie,\r\nwhich is, in case you couldn\u2019t guess, a four-letter one.  Advertisement The story mechanics of \u201cKill Me Three Times,\u201d and\r\n\u201cmechanics\u201d really is the right word, are revealed, as the title suggests, in\r\nthree discrete episodes, each one telling the same tale from a different\r\nperspective and/or time frame. In the event this is starting to sound familiar,\r\nthe film\u2019s score, by Johnny Klimek, is pretty heavily reliant on surf guitar,\r\nor at least a simulation of surf guitar. So, yes, improbably enough in the year\r\nof our Lord 2015, Australian filmmaking (once upon a time replete with original\r\nand powerful voices, more\u2019s the pity) is offering up a slab of gigglingy\r\nsadistic sub-early-Tarantino hogwash. And populating it, dispiritingly enough,\r\nwith relatively appealing acting talent: Simon Pegg plays the hitman Wolfe,\r\nAlice Braga a wayward wife; the rest of the cast is actually Australian, and\r\nincludes Sullivan Stapleton of \u201cAnimal Kingdom,\u201d Teresa Palmer, here continuing\r\na run of lousy casting luck that also includes \u201cI Am Number Four\u201d and \u201cWarm\r\nBodies,\u201d and stalwart Bryan Brown, relaxed and smirky in the small role of the\r\ncrooked cop. As it saunters to the not-inordinately tricksy steps laid\r\nout in James McFarland\u2019s screenplay, Kriv Stenders\u2019 direction also luxuriates\r\nin competent cinematic sheen: helicopter shots over pristine blue water,\r\napproaching a beautiful glass and sandstone beach house; perfectly rectangular\r\nneon-colored lens flares in night-at-the-bar scenes; nicely framed\r\nshiny-brick-lined corridors awash in deep blue light. There are also some\r\nsnazzy automobiles, including a mint condition fire-engine red VW bug. Because,\r\nyou know, why not\u2014they like their unusual cars in their contemporary neo-noirs,\r\ndon\u2019t they. The requisite spurting gunshot wounds to the neck are also here;\r\nwhat isn\u2019t here is engaging dialogue (\u201cTourist?\u201d the auto mechanic character\r\nasks Wolfe; \u201c Sort of,\u201d Wolfe replies\u2026or something like \u201csort of,\u201d to be honest\r\nit\u2019s hard to recall, and I didn\u2019t write it in my notes\u2026) engaging characters,\r\nor any kind of convincing reason-for-being with respect to the whole\r\nenterprise. One is apt to mourn the time wasted not just by the movie\u2019s living\r\nparticipants, but also by the VW bug. All participants could have gotten up to\r\nsomething far more enjoyable.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
