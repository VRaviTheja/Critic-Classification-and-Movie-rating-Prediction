{"Title": "The Night Of", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d starting Sunday and airing over the\r\nnext eight weeks, unfolds like the great novels of one of its creators, Richard\r\nPrice. The author of \u201cClockers\u201d and \u201cSamaritan\u201d (among many others, but those\r\nare definite must-reads) has an amazing ability to tell stories of crime that\r\naren\u2019t mere whodunits but survey and analyze the cultural and urban landscape\r\nas their mystery unfolds. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d contains universal truths but also\r\ncouldn\u2019t take place anywhere other than where it does and when it does, in a\r\npost-9/11 New York City. It approaches one crime from several\r\ndifferent angles without ever losing the narrative or feeling unfocused. Each\r\nepisode feels like it introduces us to a new major player just as essential as\r\nthe one before, from the murder suspect himself to an attorney who lucks upon the case of\r\nhis life to the retiring cop investigating one last criminal act and so on and so on. It\r\nis about the immigrant experience in NYC, the cruelty of the criminal-creating\r\nestablishment known as Rikers Island, a legal system in which guilt and\r\ninnocence are often afterthoughts, and, ultimately, a fascinating mystery. It\r\nis Agatha Christie meets \u201cThe Wire,\u201d and it\u2019s one of the best things on TV in\r\nan already-great year. Advertisement The opening hour-plus of \u201cThe Night Of\u201d spends almost all of\r\nits time with Nasir \u201cNaz\u201d Khan (Riz Ahmed from \u201cNightcrawler,\u201d and also\r\nappearing in the upcoming \u201cJason Bourne\u201d and \u201cStar Wars: Rogue One\u201d in an\r\neffort to have the most breakthrough 2016 possible), a Pakistani-American\r\ncollege student living in Queens. He seems like a nice kid, the kind stunned to\r\nbe invited to a cool party in Manhattan on an October night. When his friend, who is also his ride,\r\nbails on him, Naz \u201cborrows\u201d his father\u2019s taxi to go into the city. As he\u2019s\r\ntrying to find the party, a beautiful young woman gets into his cab. She wants\r\nto go to the beach. She's pretty enough and mysterious enough that Naz plays along. By the end of the night, he\u2019ll be arrested\r\nfor murder.  This first hour, shot by the legendary Robert Elswit (\u201cThere\r\nWill Be Blood,\u201d \u201cInherent Vice\u201d) and directed by Steven Zaillian (all but one\r\nhour were helmed by the director of \u201cSearching For Bobby Fischer,\u201d and that one\r\nwas directed by \u201cMan on Wire\u201d\u2019s James Marsh), hums like the best procedurals.\r\nModern, educated TV audiences know something is going to happen to Naz\u2014there\u2019s\r\nno show otherwise\u2014but the premiere takes its time with details that you won\u2019t\r\neven know matter until episodes later when the show is in trial. Every\r\nencounter, every decision, every moment feels both naturally captured\u2014thanks in\r\nlarge part to Ahmed\u2019s spectacularly lived-in performance, which only gets better in subsequent episodes\u2014and also part of a\r\ncomplex piece of art. In that sense, \u201cThe Night Of\u201d reminds one of Lumet\u2019s '70s and \u201880s\r\nfilms in that character is never lost in the \u201cbigger picture\u201d of mystery or\r\ncommentary. Lumet had an incredible ability to tell NY stories that were both sprawling and intimate. \"The Night Of\" shares that duality. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the arguable protagonist of the\r\npiece, attorney John Stone (John Turturro) has echoes of Paul Newman\u2019s Frank Galvin from \u201cThe Verdict.\u201d He carries around business cards with his smiling face\r\nand just happens on Naz in the precinct holding cell on the fateful night in question. Does he see innocence\r\nin Naz\u2019s eyes? Or does he just see opportunity? Exactly what each of the key characters in \u201cThe Night Of\u201d are getting out of the situation, especially major\r\nplayers like Detective Box (the great Bill Camp) and a young attorney named Chandra\r\n(Amara Karan), becomes essential to the way it unfolds. And when Naz gets to\r\nRikers, where young men are held until trial and either hardened further or\r\npossibly even killed, he meets a career criminal (the mesmerizing Michael K. Williams) who\r\nsees him as an opportunity. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d exemplifies the ripple effect of not just crime but the mechanics of a\r\ncriminal investigation, from the men whose path crosses with Naz\u2019s at Rikers to\r\nhis family (including the great Asghar Farhadi regular Peyman Maadi as Naz\u2019s father),\r\nunable to cover his defense.  Advertisement On top of all these great ensemble performances and\r\nmemorable characters, there\u2019s a riveting procedural element to \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d\r\nespecially in the early episodes, in which Zaillian and Price display an\r\nobvious fascination and respect for relatively unwanted jobs being done\u2014from the\r\ngraveyard shift at the police station to the morgue attendants and so on. It\u2019s\r\nthe kind of show where you distinctly hear the squeak of a dry erase marker as it writes \u201cHomicide\u201d\r\non the white board. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d doesn\u2019t cut corners, giving Price fans the\r\ndetails they expect but that we rarely see in episodic television. And yet the\r\nbalance between detail and character is never thrown off. In one sense, it\u2019s a\r\nprocedural with a protagonist uninterested in procedure or facts (Stone makes\r\nclear that he doesn\u2019t care if Naz did it or not\u2014actual guilt or innocence is\r\nonly one issue in the criminal justice system). It unfolds confidently as a\r\ngreat crime novel AND as a character study of two men who would never meet if not for a murder, likely because of Price\u2019s ability\r\nwith the detailed mechanics of the crime novel mixed with Zaillian\u2019s very human touch with actors. Let\u2019s hope\r\nthey work together again soon. (Note: They only made seven of eight episodes available for press so if it all goes off the rails in the final\r\nhour, remember the star rating is based on what I\u2019ve seen. I have faith, though.)", "Critic": "Beta"}
