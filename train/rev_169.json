{"Title": "Literally, Right Before Aaron", "Stars": 0.0, "Review": "Justin Long plays a fellow named Adam in \u201cLiterally, Right Before Aaron,\u201d a movie whose title allusion is explained about 30 minutes in. Aaron is the man marrying Adam\u2019s lovely ex-girlfriend Allison, played by Cobie Smulders, and Adam dated her literally right before. This is something of an issue for Adam. The movie opens with Adam getting the invitation to the wedding, by phone. Right away we can tell his relationship with Allison was special, because he has brief flashbacks of her face, and the shots all have lens flares in them, and they all look like low-rent ripoffs of similar frames from the Spike Jonze movie \u201cHer,\u201d specifically the parts where Joaquin Phoenix is getting all moony remembering Rooney Mara. So the wedding invite sets him askew. He goes out with work pals Mark (John Cho) and Claire (Charlyne Yi)\u2014did I mention that Adam works in the movie business, or its periphery, editing a nature show for a pompous fake zoologist played by Peter Gallagher?\u2014and he mopes throughout. \u201cDude. Just bowl. You\u2019re being a douche,\u201d Charlotte tells him. And honestly, writer/director/editor/composer Ryan Eggold, best known for acting on the television show \u201cThe Blacklist,\u201d could have ended the movie right there, because what we\u2019ve got for the next 30\u00a0minutes is, well, Adam being a douche.    Advertisement Adam then proposes impulsively to a glossy high-profile girlfriend, whose particular glossiness definitively tags her as Not The One. As she\u2019s about to accept, he blurts, \u201cI think we should break up.\u201d She exclaims, with absolute justification, \u201cYou are an a**hole. An A**HOLE.\u201d Storming out of the restaurant, she adds, \u201cYou are going to die alone.\u201d Again, this would have made a good ending to the movie. But no. Instead we get an hour-and-a-half of Adam brooding and reminiscing on his shared past with Allison, including their ostensible \u201cmeet-cute.\u201d This is really good. He approaches her in the college library while she\u2019s sitting among the stacks reading Of Mice and Men. He says to her, \u201cDo you want to get a coffee, or a juice, or a soda ...\u00a0\u201d She replies, \u201cI\u2019m reading my book.\u201d    And he tells her the book\u2019s ending. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re charming or just an a**hole,\u201d she says. I don\u2019t know about you, lady, but I had a pretty good idea during the bowling scene.    Of course, maybe Allison isn\u2019t so delightful either. There\u2019s one restaurant scene flashback that\u2019s meant to evoke \u201cAnnie Hall.\u201d Now, only the intent is evident; the evocation itself doesn\u2019t really take. The couple is trying to out-gross-out each other by concocting imaginary crimes against their fellow restaurant patrons. The scenario Allison proposes ends, \u201cand he dies \u2026 alone \u2026 of AIDS.\u201d Cute.\u00a0    Back in the present tense, Adam heads to San Francisco to attend the wedding. He accepts an invitation from groom Aaron to play tennis, even though he is incapable of playing tennis. He gets drunk at the wedding and dances like a jerk; he tells a nine-year-old boy to \u201ccall me when you\u2019ve got some hair on your balls\u201d; he does some indirect looks-shaming of a character played by Kristen Schaal, and much, much more.    It\u2019s painful to watch. Not because no one cares about Adam\u2019s heartache. But because the movie is boring, trite, sexist tripe that wants to make the viewer empathize with a guy who\u2019s actually pretty aggressive in his pursuit of loserdom. The only achievement Adam seems to have ever racked up in life was in dating Allison, who looks like Cobie Smulders and makes AIDS jokes. And Adam managed to screw that up, and I should care \u2026 why? Because Justin Long has a pleasant face? IT\u2019S NOT PLEASANT ENOUGH. Near the end of the movie, Adam defends himself. \u201cAmbush? This isn\u2019t an ambush,\u201d he says to Allison after accosting her in the ladies room at the wedding. Saying this, he\u2019s poking his finger at her in a way that comes close to actual assault. If one of those digits actually lands on her clavicle, it\u2019s going to leave a bruise.\u00a0 Advertisement There\u2019s a phrase circulating in contemporary cultural discourse: \u201cmediocre white men.\u201d As a white man who grapples a lot with insecurity and other roiling ups and downs of self-worth even at an advanced age, it\u2019s a group of words that sometimes makes me tetchy. Having watched \u201cLiterally, Right Before Aaron,\u201d though, I have a new understanding and appreciation for the term. More\u00a0importantly, I better understand the people who can\u2019t get their films made while self-pitying, mediocre fare centered on mediocre white men seems to come off something resembling a low-budget assembly line.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
