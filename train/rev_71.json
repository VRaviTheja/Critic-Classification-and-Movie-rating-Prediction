{"Title": "We Are Your Friends", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Electronic Dance Music, or EDM as Those Damn Kids call it,\r\nis quite the thing with the aforementioned Damn Kids these days, with their\r\nrave and their Molly and whatever the hell else they\u2019re up to. Its synthetic\r\ntrappings notwithstanding\u2014the \u201cElectronic\u201d part\u2014EDM is dance music, just like\r\nBig Band Swing was, just like early rock and roll was, just like disco was. All\r\nmusics that were initially reviled, and to some extent (with the arguable\r\nexception of Big Band Swing) initially misunderstood by Hollywood.  Advertisement \u201cWe Are Your Friends,\u201d directed by Max Joseph, from a script\r\nby Joseph and Meaghan Oppenheimer (based on a story by producer Richard\r\nSilverman), makes a big deal out of \u201cgetting\u201d EDM. There\u2019s the sleek,\r\nvisual-format flexible manner of the filmmaking, which mixes graphic design\r\ntropes with animation and such for some of the movie\u2019s most engaging sequences.\r\nThere\u2019s a scene in which the protagonist, a fledgling EDM DJ named Cole Carter,\r\nexplains the science of EDM as he rocks a dance floor, elaborating on getting\r\nthe magic BPM (Beats Per Minute) count that makes the music control the dance\r\nfloor subjects, almost zombie-like in the grip of the pulsating bass. There\u2019s a\r\nlittle music-wonk name dropping, with a mentor DJ showing off a rare Buchla\r\nsynthesizer and comparing his possible prot\u00e9g\u00e9, unfavorably, to one Juan\r\nAtkins.  Joseph recently made a documentary about the EDM production\r\nteam/record label DFA, so he\u2019s got some genuine knowledge under his belt. And\r\nwhile EDM is an area of music in which my expertise doesn\u2019t extend far past\r\nthat of an interested dabbler/dilettante, the EDM soundtrack of this movie\r\nsounded pretty credible/hot to me. Too bad that the movie\u2019s character dynamics\r\nand plot are as cheesy as that of, oh, I dunno, \u201cDon\u2019t Knock The Rock.\u201d How\u2019s\r\nthis for clich\u00e9: talented, eager, but unseasoned DJ gets taken under the wing\r\nof older, popular, but jaded and close-to-washed-up genre star, who shows him\r\nthe ropes, opens his ears, and who also happens to\u2026wait for it\u2026have a gorgeous\r\ngirlfriend with whom Mr. Talented And Eager gets entangled in a bad way. Yeah,\r\nthat kind of plot.  What\u2019s worse is that said DJ, Cole Carter, comes complete\r\nwith a contingent of San Fernando Valley tatted BroDouche pals, kind of out of\r\nthe \u201cDiner\u201d handbook but even more belligerent, clueless, and sexist. And minus\r\nany charm. There\u2019s super-brash Mason (Jonny Weston), self-proclaimed \u201cmovie\r\nstar\u201d Ollie (Shiloh Fernandez), and Squirrel (Alex Shaffer). In the event you\r\nhaven\u2019t guessed, Squirrel is the shy, sensitive one.  As for Cole, he\u2019s played by Zac Efron, getting a tad edgier\r\nafter \u201cNeighbors.\u201d I had, a few months ago, come upon a bit of misinformation:\r\nI read somewhere that Zach Braff was playing the role of the EDM DJ in this\r\nmovie. I had a great observation prepared, something along the lines of,\u00a0 \u201cZach Braff trying to pass himself off as a\r\nguy who\u2019s even HEARD any EDM, let alone an EDM DJ, is about as plausible as\r\nBruce Hornsby jamming with The Melvins.\u201d But, as I said, I was misinformed.  Advertisement Efron, however, often looks nearly at sea as Braff would\r\nhave. Part of it has to do with his character being a bit of a cipher to begin\r\nwith. His mentor-girlfriend triangle, while entirely rote and predictable in\r\nmost of its particulars, also constitutes one of the more watchable overall\r\nportions of the movie (the stuff with Cole and his pals is very nearly\r\ninsufferable, and the detour these career-challenged millennials take with a\r\ncoarse real estate vulture in a subplot constitutes several varieties of\r\nnadir), because the mentor DJ is played by Wes Bentley, who brings a humming\r\nundercurrent of sardonicism to his role, and the assistant/girlfriend is played\r\nby Emily Ratajkowski who is just\u2026delightful to look upon. A scene at a Vegas DJ\r\nfest wherein her character gives Cole a tab of Ecstasy, or whatever it is, and\r\nthey \u201croll\u201d together made me wish I was a much younger man, a man with hair,\r\nand a tolerance for recreational drugs. I should say ALMOST made me wish, as I\r\nhappen to be happily married to a beautiful woman who doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m\r\nbald. I should also mention that aside from having Major Presence, Ratajkowski\r\nnavigates her character\u2019s three crucial (actually only) nodes, Sweet, Sexy, and\r\nSensible, very well.  But I digress. Lest the viewer come to the conclusion that\r\nthis movie\u2019s portrayal of the EDM drug culture is too cavalier, there does kick\r\nin near the end a Cautionary Tale Plot Point, which is arbitrary to the point\r\nof insulting. Except it\u2019s too late to be really insulted, because one is\r\nalready painfully aware of how unsuccessful the movie has been. And then, when\r\nthe movie makes one more flashy attempt to get lay viewers to \u201cgrok\u201d EDM, it\u2019s\r\ntoo late, despite the sequence being kind of not bad. While I might actually go\r\nout and buy the soundtrack album, the last thing I\u2019m gonna say about the movie\r\nis friends shouldn\u2019t let friends pay money to see \u201cWe Are Your Friends.\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}
