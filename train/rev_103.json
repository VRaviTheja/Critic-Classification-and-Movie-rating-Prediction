{"Title": "Goodbye to All That", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The southern-based playwright and screenwriter Angus Maclachlan makes his film\u00a0directorial debut with this disarming sex comedy about a fellow named Otto whose\u00a0hapless inattention to certain salient details of his existence leads to the breakup of his\u00a0marriage. Otto, played with sly charm and vulnerability by Paul Schneider, is so in the\u00a0moment that he tends to discount how a given moment might do some damage, as when\u00a0he crushes his foot tooling around in a dune buggy with his nine-year-old daughter.\u00a0Later on, that daughter, Edie (Audrey P. Scott, who\u2019s wonderful), tells her mom Annie\u00a0(Melanie Lynskey), how she\u2019s been praying for her dad, because she \u201cwants God to be\u00a0nice to him.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement Annie doesn\u2019t feel like being super-nice to him; soon, with the help of a very take-charge\u00a0therapist, Annie informs Otto that \u201cthe marriage is over\u201d and Otto is soon out on his own.\u00a0Upon learning of the affair that prompted Annie\u2019s action, Otto returns to the dating pool\u00a0and is both bemused and frustrated to learn that love interests both old and new, played\u00a0by an array of attractive actresses that go from Heather Graham to Anna Camp to Ashley\u00a0Hinshaw to Heather Lawless, are largely interested in falling into bed with him and not\u00a0much else.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of good awkward fun to be had as the viewer simultaneously laughs\u00a0at Otto\u2019s expense and hopefully commiserates a bit with him. Particularly hilarious\u00a0and cringeworthy is a scene of a nude sit between Otto and young, lissome Mildred\u00a0(Hinshaw), who\u2019s very into chat prior to sexual activity. \u201cI like that you have calluses on\u00a0the palms of your hands,\u201d Mildred coos to Otto, and the look on Schneider\u2019s face as he\u00a0regards his distinctly un-callused palms (the guy works as a web designer, for heaven\u2019s\u00a0sake) is priceless. The movie is replete with little eccentric touches of behavior, dialogue\u00a0and performance. It\u2019s in a totally different register than the two prior Maclachlan\u00a0pictures I\u2019ve seen, the affectionate and quirky Southern family drama \u201cJunebug\u201d (2005,\u00a0directed by Phil Morrison) and the intense spiritual allegory \u201cStone\u201d (2010, directed\u00a0by John Curran). There\u2019s almost a sense of male wish-fulfillment in the parade of truly\u00a0luminous women who come into Otto\u2019s life, but this makes the humor of their subsequent\u00a0eccentricities that much more potent, as in Camp\u2019s sexual super-freak who, after an\u00a0intense bout with both Otto and a sex toy quietly avers \u201cI wanna read my Bible.\u201d\u00a0 Otto\u00a0and Maclachlan seem to embody the same attitude towards women: affection and nearly\u00a0awe-filled respect combined with a certain amused exasperation. It\u2019s slightly ironic that\u00a0by then end of this concise film\u2019s story arc, the most ostensibly sane of Otto\u2019s romances\u00a0makes him the most outlandish proposition, to which Otto replies: \u201cCan I?\u201d Whether he\u00a0can and whether he does is addressed in the movie\u2019s coda, and movie lovers looking for\u00a0an unusual, quirky, regionally sensitive (autumn in North Carolina has never looked more\u00a0appealing in a film) will enjoy taking the brisk, entertaining journey to the place of Otto\u2019s\u00a0resolution.
