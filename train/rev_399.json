{"Title": "Meadowland", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cMeadowland\u201d hinges on an inciting incident so horrifying\r\nthat it\u2019s really unfathomable to imagine, even for those of us who have\r\nchildren. Conveying a grief that most people will never have to endure can be a\r\ndifficult task for a filmmaker, and they often fall back on over-telling such\r\nstories, making sure every line of dialogue and every shot selection drips with\r\npain. Such is the case with Reed Morano\u2019s directorial debut \u201cMeadowland,\u201d a film with two very\r\nstrong central performances from a pair of underrated actors that falters by being so self-aware of the tortured existence it\u2019s\r\nattempting to capture. In the end, it feels like Morano didn\u2019t trust her actors\r\nquite enough to be the conduits of emotion, falling back on too many filmmaking\r\nand screenwriting tropes that hamper the realism of their work. Advertisement Sarah (Olivia Wilde) and Phil (Luke Wilson) pull over at a\r\ngas station in the opening scene of \u201cMeadowland.\u201d Their son goes into the\r\nbathroom and doesn\u2019t come out. There was a door in the back of the restroom\r\nleading to the garage, the street, and the rest of the world, and he\u2019s gone\r\nwithout a trace. As a father of three, even writing that sentence sends chills\r\nup my spine. I can\u2019t imagine the pain. And \u201cMeadowland\u201d wastes no time jumping\r\ninto that bottomless well. This will be a movie about grief. This will be a\r\nmovie about suffering. \u201cMeadowland\u201d jumps forward a year to reveal Sarah and Phil\r\nquietly imploding over the disappearance. They try to go about relatively\r\nnormal lives\u2014Sarah is a teacher, Phil a cop\u2014but the lack of resolution seems to\r\nbe one of the most haunting elements of daily life. They can\u2019t even bury their\r\nchild. And cops come with pictures of children found on the internet or in\r\nraids and ask if it\u2019s their son. Sarah refuses to even look anymore, while Phil\r\nseems to hold out a glimmer of hope that he\u2019ll be found.  Sarah also happens to be a teacher, a far-too-convenient\r\nstorytelling device for Morano. In an early scene, her students are reading\r\npoetry about how your eyes adjust to the dark\u2014\u201cYou don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to be light again. It might just keep\r\ngetting darker.\u201d This kind of self-aware scripting pops up again and again\r\nin \u201cMeadowland.\u201d The movie actually works best when Sarah and Phil are silent,\r\nas Morano, a cinematographer by trade who also shot this film, captures the gloomy,\r\novercast existence of two people living in misery. The problems lie in Chris\r\nRossi\u2019s over-explanatory script, which almost seems to be pushing and pulling\r\nwith Morano\u2019s more dreamlike visual style and emotional skill with the actors. Advertisement Even the structure of \u201cMeadowland\u201d can be frustrating, as we\r\nwatch Sarah get closer to a student with Asperger\u2019s who is clearly unloved by\r\nhis parents and bullied at school. The idea that a teacher would be drawn to a surrogate\r\nson after losing her own is a fascinating one, but Rossi handles it in a clunky\r\nfashion, not really conveying what Sarah thinks she\u2019ll get out of the relationship.\r\nSimilarly, Phil meets a man (John Leguizamo) at a support group who has a dark\r\nstory of his own. Like the Sarah arc, it\u2019s a narratively frustrating element from the film's too-literal melodrama.\u00a0 Despite those frustrations, \u201cMeadowland\u201d is ample proof yet\r\nagain of the underutilized talents of Olivia Wilde and Luke Wilson. Wilde has a\r\nway of breaking through the overwritten dialogue to find the truth. Her quiet\r\nmoments in the classroom, lost in near-suicidal thought, say more about Sarah\u2019s\r\narc than any line in the film. Despite her striking beauty, she seems to be\r\nfolding in on herself, unable to live in the cruel world. She wears a hoodie, acting look like the air hurts her skin. Wilde is great here, and she\u2019s\r\nmatched by Luke Wilson, another actor who seems to be getting more confident\r\nand interesting with age. They\u2019re the reason to see \u201cMeadowland,\u201d and nearly\r\nrescue the piece from the melodramatic swamp into which it eventually sinks.", "Critic": "Beta"}
