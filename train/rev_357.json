{"Title": "A Most Wanted Man", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Anton Corbijn\u2019s \u201cA Most Wanted Man\u201d has an added and perhaps\r\nunwanted gravity by virtue of forever bearing the title of \u201cThe Last Leading\r\nRole of Philip Seymour Hoffman.\u201d Watching one of the great American actors embody his final leading man gives the entire piece the air of a haunting, particularly\r\nbecause PSH\u2019s character is such a world-weary, melancholic guy, someone who\r\nseems to be out of time and patience. It has been difficult to sever the truth\r\nof cinema\u2019s loss from his characters when watching Hoffman\u2019s work since his\r\npassing but this is the only time in which it feels like his tragic death has\r\nactually changed the final product (it was somehow easier to get past in \"God\u2019s\r\nPocket,\" the \"Capote\" screening at Ebertfest and I imagine it will be in \"Mockingjay\"\r\nlater this year). Corbijn keeps the action of \"A Most Wanted Man\" at arms length or greater, never finding the heart of the piece despite mostly solid performances and strong production values. He allows us to stay disengaged from the narrative itself and to be\r\ndistracted by how much the movie world has lost. Advertisement Hoffman plays Gunther Bachmann, a man trapped in bureaucracy and shackled by a government that doesn\u2019t give him the trust or\r\ntools he needs to do his job. Bachmann is an intelligence expert in Hamburg,\r\nGermany, a place that will never be the same in terms of espionage because it\r\nserved as the home base for the 9/11 hijackers. How did the entire intelligence\r\ncommunity there not see that coming? Since that fateful day, Bachmann and his\r\nteam (which includes Daniel Bruhl and Nina Hoss) have been forced to work on an\r\never-shifting landscape. The government wants to hammer down on any nail that\r\nlooks out of place but Bachmann knows that it\u2019s the long, patient game that\r\nreaps the biggest rewards in the world of espionage. Bachmann stumbles upon one of the biggest cases of his\r\ncareer when a Russian man named Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin) arrives in\r\nHamburg, seeking asylum and his notoriously evil father\u2019s massive fortune. Issa\r\nis a half-Chechen, half-Russian Muslim, a title that raises every possible red\r\nflag in the eyes of Bachmann\u2019s team and those above him. Bachmann\u2019s superiors\r\nwant to grab Issa immediately. Bachmann knows that finding out\u00a0why Issa arrived in Hamburg is more important than just capturing him. So\r\nthe follow game begins.  Issa tracks down a banker (the always-effective Willem Dafoe), seeking his father\u2019s\r\ndirty money. He also forms a friendship with a human rights activist named\r\nAnnabel Richter played hollowly by Rachel McAdams, who ends up an important cog\r\nin Le Carre\u2019s machine, as do a CIA operative played by Robin Wright and a\r\nsuspicious Muslim leader played by Homayoun Ershadi. As in \"Tinker Tailor\r\nSoldier Spy\" and \"The Constant Gardener,\" everyone has a role to play in the\r\nspy game. And it\u2019s remarkable how much tension Le Carre can draw without\r\nmuch violence or traditional action at all. In \"A Most Wanted Man,\" every\r\ndecision, every admittance, every secret revealed or held can collapse the\r\nhouse of cards that Bachmann needs to stay upright to stop another 9/11. It is\r\na vision of the spy game as one of neverending frustrations and roadblocks. Advertisement It is also a cold, distant film; more than it needed to be. \u201cConstant\r\nGardner\u201d and \u201cTinker Tailor\u201d drew audiences into their complex world through\r\ntheir relatable characters, mostly the pair played so expertly by Rachel Weisz\r\nand Gary Oldman, respectively, but Corbijn offers no such channel into \u201cA Most Wanted Man.\u201d\r\nThere are glimpses of humanity in Hoffman\u2019s staccato German-accented delivery\r\nbut the problem comes in the dynamic between Annabel and Issa. This should be\r\nthe heat and emotion of the film, balanced against the cold visual palette that\r\nCorbijn and his team have chosen for the rest of it. Amidst the metal of\r\nsurveillance fans and glass windows of conference rooms in which life and death\r\ndecisions are being made, there is a tortured, broken soul of a Muslim/Chechen\r\nyoung man looking for anything human to latch on to. Sadly, Corbijn doesn\u2019t seem\r\ninterested enough in the characters of Issa and Annabel, making both of them\r\nmere plot devices. Anton Corbijn is a detailed, precise filmmaker, a fact that\r\nbrought a fascinating level of detail to the underrated \"The American.\" Here, his\r\nprecision plays up Le Carre\u2019s hopelessness in a spy game that one knows will\r\nnever work out the right way for all parties involved. In today\u2019s world of\r\nespionage, someone is always going to lose. It's far from a complete failure but the flaws of \u201cA Most Wanted Man\u201d remind us not of how much humanity\r\nand hope we\u2019ve lost internationally since 9/11 but how much we\u2019ve lost by saying\r\ngoodbye to an incredible actor.", "Critic": "Beta"}
