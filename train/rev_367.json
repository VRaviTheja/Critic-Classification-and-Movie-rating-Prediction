{"Title": "The Look of Silence", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Director Joshua Oppenheimer\u2019s \u201cThe Act of Killing,\u201d a most\r\nunusual treatment of mass murder and the people who commit it, galvanized both\r\ndocumentary audiences and filmmakers in 2013. Oppenheimer, a writer, activist,\r\nand conceptual artist, invited the perpetrators of ostensibly-anti-Communist,\r\nstate-sponsored killings in 1960s Indonesia to reenact their deeds as heroic\r\nmovie scenes. The results, I myself noted at the time, were \u201cbracingly\r\nghastly,\u201d and also disturbing in their deeper revelations.  Advertisement Oppenheimer\u2019s new film, \u201cThe Look of Silence,\u201d is a\r\ndeliberate companion piece to \u201cKilling,\u201d and it too is strong and upsetting.\r\nIts conceptual framework isn\u2019t nearly as idiosyncratic as the previous film\u2019s,\r\nand that could be to its advantage. Instead of working with multiple criminal\r\nsubjects, Oppenheimer settles in with the family of one victim. \u201cSilence\u201d tells\r\nthe story of this man\u2019s death\u2014which, because of its circumstances, gained a\r\ncertain symbolic weight with certain Indonesians over time\u2014through the eyes of\r\nhis younger brother, Adi, an optometrist in his early 40s who was born after\r\nthe killings and was seen by his now very-aged parents as, if not a replacement\r\nfor their older child, a kind of proxy for him. The movie opens with Adi watching a television monitor,\r\nlooking at footage in which an older man gleefully recounts a killing. \u201cI\r\nripped him open; his intestines spilled out.\u201d A series of titles tells the\r\nviewer that over one million supposed \u201cCommunists\u201d were murdered during the\r\nperiod of Indonesian turmoil, and that the \u201cperpetrators still hold power\r\nthroughout the country.\u201d Oppenheimer and his cameras follow Adi as he travels\r\naround rural areas of his country, giving eye exams and prescribing glasses for\r\nseveral of his interview subjects, who confess their doings with often shocking\r\nnonchalance. Adi, who explains early on that \u201cWhen I meet older people, I like\r\nto hear about the past,\u201d is an often cheerful, pragmatic fellow who enjoys a\r\nlight-hearted relationship with his own daughter; when he watches the footage\r\nof confessed killers or listens in person to one-time thugs, his face takes on\r\na cast of intense scrutiny, the look of silence to which the film\u2019s title\r\nrefers. In a sense, he teaches the viewer on the other side of the screen how to\r\nprocess these stories.  And what appalling stories they are. \u201cDrinking your victim\u2019s\r\nblood is important, otherwise you\u2019ll go crazy,\u201d one old man tells Adi. A\r\none-time military man brags about trying to solicit a cruise to the U.S.A.\r\nafter completing his killing labors; he\u2019s earned such a thing, he says, because\r\n\u201cWe did this because America taught us to hate Communists.\u201d In the school room\r\nwhere one of Adi\u2019s children is taught, a teacher explains to his charges that\r\nthe \u201cCommunists\u201d had to go because they were \u201ccruel\u201d and would mutilate the\r\nfaces of military Generals who wouldn\u2019t cooperate with them, which is an interesting\r\nlittle fabrication. \u201cSo the communists weren\u2019t cruel?\u201d the child asks Adi later\r\non. It\u2019s a tough question for many reasons, one being that in many, many cases, the \u201cCommunists\u201d weren\u2019t even Communists.  Advertisement Almost as maddening and frightening as this material is the\r\nattitude adopted by some interviewees; \u201cThe wound has healed,\u201d grumbles someone\r\nwho doesn\u2019t want the murders brought up; the irony of someone who had a hand in\r\nperpetrating the wound pronouncing it \u201chealed\u201d is an exasperating one. Then there\u2019s\r\nthe ex-military man who starts lecturing Adi: \u201cDo the relatives of the victims\r\nwant this to start happening again?\u201d he rumbles, quaking a bit. The real danger\r\nthat Adi placed himself in is underscored by the film\u2019s end credits:\r\nOppenheimer\u2019s co-director is called \u201cAnonymous,\u201d and there are over thirty more\r\nacknowledgements of an \u201cAnonymous\u201d as the credits scroll down.  The 2003 documentary \u201cThe Corporation\u201d made much of the U.S.\r\nlegal gymnastics that grant corporations a kind of personhood, along with attendant\r\nrights, and concluded that if a corporation were a person, it would be a\r\nmalevolent sociopath. The portrait of Indonesia that emerges from \u201cThe Act of\r\nKilling\u201d and \u201cThe Look Of Silence\u201d places the national character in a sort of\r\nongoing psychotic fugue state. Post-Holocaust discourse frequently used the\r\nphrase \u201cNever Again\u201d as a slogan, specifically referring to persecution of the\r\nJews but also denoting a prohibition against barbarism; the events under\r\nconsideration in these films are dispiriting reminders that human progress in\r\nthis area has been meager at best.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
