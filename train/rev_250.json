{"Title": "Serena", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have brought such\r\nenergy and chemistry to their relationships in their scenes together in \u201cSilver\r\nLinings Playbook\u201d and \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d that viewers may be tempted to give\r\ntheir latest collaboration some attention despite the stories of\r\npost-production drama and bad buzz that has accompanied it. I certainly\r\napproached it with an It Can\u2019t Be THAT\r\nBad attitude, largely due to my admiration for its stars, but also because I\u2019ve\r\nrespected director Susanne Bier\u2019s work in the past (particularly \u201cBrothers\u201d and\r\n\u201cAfter the Wedding\u201d). Ten minutes in, one can tell something is wrong with \u201cSerena\u201d.\r\nBy the misguided ending, it\u2019s a flat-out disaster, the kind of film that its\r\ncast and crew hope gets buried as quickly as possible as they race to move on\r\nto other projects. Given the fact that it was filmed almost three years ago,\r\nCooper and Lawrence have likely forgotten they made it by now. Follow their\r\nlead. Advertisement It is Depression-era North Carolina and George Pemberton\r\n(Cooper) seems to be one of the few successful businessmen in his mountainous\r\nregion, running a flourishing timber empire. With the assistance of a business\r\npartner named Buchanan (David Dencik) and a spiritually-guided hunter named\r\nGalloway (Rhys Ifans), the Pemberton name is becoming well-known, although the\r\nlocal Sheriff (Toby Jones) suspects something is afoot. Into this empire falls\r\na Lady MacBeth in the form of Serena Shaw (Jennifer Lawrence), who quickly\r\nbecomes Serena Pemberton (over such memorable lines as \u201cI think we should be married.\u201d Smile. End scene.) Serena rubs everyone but George the wrong way. She barges\r\ninto the lumber company ordering people around and accusing them of doing six\r\nmonths of work in nine months. She is clearly designed as a force of change,\r\nfirst feeling competition for George\u2019s business from Buchanan and then feeling competition\r\nfor his legacy from a townswoman who happens to be the mother to George\u2019s\r\nillegitimate child. But Serena, despite Lawrence\u2019s best efforts isn\u2019t a\r\ncharacter. She has melodramatic emotions and plot twists forced upon her with\r\nno depth or thematic resonance to any of it. She bends to the will of a\r\nmanipulative narrative as if no one ever paused to answer questions of motive\r\nor back story for this character. Why does she feel so strongly for George? Why\r\ndoes she take center stage in one scene but pull back in another? She is\r\nmaddeningly inconsistent, and so the film has a thematic vacuum in the middle\r\nof its narrative. Who is the title character and why do we care about her should\r\nbe two of the first questions asked when crafting a screenplay like \u201cSerena\u201d.\r\nThey never were here. It doesn\u2019t help that Bier finds a way to over-direct and\r\nunder-direct in alternately frustrating manners. The first act is filled with\r\nan overuse of score, gauzy camerawork and slow-mo montages of people riding\r\nhorseback and making love by candlelight. But as the narrative gets darker and\r\ndeath enters this little world, Bier loses the romantic, old-fashioned\r\nfilmmaking style, and the entire affair just becomes dour and depressing, which\r\nis all the more startling given the two typically-vibrant actors who star in\r\nit. None of it feels organic, genuine, or even moderately entertaining. It is a\r\nfilm in which performers and crew go through the motions in such a way that one\r\ncan sense that they knew, long before production wrapped, that something was\r\nwrong. Maybe that\u2019s why it took so long to come out. Even the people who made\r\nit didn\u2019t want to finish it. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
