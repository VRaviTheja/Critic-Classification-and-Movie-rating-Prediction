{"Title": "My Life Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "I\u2019m a sucker for a great behind-the-scenes moviemaking\r\ndocumentary. \u201cHearts of Darkness\u201d and \u201cBurden of Dreams\u201d are must-sees, and the\r\nfirst thing I look at when Criterion announces their monthly releases is the list\r\nof special features, often as insightful and educational as a great film book\r\nor even a lecture in a class. And I count myself among fans of Nicolas Winding\r\nRefn, drawn in by \u201cPusher\u201d & \u201cBronson\u201d and blown away by \u201cDrive\u201d. (He also\r\nhappened to be a fascinating, seemingly kind man when I interviewed him.) So, a\r\ndocumentary short (it\u2019s only 58 minutes but is being released in theaters)\r\nabout the pressure on Refn during the production of the divisive \u201cOnly God\r\nForgives\u201d should be in my proverbial wheelhouse. And yet this sweet,\r\nsemi-informative doc never quite rises above \u201cHome Movies\u201d or \u201cDVD Special\r\nFeature\u201d status to really illuminate either process or artist. I walked away\r\nfrom \u201cMy Life Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn\u201d having enjoyed the time spent\r\nwith Refn, his family, and Ryan Gosling, but without any further insight into\r\nthe production of \u201cOnly God Forgives,\u201d filmmaking in general or this particular\r\ntalent. Advertisement \u201cMy Life Directed\u201d opens with the scene that gave me my\r\nbiggest smile over the entire piece as Refn and the great Alejandro Jodorowsky\r\nare having a conversation that ends with the influential filmmaker giving him a\r\ntarot card reading about his soon-to-shoot follow-up to \u201cDrive.\u201d Just the idea\r\nthat Refn and Jodorowsky hang out (he comes back later in the film and fans will remember Refn was a memorable interview subject in \"Jodorowsky's Dune\") talking\r\nabout life, art, and craft fascinates me, and I was hoping the film would\r\nfulfill on that opening scene, featuring the kind of intellectual dissection of passion versus expectation that this introduction sets up. Sadly, director Liv\r\nCorfixen, who also happens to be Refn\u2019s wife, never finds the focus for her\r\npiece, sketching the production in episodic, brief interludes with her partner\r\nbut seemingly missing the most important conversations about how \u201cOnly God\r\nForgives\u201d got made. What separates \u201cMy Life Directed\u201d is the fact that while\r\nCorfixen may not have gotten the kind of Jodo-Refn conversations one would hope\r\nfor, she gets a raw, unfiltered, husband version of a world-renowned filmmaker.\r\nSo, we see Refn in bed, clearly wracked by nerves as to how \u201cOnly God Forgives\u201d\r\nwill be received by the rest of the world. He clearly loves the film, but he is\r\nobsessed, from pre-production through premiere night, with the idea that\r\naudiences will be disappointed in the fact that it\u2019s not \u201cDrive 2.\u201d This documentary\r\nmay work best viewed in conjunction with the feature because one could easily\r\nargue that the film\u2019s flaws sprung from the filmmaker\u2019s lack of confidence in\r\nhis own vision. Which brings us back to the idea that \u201cMy Life Directed by\r\nNicolas Winding Refn\u201d is a great special feature, or a bonus disc in an\r\ninevitable box set of Refn\u2019s works. It feels supplemental more than essential.", "Critic": "Beta"}
