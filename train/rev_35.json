{"Title": "McCanick", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "When\r\n fans of beloved character actor David Morse say that they wish he could\r\n star in his own movie, \"McCanick\" is not what they have in mind. As \r\ndirected by Josh C. Waller and written by Daniel Noah, the movie is a \r\ntedious, often incompetently assembled mass of cop-on-the-edge clich\u00e9s.\u00a0 Morse\r\n stars as the title character, a grizzled Philadelphia police detective.\r\n The movie follows McCanick over the course of a single workday, his \r\n59th\u00a0birthday, as he rampages through the city, busting heads and \r\nscreaming threats. In theory, this chaos is in service of tracking down a\r\n recently released felon named Simon Weeks (Cory Monteith), a street \r\nhustler whom McCanick put behind bars seven years earlier. But it's \r\nreally in service of standard-issue dirty cop mayhem. Advertisement As\r\n clumsily written flashbacks pile up, we piece together the bigger \r\npicture of McCanick's history with Weeks: they met while McCanick was \r\ninvestigating a politician's murder. McCanick's commanding officer \r\n(Ciaran Hinds) hints that sleeping dogs should be let lie, but McCanick \r\nwon't listen; we discover the terrible secret that binds McCanick to \r\nWeeks, but only after enduring a repetitive series of \"searing\" \r\nconfrontations between the hero and various perps, accomplices, and \r\nrandom citizens, including a scene in which McCanick intimidates a \r\nroomful of tough guys by playing \"spin the pistol.\" There's\r\n also an unremarkable mentor-pupil relationship, with McCanick training a\r\n handsome young patrolman (Mike Vogel) who does things by the book and \r\nis appalled by the hero's can't-make-an-omelette-without-breaking-skulls\r\n attitude. The movie seems content to alternate between imitating \"Bad \r\nLieutenant\" and imitating \"Training Day,\" minus the genuine spiritual torment \r\nof the former and the sleek preposterousness of the latter.\u00a0 With\r\n his menacing bulk and soulful eyes, Morse lends the material more \r\ndignity and heft than it deserves, and there are a few affecting moments\r\n between him and Monteith, who died of a heroin overdose last year at \r\n31. (This is his final screen performance.) The movie has a suitably unsettling look, somewhere between a TV-14 cable police drama and a poverty row film noir. Waller and cinematographer Martin Alghren embrace darkness, favoring silhouettes and half-shadowed faces when they're justified, and sometimes when they aren't. A few scenes play much longer than you expected, generating an odd tension. You wonder: Are we still here because the filmmakers don't know when to quit, or because they're lulling us into complacency to set up a sucker punch? But none of these virtues \u00a0compensate for the film's shallow, derivative script and direction. \r\nWhen a goon in the spin-the-pistol scene asks McCanick \"what are you \r\nPopeye f------g Doyle?\" it seems meant as a self-aware preemptive \r\nstrike against criticism, but it's merely descriptive. \"McCanick\" barely\r\n has a frame it can claim as its own. It shambles\u00a0in the shadows of similar but richer films, and never hits its own stride.", "Critic": "Delta"}
