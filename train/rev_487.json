{"Title": "Bird People", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Pascale Ferran\u2019s \u201cBird People\u201d contains two complementary\r\ndramas within its unique structure; neither of them completely work. While\r\nthere are some phenomenal twists of the narrative knife in this unique story of\r\na flier who grounds himself and an earthbound woman who takes flight, \u201cBird\r\nPeople\u201d also includes wildly aggravating tonal and pacing issues. It\u2019s a film\r\nabout jumping into the void, taking that risk that we have all considered\r\ntaking at one point or another in our lives. We all reach moments in our\r\nexistence where we\u2019re tempted to just take flight, leave the world behind.\r\nFamily, friends and obligations usually keep us from doing so, but the urge to\r\nleave it all behind never fully disappears. Advertisement Gary (the always-good Josh Charles, who reportedly got this\r\npart through his fantastic work on \u201cIn Treatment\u201d) is the man who jumps into\r\nthat void when he decides, after a few dull business meetings, that he\u2019s not\r\nleaving Paris. He\u2019s not going on to his next meeting in Dubai. He\u2019s not\r\nreturning home to the States. He\u2019s quitting his job. He\u2019s leaving his wife and\r\nfamily. And he\u2019s not even sure what he\u2019s doing next or where he\u2019s going next. Gary\r\ncalls his co-workers and breaks the news. And he has an emotional, devastating\r\nconversation with his wife (Radha Mitchell) via Skype. In detailed, heartbreaking beats, we watch a man tell his partner that he won\u2019t be coming home. Sure, there\u2019s\r\nan implication of love lost between the two of them a long time ago, but it\u2019s\r\nstill hard to fathom a man leaving so much responsibility behind him like an\r\nunused plane ticket. After Gary\u2019s life has been disassembled to the point that he\u2019s\r\nfree from all tethers, a maid named Audrey (Ana\u00efs Demoustier) similarly throws\r\noff her traditional structure in a way that I won\u2019t spoil (but the title\r\ncertainly hints at it). The second half of \u201cBird People\u201d replaces the realism\r\nof the first half with fantasy elements that thematically complement the first.\r\nThis is a film about people breaking free, and when they realize that common\r\nsubtext to their lives at the end of the story, it has some undeniable thematic\r\nresonance. However, it takes WAY too long to get there. Ferran is prone\r\nto \u201cflights of fancy,\u201d pardon the pun, as some scenes in her film go on unchecked while others aren\u2019t allowed nearly the right amount of time to develop.\r\nThe scene in which Gary officially breaks his marriage is interminable, with\r\nlong silences and what sound like improvised emotional beats. I\u2019m sure one\r\ncould argue that this enhances the realism of the scene, but that doesn\u2019t make\r\nit entertaining. And the key fantasy sequence in the movie is one that I never\r\nthought would end. There\u2019s a much stronger, tighter, captivating version of \u201cBird\r\nPeople\u201d buried in this bloated take on a unique story. \u201cBird People\u201d is a movie for which it\u2019s tempting to make\r\nexcuses. I like Charles\u2019 work here. As he was on \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d he\u2019s so\r\ncompletely in the moment. He doesn\u2019t overplay beats, and I hope he soon gets a\r\npart that really takes him to the next level in terms of international\r\nattention. Demoustier is a charming young actress. And there are clearly\r\ninteresting ideas taking flight here. It\u2019s the execution of the flight plan\r\nthat keeps them from reaching their destination. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
