{"Title": "The Little Prince", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s \u201cLe Petit Prince\u201d has been\r\ntranslated into more than 250 languages and reportedly sold over 140 million\r\ncopies worldwide. It is in millions of homes, having been read to millions of\r\nchildren. There have been radio plays, television adaptations and film\r\nversions. So why tell this story again? Could Mark Osborne, the director of \u201cKung\r\nFu Panda,\u201d really have something new to say regarding this timeless tale? And\r\nhow do you adapt a relatively thin novella into a feature film that will keep\r\nkids entertained and adults entranced? \u201cThe Little Prince,\u201d premiering on\r\nNetflix this Friday after Paramount inexplicably dumped it earlier this year\r\n(and after it has made almost $100 million worldwide) takes the themes of its\r\nsource material and expands on them to create a lovely, big-hearted tale of\r\nadventure, friendship and imagination. Without a single pop song to be heard or\r\na bodily humor joke to be endured, \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d doesn\u2019t talk down to its\r\naudience, treating them with the respect that so few American family films\r\nbother to do. It is a cinematic crime that the abrasive garbage that is \u201cThe\r\nAngry Birds Movie\u201d and \u201cIce Age: Collision Course\u201d get national releases while\r\nmost people don\u2019t even know \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d is coming to win their hearts\r\nthis weekend. Advertisement Osborne and his team shift focus to a new protagonist, \u201cThe Little\r\nGirl\u201d (beautifully, richly voiced by Mackenzie Foy), a smart heroine who is\r\nessentially being trained by her mother (Rachel McAdams) for the big, dangerous\r\nworld of being an adult. She\u2019s trying to get into the prestigious Werth Academy\r\nand her mother has her entire summer vacation planned out on a big board. Let\u2019s\r\njust say, in this community in which all the homes look identical and every\r\nneighborhood is designed like a grid, this poor girl is going to be doing a lot\r\nof studying and not a lot of playing. Until she meets her neighbor. While her single mother is at work, The Little Girl strikes\r\nup a friendship with the old man who lives next door. In a house that contains\r\nall the curves and quirks missing from the rest of the neighborhood, \u201cThe\r\nAviator\u201d (Jeff Bridges) tells his new friends stories, including the time he\r\nmet \u201cThe Little Prince.\u201d The details of The Aviator\u2019s stories aren\u2019t nearly as\r\nimportant as the themes they convey. As The Aviator relays stories of \u201cThe Rose\u201d\r\n(Marion Cotillard), \u201cThe Fox\u201d (James Franco), \u201cThe Snake\u201d (Benicio Del Toro),\r\nand others, we watch The Little Girl come out of her shell. She\u2019s fascinated by\r\nThe Aviator\u2019s drawings (which will be familiar to fans of the book) and learns\r\nthe lessons that they just don\u2019t teach you at school, even the Werth Academy. As\r\nit should be, \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d is heavy with philosophical observations like\r\n\u201cGrowing up is not the problem, forgetting is\u201d and \u201cIt is only with the heart\r\nthat one can see rightly.\u201d It\u2019s notable that Osborne and company aren't afraid\r\nof deeper themes. It could have been tempting to turn \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d\r\ninto a wacky adventure movie (I guarantee there have been scripts of that\r\nnature on Hollywood desks), but Osborne\u2019s take is deeply emotional and\r\nheartfelt. It gets a little repetitive in the mid-section, but the final act,\r\nwhich I won\u2019t spoil, essentially brings The Aviator\u2019s stories and lessons to\r\nlife, making the journey worthwhile.\u00a0 It helps one overlook the narrative and philosophical repetition that the film\r\nis accomplished on a technical level as well. Most notably, the score,\r\nco-composed by Hans Zimmer, is a lyrical, lovely piece of work. It carries the\r\nviewer along, fluidly tying together the worlds of \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d (both\r\nthe girl\u2019s and the story of the prince). Visually, the first act of the film, with its\r\nsquare trees to match its square houses, reminded me of the suburban rigidity\r\nof the first act of Brad Bird\u2019s \u201cThe Incredibles,\u201d \u00a0while visions of the world of the title character\r\nreminded me of LAIKA gems like \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cParanorman.\u201d These are good\r\ncomparisons to make when one watches a family film. It\u2019s in good company. Advertisement Ultimately, \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d is a film that everyone should be happy to show their children. They might get a little bored, but if\r\nthey even take away a positive theme or two, it\u2019s worthwhile. And, in the end,\r\nadults might remember an important truth about the world as well. Becoming an\r\nadult doesn\u2019t mean giving up on dreams, whimsy, imagination or love. It\u2019s a\r\nlesson that children\u2019s fiction has been teaching us since long before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\r\npublished his hit novella. And yet in a world that seems increasingly dominated\r\nby hate speech and stories of violence, it\u2019s one that we could stand to learn\r\nagain.", "Critic": "Beta"}
