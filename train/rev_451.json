{"Title": "Level Five", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The late French filmmaker Chris Marker, who died in 2012 at\r\nthe age of 91, was a pioneer of what some critics call the \u201cessay film,\u201d but\r\nhe\u2019s best known for his (perhaps) entirely fictional short, the seminal 1962\r\ntime-travel tale \u201cLa Jet\u00e9e.\u201d That less-than-a-half-hour movie is a massive\r\ninfluence on almost every sci-fi piece on time-travel since, not to mention a\r\ndirect, credited inspiration for Terry Gilliam\u2019s visionary feature \u201cTwelve\r\nMonkeys.\u201d\u00a0 He never made another film\r\nlike it, at least directly like it. But every one of his nearly 60 other films\r\nare intimately tied to that masterpiece, because they are all about human perception\r\nand history and memory, and how they all warp our lives.  Advertisement His 1997 movie \u201cLevel Five\u201d is only now getting a release in\r\nthe United States, and it\u2019s a fascinating hybrid. Shot with low-budget\r\nequipment suited to a putatively rough-and-ready aesthetic, it\u2019s a fictional\r\ndocumentary examining the battle of Okinawa in World War II, a conflict that,\r\nby Marker\u2019s lights, helped usher in the terrifying atomic age in which we still\r\nlive. Marker\u2019s other works, remarkable movies such as \u201cA Grin Without A Cat\u201d and\r\n\u201cSans soleil,\u201d bracing, personally inflected treatments of historical studies\r\nand anthropology, established the filmmaker as someone for whom the idea of\r\n\u201cobjective\u201d history is thoroughly objectionable. So here he treats Okinawa\r\nthrough a fictionally contrived premise: the labors of Laura (Catherine\r\nBelkhodja) a computer enthusiast and video game developer, as she tries to\r\ndevelop a strategy game based on the battle\u2014a cyber rewrite of history, in a\r\nsense. Marker\u2019s narrator lightly interrogates Laura, who keeps a video diary of\r\nsorts, and teases the unseen filmmaker with personal reminiscences of their\r\nrelationship, for instance, recollecting the first time they heard David\r\nRaksin\u2019s musical theme to Otto Preminger\u2019s film \u201cLaura\u201d together.  \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with Okinawa?\u201d you may well ask now,\r\nand I\u2019m not sure the movie will give you a satisfactory answer. All of Marker\u2019s\r\nphilosophical explorations are tinged, at the very least, by his own cinephilia\r\n(like many French filmmakers of his generation, he was active as a critic and\r\nin a sense remained so throughout his life), and for those who like their\r\nprobings into historical trauma straight down the alley and digression-free,\r\n\u201cLevel Five\u201d will be a very frustrating and arguably overly French experience.\r\nI say \u201cFrench\u201d because the movie partakes in a kind of discourse that\u2019s very\r\nmuch in a French intellectual tradition, the discursive semiotic inquiry in\r\nwhich one\u2019s own cast of mind is necessarily grist for the cerebral mill. In\r\nother words, it\u2019s Marker\u2019s position that he cannot make a film \u201cabout\u201d Okinawa\r\neven if he and his cinematographer travel and shoot there (which they did); he\r\ncan only make a film about thinking about Okinawa. That being what this is, if\r\nyou can hook into it, \u201cLevel Five\u201d is not just witty, insinuating, and\r\npenetrating; it\u2019s also unexpectedly moving and, as deliberately threadbare as\r\nit often looks, cinematically rich. Its imagery derives directly from a time\r\nwhen computer graphics were so much cruder than they\u2019ve become that it\u2019s almost\r\ndifficult to believe. Laura\u2019s interaction with protocols, mysterious\r\nindividuals in user groups and chat rooms of the late \u201890s, underscores the way\r\ntechnology is constantly seeming to redefine epistemology; this makes \u201cLevel\r\nFive\u201d a kind of prophetic text in a way perhaps Marker himself didn\u2019t even\r\nanticipate. Is it a \u201cmasterpiece?\u201d Who\u2019s to say; but like every other film\r\nMarker made, it\u2019s an exemplary and resonant address on the life of the mind and\r\nthe life outside of that one.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
