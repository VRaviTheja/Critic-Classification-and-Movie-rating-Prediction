{"Title": "Only Yesterday", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "2014\u2019s U.S. release of Isao Takahata\u2019s amazing animated swan song \u201cThe Tale of the Princess Kaguya\u201d was a gift and a miracle in and of itself, but it\u2019s also yielding some dividends. The first great movie of 2016, as far as U.S. releases go, is an animated picture that was made in 1991: Takahata\u2019s breathtakingly beautiful and quietly but devastatingly moving \u201cOnly Yesterday,\u201d seeing its first screenings here in both its original Japanese-language version and a scrupulously English-dubbed edition featuring the voice talents of Daisy Ridley, Dev Patel, and Ashley Eckstein.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cOnly Yesterday\u201d is one of a very distinguished handful of feature films that Takahata directed for Studio Ghibli, the outfit founded by Takahata\u2019s friend and frequent collaborator Hayao Miyazaki. Takahata\u2019s work has been marked by a determination to take on stories that U.S. viewers wouldn\u2019t necessarily associate with animation, for instance his 1988 World War II survival drama \u201cGrave of the Fireflies.\u201d He\u2019s also shown interest in expanding and changing up the aesthetic of anime, as in his 1999 \u201cMy Neighbors the Yamadas,\u201d designed in the seemingly minimalist style of Japanese comic strips. \u201cKaguya,\u201d which Takahata announced would be the last film he would direct, was a kind of grand summation of his work in terms of both form and content. \u201cOnly Yesterday\u201d is a good companion piece for a number of reasons\u2014like \u201cKaguya,\u201d it functions as a highly sensitive and empathetic consideration of the situation of women in Japanese society\u2014but it\u2019s also a breathtaking work of art on its own.\u00a0 There\u2019s no fantasy or supernatural element in the movie, but that\u2019s not to say that it entirely eschews the fantastic. The main character is a kind of young Japanese everywoman, or everywoman nonconformist. Taeko is a 27-year-old single salarywoman in 1982 Tokyo. The movie begins with her telling a work colleague that she\u2019s off to visit relatives in the countryside. Truth is, she has no actual close relatives there, but rather has signed up to help the family of her brother-in-law\u2019s older brother in her destination to harvest safflowers.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to bring my fifth-grade self along for the trip,\u201d Ridley, speaking with a U.S. accent (for those keeping track, Ridley is British and speaks with her native accent in this independent film called \u201cThe Force Awakens;\u201d her costar in that film, John Boyega, also hails from England but speaks in that film with an American accent; it\u2019s called acting, in case this all worries you), muses on the soundtrack of the English-dubbed version. And yet here she is. On the train, Taeko relates and relives events from her childhood. Some funny and charming, but most of them sad and disturbing. The mockery of more popular girls, the awkwardness of waiting for first menstruation, the cruel coldness of a father who refuses to allow her to participate in a semi-pro theatrical endeavor. The persistent squashing of her hopes and dreams helps make her eventual adult solitude make some kind of sense, but the film is not so crude as to make an overt insistence on cause-and-effect. The movie allows Taeko to keep some secrets, in a sense. As I mentioned, there are no overt fantasy elements in the story but the animated format allows visual metaphors for feelings to come to life. On the rare occasion when fifth-grade Taeko feels like she\u2019s floating on air, she floats, and a big pink heart appears in the sky. In the flashback sequences, Takahata\u2019s spectacular use of negative space\u2014the details of a softball field stretching out into a big field of white in the frame, for instance\u2014gives a palpable sense of a world only partially regained to the senses. Advertisement Once Taeko reaches her destination, she strikes up a friendship with young farmhand Toshio, with whom she talks out more of her mid-\u201860s trauma. The possibility of a romance is broached, but the film\u2019s ending, while tear-jerkingly satisfying, is \u2026 well, you ought to see it yourself. That it plays under the final credits is noteworthy.\u00a0 The English language version keeps the movie intact (I actually saw it for the first time in an unsubtitled Japanese version, via a laser disc I bought in Japan in the early \u201890s, such was my Studio Ghibli fandom at the time), Beatles references and cigarette-smoking characters and all.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
