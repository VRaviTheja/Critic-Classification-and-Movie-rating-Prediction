{"Title": "Arrival", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Much has been written about the recent surge of personal stories being told through the horror genre in films like \u201cIt Follows,\u201d \u201cThe Witch\u201d and \u201cThe Babadook,\u201d but there\u2019s an equally interesting trend in the science fiction genre as well. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen the genre used not only to examine the power of space travel or a post-apocalyptic future but as a way to address common humanity more than futuristic adventure stories. Joining films like \u201cGravity,\u201d \u201cInterstellar\u201d and \u201cThe Martian\u201d is Denis Villeneuve\u2019s ambitious and moving \u201cArrival,\u201d a movie that\u2019s about the day the universe changed forever but becomes more focused on a single story even as it\u2019s expanding its worldwide narrative. It is more about grief, time, communication and compassion than it is warp speed, and it\u2019s a film that asks questions. How do we approach that which terrifies us? Why is it important to communicate through language and not action? The final act of \u201cArrival\u201d gets to the big ideas of life that I won\u2019t spoil here, but viewers should know that Villeneuve\u2019s film is not the crowdpleaser of \"The Martian,\" Ridley Scott\u2019s big TIFF premiere last year. It\u2019s a movie designed to simultaneously challenge viewers, move them and get them talking. For the most part, it succeeds. Advertisement Amy Adams gives a confident, affecting performance as Louise, a linguistics expert brought in on the day that 12 unidentified flying objects enter Earth\u2019s orbit. Despite what they\u2019re telling the public\u2014which is not much of anything at first\u2014the governments of the world have made first contact with the creatures inside, beings that look vaguely like some higher power merged an octopus with a giant hand. Working with the military and a scientist named Ian (Jeremy Renner), Louise seeks to find the answer to a very simple question: What do you want? The Heptapods, as they\u2019re eventually called, speak in sounds that echo whale noises at times, but Louise quickly learns that written language is the way to communicate, even deciphering the complex way the interstellar tourists write. As she gets closer and closer to being able to convey that crucial question in a way that it (and its answer) will be understood, the world\u2019s uneasiness continues. Will man\u2019s protective instinct kick in before its science and language leaders can figure out a way to stop it? Louise also has darkness in her life. The opening scenes detail the birth, brief life and death of a child. Throughout, Adams imbues Louise with a quiet, effective emotional undercurrent that\u2019s essential to the film\u2019s success. This is a movie that gets too sterile at times, but Adams is always there to ground it. Villeneuve\u2019s vision is not particularly CGI-heavy, allowing Adams to work in a way that feels relatable. There\u2019s so much going on in this character\u2019s mind and heart, especially in the twisty final act, with which Adams could have \u201cgone big,\u201d but it\u2019s actually one of the more subtle and internal sci-fi movie performances that I\u2019ve ever seen. And it\u2019s a testament to the success of \u201cArrival\u201d that it\u2019s her face\u2014not the impressive alien ship/creature design\u2014that people will remember. As he has recently, Villeneuve understands the importance of surrounding himself with talented people. In this case, two of the film\u2019s undeniable MVPs are cinematographer Bradford Young, the genius who shot \u201cSelma\u201d and \u201cA Most Violent Year\u201d and composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson. The latter\u2019s compositions here are essential to every emotional beat of the film, defining the air of tension in the first half of the film and the moving undercurrents of the final act. Young\u2019s approach is beautifully tactile, using the natural world to make this unnatural story genuine. We may not be able to fully relate to Louise\u2019s narrative, but we can appreciate the image of a child running through a field. Young\u2019s imagery is fluid, unlike the choppy blockbuster cinematography that we\u2019re used to seeing in sci-fi. Most importantly, it feels like everything here is of one vision\u2014cinematography, direction, acting, score, etc.\u2014instead of the factory-produced blockbusters we\u2019ve seen of late. Advertisement Despite all of that, \u201cArrival\u201d sags a bit in the middle, a point when it may lose some viewers for good. The \u201cfirst contact\u201d act is undeniably confident and the final thematically purposeful scenes of the film are stunningly ambitious, but the pace of \u201cArrival\u201d softens a bit too much in the middle and one notices the sterility of the piece overall. Without spoiling anything, maintaining the shock value of the twists of the final act forces some narrative decisions in the mid-section that keep us observers to the action of the film when we\u2019re ready to be participants. Villeneuve is a talented director, but this movie lacks a degree of heat that would have helped it hit the emotional and philosophical beats of the final scenes. As is, we often feel like we\u2019re behind the barrier that Louise uses when communicating with the alien creatures she dubs Abbott and Costello. Like she wants to do, we so want to take off the equipment and get behind that screen.\u00a0 Having said that, this is ambitious, accomplished filmmaking that deserves an audience. It\u2019s a film that forces viewers to reconsider that which makes us truly human, and the impact of grief on that timeline of existence. At its best, and largely through Adams\u2019 performance, the film proposes that we\u2019ve all had those days in which communication breaks down and fear over the unknown sets in. And it is the best of us who persevere, get up from being knocked down and repair that which is broken.
