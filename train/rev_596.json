{"Title": "Spider-Man: Homecoming", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "I am a little out of touch with the inside-baseball commentary on superhero movie and sci-fi franchises, so I have to ask the reader to indulge me a bit. I\u2019m perhaps not the best person to draw the distinction between something called \u201cfan servicing,\u201d which I understand is very, very bad, and giving an audience what it wants, which I have been told from an early age is at least kind of good. That said, I can report from where I sat at a preview screening that was evenly divided between what I suspect were sympathetic-from-the-get-go reviewers and enthusiastic fans and their families, \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d is a comprehensively crowd-pleasing success.  Advertisement This is the second movie to star Tom Holland as Spider-Man in this incarnation (after \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d). Both the superhero and his high-school-student alter-ego (or is it the other way around? That\u2019s another thing I can be hazy on) Peter Parker, are presented at their most awkwardly adolescent. In the timeline of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d begins directly after Spider-Man\u2019s participation in a superhero gang fight in 2016\u2019s \u201cCivil War.\u201d But the movie itself begins eight years prior to that, in the aftermath of Loki unleashing the Chitauri, which trashed much of NYC and the Avengers\u2019 sleek headquarters in 2012\u2019s \u201cThe Avengers.\u201d (That\u2019s a 2012 movie, and it\u2019s only 2017 now, but don\u2019t look at me, I\u2019m just going by the on-screen texts.) In the wreck of the Avengers\u2019 HQ, Michael Keaton\u2019s hard-working salvage dude Adrian Toomes is showing a colleague a drawing of the Avengers scrawled by Toomes\u2019 own ten-year-old child. Those in the audience with a familiarity with possibly fake Chekhov quotes will recognize this as the gun on the mantelpiece in Act One that is obliged to go off in Act Three, and by Odin, off it does indeed go, but it\u2019s a long way from Act One to Act Three. Soon Toomes and his crew are kicked off the site by an officious Tyne Daly and it\u2019s revealed that Tony Stark is ostensibly self-dealing by heading a government clean-up crew to handle the superhero mess. To give credit to the six screenwriters on this movie, the oodles of rather convoluted plot detail are relatively clear even if you\u2019re not super-paying-attention.  \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d sees Peter Parker being shunted aside by his adult mentors Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) to tackle the more down-to-earth challenges of high school on his own. These include Parker\u2019s pushy best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon), who wants to know all about Peter\u2019s \u201cinternship\u201d at Stark Enterprises; the High School Academic Decathlon (College Bowl for high schoolers, that is), whose captain Liz (Laura Harrier) Peter has a major crush on; and Peter\u2019s guardian Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) from whom Peter must hide his amateur crime-fighting activities as Spider Man, and protect from the possibly wayward affections of a local sandwich shop manager.  This version of Peter Parker is less cocky than the prior incarnations of recent years. He is also rather whiny a lot of he time. The Peter Parker I grew up with was agonizingly tetchy, but he didn\u2019t hunch over like a weasel whenever he had to get out of a social situation to go fight crime. While Holland hunches over with sincerity and skill, I have to admit I am not enthralled by this variation on the teen superhero\u2019s alter-ego (I don\u2019t think I got it right this time either). Peter Parker as nerd, I can roll with; Peter Parker as dork, not so much. Advertisement That said, once the movie gets all its ducks in a row (and after serving up a Queens-set crime fighting foray that highlights some of the movie\u2019s worst visual effects, looking flat-out like video game action for most of its length), it delivers some genuinely effective action/suspense set pieces, including one set in the Washington Monument that worked me up a treat. A subsequent near-disaster on the Staten Island Ferry is less effective, but does lead to the movie\u2019s most effective narrative coup. That is, the nifty Spidey suit that Stark afforded Parker is taken away, and \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d has to swing to its thrilling climax with its hero in a very low-rent outfit. Is this the opposite of \u201cfan-serving,\u201d or is it \u201cfan-serving\u201d itself, presented in a cleverly inverted form? I cannot say. I can say that the film\u2019s adaptation of one of the original \u201cSpider Man\u201d comic\u2019s most graphically exceptional scenes, from 1966\u2019s Issue 33, \u201cThe Final Chapter!\u201d um, isn\u2019t as good as the comic book was, quite honestly. But I give director Jon Watts and the other seventy thousand craftspersons involved in this production credit for trying.  I can\u2019t emphasize enough that these are my personal impressions, and I understand they are probably going to be out of step with those of the masses of people who are going to attend this movie and have a good time with it. This is a picture designed to provide bright vivid thrills and breezy bits of amusement. As someone who\u2019s kind of trained to notice such things, I might say \u201cThis movie really wastes the talents of Hannibal Buress and Martin Starr\u201d; whereas a less concerned person will see these performers and say, \u201cOh yeah, those guys are funny.\u201d Marvel movies are not concerned with altering your precious bodily fluids. This one is a slightly better than average example of the species. Watch it in good health.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
