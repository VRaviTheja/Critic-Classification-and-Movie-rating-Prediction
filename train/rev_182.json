{"Title": "Entourage", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "By the bitter end of its eight-season run, HBO\u2019s \u201cEntourage\u201d\r\nhad twisted its own narrative to a degree that it was barely recognizable from\r\nthe beginning of the series. When it started, \u201cEntourage\u201d was the story of\r\nthree average guys and their decidedly not average best friend with the\r\nmovie-star good looks, trying to make it in the cutthroat world of Hollywood\r\nwith only their loyalty to each other and NYC roots to keep them above the\r\nspoiled fray. We could relate to Vinny, Eric, Johnny and Turtle. By the end,\r\nthe boys of \u201cEntourage\u201d were men, and they were the exact kind of narcissists\r\nthat the show felt like it mocked at the beginning. Success was the most\r\nimportant thing in their lives, and the show became little more than a story of\r\na dream fulfilled, despite the occasional laugh. It wasn\u2019t about the guy who\r\nwent to Hollywood and stayed himself, bro. It was about the guy who went to\r\nHollywood and slept with models, had all the new toys, won awards, etc., bro.  Advertisement Four years after \u201cEntourage\u201d went off the air (although it\r\nfeels much longer), creator Doug Ellin is back with the inevitable film version\r\nof his show, continuing the same tonal problems of the last few seasons of the program only in a longer, bigger, more misogynist form. Much like the series, even in its lowest\r\npoints, there are still a few laughs from the supporting cast, and Ellin paces\r\nthe piece well (it doesn\u2019t feel nearly as long as the neverending \u201cSex and the\r\nCity\u201d movies), but \u201cEntourage\u201d mistakenly keeps its characters floating in\r\nrarefied air, giving us no way to relate to them or care about them. Vinny and\r\nhis buddies have become easier to correlate with the Kardashians than the\r\ndreamers they used to be. And that makes for a film that keeps its audience at\r\na distance, never surprising them at all narratively and barely moving the\r\nneedle for its characters. It is fan fiction in film form. After ending a marriage that lasted only nine days with a\r\nhot person party in Ibiza (\u201cEntourage\u201d takes place in that dream movie world in\r\nwhich every extra in every scene from the people walking down the\r\nstreet to all the patrons of a restaurant could be a fashion model),\r\nVinny Chase (Adrian Grenier) wants to get back in the movie game. He calls up\r\nAri (Jeremy Piven) and convinces him to re-join his team as the producer on his\r\nnext flick, a futuristic take on the Stevenson classic, \u201cHyde.\u201d One catch:\r\nVinny wants to direct.  Ellin\u2019s script ignores most of the production process, immediately\r\nzipping us forward to days after filming has wrapped. Ari and his producing\r\npartners, including Texan walking-stereotype financiers played by Billy Bob\r\nThornton and Haley Joel Osment, still haven\u2019t seen a cut of the film, which\r\nVinny is clearly apprehensive about showing to anyone. Part of the problem is\r\nthat he needs more money on the already over-budget film to finish\r\npost-production. Ari agrees to go to Texas to talk to the money men about\r\ngetting the cash, but Chase is going to have to get over his nerves and show\r\nthe movie to everybody soon. Advertisement Meanwhile, E (Kevin Connolly) is having a baby with Sloan\r\n(Emmanuelle Chriqui) even though the two aren\u2019t together any more. Which means\r\nhe gets to have sex with multiple people one day and go to Lamaze the next. E\r\nand Sloan were always one of the weaker subplots of the HBO show and nothing\r\nhas changed here. In better news, Johnny Drama (Kevin Dillon) gets to steal a\r\nfew scenes with a solid arc about his \u201cbaby bro\u201d\u2019s movie being the one that\r\nfinally gives him a break. Finally, Turtle (Jerry Ferrara), who seems to have\r\nmade a million dollars for every pound he\u2019s lost, which is quite a few, almost\r\nliterally runs into Ronda Rousey, and tries to start a relationship with her.  The VERY little tension of \u201cEntourage\u201d comes when the son of\r\nChase\u2019s main financier, played with smarm by Osment, reports back that he hates\r\nthe cut of \u201cHyde\u201d that he\u2019s seen, especially the four scenes that include\r\nJohnny Drama. Will Vinny cut out his brother and betray his vision to get the\r\nmovie done? Have you seen the show? At the end of HBO\u2019s \u201cEntourage,\u201d the characters were wildly\r\nsuccessful, rich and happy. Guess what? They still are! Rather than take any\r\nchances, Ellin barely wrote a plot for the \u201cEntourage\u201d movie, using his time\r\ninstead to call in celebrity cameos and think of the prettiest locations in\r\nwhich to shoot them. Most of the dialogue is forced and unnatural, especially\r\nin the Connolly/Chriqui and Ferrara/Rousey subplots, but that\u2019s because it\r\ndoesn\u2019t matter what people say in the world of \u201cEntourage.\u201d All that matters is\r\nwho they party with, who they sleep with, and how much money they make. And the\r\nfilm suffers greatly from a plague of TV-to-film adaptations in that it gets\r\nstrikingly repetitive given that the people behind it are used to writing\r\n30-minutes narratives and spin their wheels when they try to go feature-length.\r\nWithout Piven and Dillon to keep it entertaining, it would be absolutely\r\ndreadful.  \u201cEntourage\u201d ended in such a way that I don\u2019t think even\r\ndiehard fans of the HBO show were overly concerned about Vinny and the boys.\r\nThere were no loose ends to tie up. And, in that sense, \u201cEntourage\u201d feels like\r\nanother victory lap for characters who had already won the race of life.\r\nInstead of challenging his characters or giving them something new to do, Ellin\r\njust high fives them on the way to the winner\u2019s circle.", "Critic": "Beta"}
