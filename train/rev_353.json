{"Title": "Among Ravens", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "One can learn a good deal from watching \"Among Ravens.\"\r\nThose viewers keen on noting the passing of historical time will find out, if\r\nthey didn\u2019t know already, that the demographic sometimes known as \u201cGeneration\r\nX\u201d is now old enough to warrant its own \"The Big Chill\"-wannabe \u201cwhat happened to\r\nour values and aspirations\u201d movie. Viewers keen on birds will learn an awful\r\nlot from the movie\u2019s pivotal character, Chad, a self-described \u201cnature\r\nfilmmaker,\u201d a bit younger than most of the film\u2019s adult characters, who is\r\ndeposited into a group of pals chilling at a prime piece of real estate porn\r\nover a July 4 weekend, and who\u2014when he\u2019s not being kinda-sorta Asperger\u2019s ish\r\n(the character\u2019s symptoms, which are depicted in glossy movie generalized tics\r\nto begin with, are ultimately meant to signal a kind of mystic presence)\u2014drops\r\nsome choice morsels of science about our flying friends. Much of this\r\ninformation is intended to work as metaphor. As in \u201cif the baby bird is\r\nunfeathered, you can look for a nest\u2026and if you find it, you can bring it\r\nhome.\u201d  Advertisement The movie is also apt, though, to bring up some questions in\r\nthe mind of a viewer. I myself was kind of curious as to how, at a time when it\r\nseems so many of the best film directors are moving over to television because\r\nthe feature filmmaking process can\u2019t accommodate their artistic ambitions, this\r\npompous, know-something-ish, navel-gazing, indulgent, pissy, priggish, albeit\r\nreasonably well-photographed, pile of sick got financed to completion. Because\r\n\"Among Ravens\" is, finally, a thoroughly noxious concoction.  \u201cRavens were once among the most colorful of birds,\u201d begins\r\nthe narration from the young girl Joey (Johnny Sequoyah, the best performer in\r\nthe movie). Joey sees her extended family as raven-like. Her biological dad, a\r\nbest-selling author named Saul King, who refers to himself as \u201cThe King,\u201d lists\r\n\u201cAn Unkindness of Ravens\u201d as among his tomes. So the metaphors, you see, start\r\nhitting right off the bat, as the movie introduces a schlubby life-coach\r\ncharacter (Calum Grant)\u00a0 and his\r\nsuper-post-hippie-dippie teen girlfriend (Castille Landon, playing a terribly\r\nunappealing variant on the Meg Tilly character in \"The Big Chill\"), Joey\u2019s\r\nconflicted-about-being-bourgeois mom Wendy (Amy Smart), Wendy\u2019s\r\nstrapped-for-income but not-wanting-to-show it husband Ellis (Joshua Leonard),\r\nall bantering and trading success stories until oddball Chad (Will McCormack)\r\ncomes along.\u00a0The\r\nstranger-who-upends-the-lives-of-complacent-characters trope is one with long\r\ncinematic history, and as soon as you get a long look at McCormack\u2019s goofy mug\r\nyou hope this isn\u2019t going to be a \"Teorema\"-style seducing scenario. Thankfully,\r\nit is not. Chad shakes things up just by acting inappropriate (inappropriate\r\nenough that in a plausible scenario, Ellis would have been driving him to the\r\nnearest Super 8 about three minutes after Chad had showed up in his dining\r\nroom) and then being strangely \u201cwise,\u201d just like little Joey. The tyke has her\r\nbig moment of gravitas when, after her mom compares life to a garden and\r\nexplains that sometimes you need to pull out the weeds, she asks, \u201cWho decides\r\nwhat\u2019s a weed?\u201d  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
