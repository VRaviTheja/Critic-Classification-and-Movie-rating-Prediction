{"Title": "The Age of Shadows", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "If Kim Jee-woon\u2019s fantastically entertaining \u201cThe Good, the\r\nBad and the Weird\u201d saw the talented Korean director playing with the milieu of\r\nSergio Leone, his latest, the espionage thriller \u201cThe Age of Shadows,\u201d could be\r\ncategorized as a riff on the films of Carol Reed\u2014there\u2019s a lot of talk of\r\nloyalty to country and double agents working both sides against the middle, and even comes with an extended sequence aboard a train filled with spies. At\r\n140 minutes, Kim sometimes loses the rhythm of his spy thriller, but he's such\r\na confident filmmaker\u2014and his leading man such a magnetic presence\u2014that he\r\nquickly gets its back. \u201cThe Age of Shadows\u201d may not be among its filmmaker\u2019s best works (I\r\nadore \u201cGood,\u201d \u201cA Tale of Two Sisters,\u201d and the vicious \u201cI Saw the Devil\u201d) but\r\nit\u2019s not for lack of ambition or scope.  Advertisement \u201cThe Age of Shadows\u201d opens with a meeting between a fighter\r\nfor the Korean resistance against the Japanese occupation (the film takes place\r\nin 1920s Korea) and an antiques dealer. As the fighter is trying to sell an item\r\nto raise funds for the resistance, it becomes clear something is wrong.\r\nBefore you know it, dozens of police officers descend upon the place and a chase\r\nensues that sets the stage for the two hours to come, in that it\u2019s a situation\r\nthat looks horribly out of balance\u2014one man trying to escape an army. That army\r\nis led by Lee Jung-chool (the great Song Kang-Ho), who seems to be the only one\r\ntrying to take the target alive\u2014again setting up his character as someone stuck\r\nbetween immovable forces. After the freedom fighter is injured so badly that he\r\nliterally twists his own toe off, he kills himself. This will be a film about men willing to die for that which they believe in, and how impossible that kind of commitment can be to stop. Much like \u201cGood,\u201d \u201cThe Age of Shadows\u201d develops into a\r\nthree-character piece. There\u2019s Lee, the Korean captain working for the Japanese\r\npolice, who becomes sympathetic to the causes and the people behind the\r\nresistance he\u2019s been assigned to stopping; there\u2019s Kim Woo-jin (Gong Yoo,\r\nrecently seen in \u201cTrain to Busan\u201d), the new leader of the resistance; and there\u2019s\r\nthe Japanese agent Hashimoto (Um Tae-goo), who often looks like he\u2019d be willing\r\nto kill an entire train of people just to stop one resistance fighter. The fact\r\nthat Hashimoto and his vicious superior are sketched as near-sociopathic men,\r\nwilling to do whatever it takes to stop the insurgence, makes Lee\u2019s interest in\r\nthe other side believable. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the director gives Kim a minor\r\nlove story\u2014he\u2019s fallen hard for Yun Gye-Soon, the heroine of the resistance, played by Han\r\nJi-min\u2014thereby humanizing him even further. There is a lot of\r\ndiscussion of informants and double agents in \u201cThe Age of Shadows,\u201d to the\r\npoint that story often gets muddled and the actual stakes feel\r\nlessened. Kim works primarily in action outbursts\u2014a train centerpiece, the\r\nhighlight of the film, puts all the good guys and bad guys on board and then\r\nslow-burns to its explosive climax. By defining Lee\u2019s loyalties as seriously\r\nunclear at this point and then putting spies, police officers and a ton of\r\nexplosives on a train to Seoul, Kim\u2019s film justifies the cost of admission in\r\njust the train sequence alone. It\u2019s beautifully conceived, framed and executed.\r\nOutside of that, there are a few extended scenes, but calling this an action\r\nfilm would be misleading.  Advertisement While Kim\u2019s filmmaking is typically engaging, it\u2019s really\r\nSong Kang-ho who carries the viewer\u2019s interest. Gong Yoo may get the more traditional hero\r\nrole, but it\u2019s important to the director that we see this story through the eyes of\r\nthe man caught in the middle. The star of \u201cThirst\u201d and \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d is\r\ntypically fantastic, a man conflicted enough to question the role he\u2019ll play in\r\na formative chapter of his country\u2019s history. Everyone here is good, although I\r\ndo wish some of the supporting characters had been fleshed out a bit more. We\r\nknow almost nothing about Yun Gye-Soon outside of the love-struck\r\neyes given her by Kim Woo-jin and a visually striking sequence in the train\r\nstation. When her torture becomes a key, disturbing event in the final act, it\r\nlacks resonance because of how little we know about her. Although perhaps that\u2019s part of the point. None of these\r\npeople knew much about each other, or even themselves. \u201cThe Age of Shadows\u201d is\r\nabout a man caught between country and duty; decency and obligation. It is\r\nabout people in a time in which black and white lost their meaning, and everything\r\nblended to the gray of shadow.", "Critic": "Beta"}
