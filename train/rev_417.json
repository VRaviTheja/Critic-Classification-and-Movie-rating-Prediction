{"Title": "The Voices", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Ryan Reynolds is having a bit of a moment, even if too few\r\npeople are seeing it. Taken together, his work in Atom Egoyan\u2019s \u201cThe Captive,\u201d\r\nAnna Boden & Ryan Fleck\u2019s Sundance hit \u201cMississippi Grind\u201d and, releasing\r\nOn Demand and in limited theatrical release today, Marjane Satrapi\u2019s \u201cThe Voices,\u201d represent a renaissance for the actor, who is clearly taking roles that\r\ninterest him instead of the biggest paychecks or most likely shots at stardom.\r\nI\u2019ve always liked Reynolds for the most part, but he does his best work yet here in\r\nSatrapi\u2019s odd, pitch-black comedy about a man who talks to his dog and cat. And\r\nthey talk back. Advertisement The opening act of \u201cThe Voices\u201d has echoes of Joel and Ethan\r\nCoen\u2019s sarcastic looks at small town life as we meet the relentlessly upbeat\r\nJerry (Reynolds), a worker at a toy factory at which he must dress in pink\r\nevery day. He\u2019s as happy as they come, gleefully planning an office party and\r\nover the moon at the fact that it will include a conga line to \"Sing a Happy Song\" like a cheesy\r\nwedding. It\u2019s only when he returns to his rundown abode that his cat Mr.\r\nWhiskers sets him straight\u2014\u201cThe only\r\nreason they don\u2019t fire your ass is because you\u2019re so hopelessly pathetic you\r\namuse them.\u201d Like so many filmmakers before her, Satrapi is exploring the\r\ndark underbelly and murderous intent of even the most cheerful, seemingly happy\r\npeople in society.  Jerry needs to be on drugs to function normally. So says Dr.\r\nWarren (an underutilized Jacki Weaver), with whom he regularly meets. Without\r\nhis anti-psychotic medication, Jerry talks to his dog Bosco and his cat Mr.\r\nWhiskers (who are both perfectly voiced by Reynolds himself\u2026which makes a\r\ntwisted sense if you think about it). Bosco is the supportive angel to his loyal master\r\nwhile Mr. Whiskers is the devil on Jerry\u2019s shoulder, encouraging bad behavior\r\nand denigrating every attempt at normalcy.  Jerry acts on his romantic interest in a gorgeous co-worker named\r\nFiona (Gemma Arterton), asking her out for Chinese food. After she stands him\r\nup, he happens upon her in the road, offering her a ride home. A car crash\r\nleads to an accidental death, and before you know it Fiona\u2019s head is in Jerry\u2019s\r\nfridge. And it\u2019s still talking to him. Bosco tries to convince Jerry that he\u2019s\r\nstill a good guy but Fiona wants a friend in the lonely refrigerator. Mr.\r\nWhiskers thinks that\u2019s a grand idea. There\u2019s a great sequence about halfway through \u201cThe Voices\u201d\r\nin which Jerry gives in and takes his meds as ordered, waking up to a world\r\nthat he doesn\u2019t want to live in. He has no friends without the voices in his\r\nhead/pets. And the talking head of Fiona in his dementia is much more appealing\r\nthan the reality of a decomposing head in his refrigerator. \u201cThe Voices\u201d is the tale of a man who\r\ncan\u2019t look back, really since the death of his mother, or he\u2019ll really go insane. Once you start talking\r\nto your pets, there\u2019s no turning around. Advertisement And that\u2019s what Reynolds truly captures: the idea that Jerry\r\nis a man forced down a road of violence by things that he cannot control. He is\r\na unique serial killer in that he so wants normalcy, companionship and\r\nhappiness. The joy in Reynolds\u2019 eyes when he is shown human kindness by another\r\nco-worker (the always-great Anna Kendrick) is as key to this performance as the\r\ninsanity that other actors would have focused on and turned into scenery chewing. Reynolds\r\nuses his natural charm and good looks to great effect here. He\u2019s the boy next\r\ndoor; the smiling co-worker who\u2019s both easy to root for and remarkably annoying\r\nin the same breath. It may be hard to believe until you see it but this is a truly\r\nsubtle take on a man who has conversations with his pets. It\u2019s really great\r\nwork.", "Critic": "Beta"}
