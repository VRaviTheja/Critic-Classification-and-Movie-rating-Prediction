{"Title": "Power Rangers", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Loud, trashy, sweet and weird, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers reboot \u201cPower Rangers\u201d is not merely an ideal film for rambunctious and undemanding 12-year olds, it actually sees the world through their eyes.  In theory, the heroes are high school students. But they\u2019re actually a Disney Channel-styled fantasy of the splendors that await kids when they finally become full-fledged teenagers and can Do Whatever They Want. These heroes are misfits. They gather in detention in their high school, a scenario that promises to turn into \u201cThe Mighty Morphin Breakfast Club Rangers.\u201d Lo and behold, that\u2019s what you get: a mix of shenanigans, heart-to-heart talks and widescreen punch-outs between monster battles. Advertisement The team consists of Jason Scott (Dacre Montgomery), the future Red Ranger, a juvenile delinquent with a barely disguised noble streak; Kimberly Hart (Naomi Scott), aka Pink Ranger, a depressive who\u2019s in detention for texting an embarrassing private photo of a classmate; Billy Cranston (RJ Cyler), aka Blue Ranger, who\u2019s got a spectrum disorder in this version; Becky G as Trini, the soon-to-be Yellow Power Ranger, who stays a blank slate until the movie fills in her backstory during the second half; and Ludi Lin as Zack, the Black Ranger, who was African-American in the original TV series but has been cast as Asian here.  The teens are trained by Zordon (Bryan Cranston), sole survivor of a prehistoric battle that ended with a meteor wiping out the dinosaurs. He wants them to defend the Earth against his nemesis, Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks), by karate-kicking and body slamming Rita\u2019s beloved stone golems, then joining forces to defeat a gigantic golden warrior called Goldar.  There's a plot about the Rangers trying to protect a crystal hidden inside a Krispy Kreme donut shop, and a detailed mythology about the life force of planets, but while Rangers purists will appreciate the fine points, the film doesn't get too hung up on them. The best way to save humanity, Zordon explains, is to kill Rita. To drive this point home, the film repeats the phrase \u201ckill Rita\u201d so often and with such zeal that it becomes a shared joke between the movie and the audience. \u201cLet's go and do the one thing that's been asked of us and kill Rita!\" Jason exhorts his colleagues. \u201cI shall destroy Rita myself!\u201d Zordon proclaims when the training isn\u2019t going so well.  The \u201cstronger together\u201d message of the original show has been given a post-Obama makeover here, sometimes convincingly, other times awkwardly. The film\u2019s marketing hypes the fact that Trini has been re-imagined as the first openly gay superhero in movie history, and that is quite a milestone; but if you go out for popcorn in the scene where that\u2019s established you might not figure it out, unless you detect the undertones of Sapphic menace in the scene where Rita bullies Trini in her bedroom. (It\u2019s like when Paramount congratulated itself for making Sulu gay in \u201cStar Trek Beyond\u201d when all it did was give audiences a two-second glimpse of a photo revealing that Sulu's significant other was a man. Um, thanks?)  Advertisement Billy, however, becomes a genuinely memorable character, thanks mainly to Cyler\u2019s heartfelt performance (which overcomes a lot of fuzziness about what, exactly, the character\u2019s condition is). And the screenplay makes this cheerful kid the heart and soul of the group, and sometimes its comic relief, without sapping him of dignity.\u00a0Zack fares well, too: he loudly advertises himself as the \u201ccrazy\u201d one, but in private moments he cares for his sickly mother with the same grim matter-of-factness that the title character of \"Logan\" brought into Professor X\u2019s room along with meals and meds. (Zack and his mom speak Mandarin with English subtitles, a nice touch.) Writer John Gatins and director Dean Israelite make sure to take the characters\u2019 emotions seriously even as they celebrate the ridiculousness of everything else. Nailing the tone in a film like this is so important that if you manage it, the audience will forgive missteps. There are plenty here, including haphazard plotting, connect-the-dots characterizations, and nervous, jittery, over-edited filmmaking that only snaps into coherence during a handful of crisp action scenes (the best is an opening car chase done in a single take from inside a moving vehicle, \u00e0 la \u201cLet Me In\u201d and \u201cChildren of Men\u201d).  But every time your eyes are about to roll back into your head at the film\u2019s slovenly direction and editing, it\u2019ll throw in moments of pathos or images of eerie beauty (everything involving gold or water is aces). Or it will veer into three-hanky melodrama and inflict distress or bodily harm on a character you\u2019re surprised to realize you\u2019ve grown to like. The action is decent, occasionally splendid, near the end, although there are sure to be complaints that the movie takes too long to get the teens into their armor. It also hits too many overly familiar action film beats (including a side-by-side power walk), but if it hadn't, a lot of viewers would wonder why the filmmakers were stinting on the stuff they came to see (the power walk is pretty great).  Advertisement What stands out about the film\u2014and what consistently saves it, even when the direction is at its cruddiest\u2014is its sincerity. \u201cPower Rangers\u201d really does believe that people are stronger united than when they\u2019re going it alone, and it embeds that conviction into its action scenes. It also encourages its supporting players to cut loose and have fun, and boy, do they: Bill Hader\u2019s training robot is pleasingly droll. \u201cThis is the pit,\u201d he chirps, showing the heroes a pit full of dirt and rocks, then adds, \u201cIt\u2019s great, right?\u201d Banks\u2019 slinky performance seems modeled equally on Tim Curry\u2019s Dr. Frank-N-Furter and Sigourney Weaver as the demon-possessed Dana in the original \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d She walks with slightly wobbly confidence, like a society lady who\u2019s too old to be wearing such high heels. This is a film where a character's dad drives a pickup truck into the middle of a superhero battle to make sure his son is okay, and another character shouts \u201cI love my mom!\u201d so joyously that it echoes in the canyons. I\u2019ve seen complaints that \u201cPower Rangers\u201d is too crude in its humor, too precious in how it establishes its characters' outsider status, and too obvious about its product placement (the words \u201cKrispy Kreme\u201d  are spoken nearly as often as \u201ckill Rita\u201d). All three charges are true. But I'd also suggest that a viewer's level of offense will likely be proportionate to how  thoughtful they expected a film like this to be. The  Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is a subsidiary of Saban Entertainment, created to sell merchandise. It never had much artistic integrity to lose, so the  fact that this film actually has some is amazing. This big-budget teen fantasy is essentially an unauthorized \"Transformers\" movie that has a moral code and is suitable for kids, in stark contrast to the actual \"Transformers\" franchise, which has prided itself on being snide, leering and hateful. \"Power Rangers\" is earnest and it has a good heart. There should be more movies like it, only better-made.", "Critic": "Delta"}
