{"Title": "The Tale of The Princess Kaguya", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Now nearly 80 years old, the Japanese animation director\r\nIsao Takahata has ever forged his own path over the course a half-century of\r\nwork. A legendary perfectionist, the co-founder of Studio Ghibli (also the home\r\nof the great Hayao Miyazaki) has broken molds by, for example, creating an\r\nanimated feature completely lacking in any \u201cfantastic\u201d element, the tender 1991\r\n\u201cOnly Yesterday.\u201d His new film, his first in 14 years, is a staggering\r\nmasterpiece of animation based on a very old Japanese folk tale. \u201cThe Tale of The Princess Kaguya\u201d is both very simple and head-spinningly confounding, a thing\r\nof endless visual beauty that seems to partake in a kind of pictorial\r\nminimalism but finds staggering possibilities for beautiful variation within\r\nits ineluctable modality. It\u2019s a true work of art.  Advertisement The movie begins with a gruff bamboo cutter in a forest. The\r\ncolors are pastel and watercolor; the drawing resembles charcoal sketches.\r\nCutting away at bamboo, the farmer sees a shaft of light; then a plant yields a\r\ndoll-like creature that, once he spirits it off to his cabin to show his wife,\r\ntransforms into a human baby. Despite being in middle age, the wife discovers\r\nshe can feed the baby (the breastfeeding depictions are very matter-of-fact);\r\nthe little girl is growing at an accelerated rate. She soon starts playing with\r\nsome of the males who live in the neighboring area; they nickname her \u201cL\u2019il\r\nBamboo.\u201d The leader of the boys is the slightly older Sutemaru, and all seems\r\nright for L\u2019il Bamboo in the pastoral paradise where she runs and plays and\r\nlaughs and sings a song about the nature of all living beings, a song she can\u2019t\r\nremember having learned but which she\u2019s always known.  Her adoptive pop has other ideas, especially after \u201cthe\r\ngods,\u201d as he believes, bestow a lot of gold upon him; he goes and buys a castle\r\nin the capital, and venture to make the little girl into a genuine princess.\r\nL\u2019il Bamboo\u2019s heart breaks, but she wants to honor her father\u2019s wishes. Here\u2019s\r\nwhere the movie\u2019s story takes a rather infuriating turn. As the girl, soon\r\ngiven the name \u201cKaguya,\u201d is trained and then visited by a quintet of ostensibly\r\nnoble suitors, the story turns into a kind of nightmare of patriarchy. Kaguya,\r\nbright and talented and beautiful, suffers through multiple squelchings of her\r\nown desire, and then acquiesces to the venal wishes of the authority figures\r\nshe loves. The movie is so emotionally roiling because it, too, is of two\r\nminds. It wants Kaguya\u2019s unfettered spirit to have its way, but it also\r\nrecognizes the almost primordial obligation that binds us to family and\r\nconvention. Kaguya\u2019s got her oafish father\u2019s number, and when she stands up to\r\nhim it\u2019s thrilling: \u201cIf I see you in a courtier\u2019s cap I\u2019ll kill myself,\u201d she\r\ntells him calmly at one point. And the father\u2019s ignorance is startling: he\r\ntruly believes that what he\u2019s putting Kaguya through is for her own happiness,\r\nthat this status is something she covets as much as he. Things take an even\r\nmore jarring turn once Kaguya finds out just where she\u2019s from.  Even if you have trouble hooking into the scenario\u2019s\r\ncultural idiosyncrasies\u2014the concerns of this movie, while not \u201cJapanese\u201d in and\r\nof themselves, are addressed in a very specifically Japanese way\u2014every frame of\r\n\u201cPrincess Kaguya\u201d is astonishingly beautiful. What looks rather rudimentary at\r\nthe film\u2019s opening is revealed to have a depth that never stops yielding\r\nbeauty; check out the shadows that fall over the bamboo cutter as he runs from\r\nthe forest with his discovery cradled in his arms. The movement animation of\r\nthe baby \u201cL\u2019il Bamboo\u201d is some of the best depiction of infant development ever\r\nin any medium: so much study, care, and artistry. Creatures both found in\r\nnature (insects, birds) and not (storm clouds that become dragons) are drawn\r\nwith remarkable sensitivity.  I believe the movie is best experienced with its original\r\nJapanese-language soundtrack; its widest release, however, will be in an\r\nEnglish-language dub featuring James Caan voicing the bamboo-cutter, Mary\r\nSteenburgen as the wife, and Chloe Grace Moretz as Kaguya. Due to a screening\r\nsnafu I was able to experience about fifteen minutes of this version and can\r\nreport that it sounds as if these performers honor the material well, so either\r\nway, don\u2019t miss this if you are an animation fan.
