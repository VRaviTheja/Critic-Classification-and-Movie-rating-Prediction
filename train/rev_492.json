{"Title": "Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead: The Story of the National Lampoon", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "If you\u2019re a scholar of comedy, \u201cDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead:\r\nThe Story of the National Lampoon,\u201d a concise doc about the founding, life,\r\nthriving, and death of the '70s-defining satirical magazine, is likely a\r\nmust-see. It\u2019s an engaging and entertaining film, filled with funny anecdotes\r\nexpertly related. It contains some notable \u201cget\u201d interviews. The magazine\u2019s\r\nreticent co-founder, Henry Beard, the buttoned-down superego to his Wildman\r\ncohort Doug Kenney, appears on camera throughout, which was a surprise to me:\r\nBeard, while still an active writer and editor, has kept a downright reclusive\r\npublic profile in the years since the magazine folded.  Advertisement Of course, if you are a scholar of comedy, you probably\r\nalready own the coffee table book, edited by former Lampoon contributor Rick\r\nMeyerowitz, also called \u201cDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead,\u201d which tells the story of\r\nthe magazine and some of its most notorious staffers. That book also features\r\ngenerous samplings of the magazine\u2019s work, which the movie, directed by Douglas\r\nTirola, can only offer piecemeal, or mutated via animation, a very popular\r\ntactic in documentaries nowadays. What the movie offers that the book can\u2019t are\r\nexciting clips from the Lampoon\u2019s stage show, which featured performances by\r\nfuture screen comedy icons such as Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Christopher\r\nGuest, Gilda Radner, and many more. The movie does an excellent job of\r\nchronicling how those stage shows gave rise to \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which\r\ncreated a huge talent drain at the magazine, and how the film \u201cNational\r\nLampoon\u2019s Animal House,\u201d while a huge unexpected monster hit that vindicated the\r\ninsight of the magazine staffers who conceived it, also diffused the energies of\r\nsome of the magazine\u2019s visionaries.  These chronicles are interspersed with a lot of things you\r\nsee too much of these days in docs about cultural phenomenons: interviews with celebrities\r\nwho tell you why the cultural phenom under examination here was really\r\nimportant and stuff, animated recreations of particularly outrageous anecdotes, and poignancy. The story of Kenney, who died in a hiking accident in Hawaii in\r\n1980, is played out like something out of a Fitzgerald tale with longer hair,\r\nwhile the passing of anger-management failure Michael O\u2019Donoghue elicits a bit\r\nless in terms of warm sentiment.  As watchable as the movie is, it\u2019s an almost relentlessly incurious history. The founders of the\r\nmagazine, and its admirers, go on at some length about what outsiders Beard and Kenney were as they\r\ntried to pitch their spinoff of the Harvard Lampoon to Madison Avenue in the\r\nlate 1960s. Yes, you read that right: the Harvard Lampoon. No one can be\r\nbothered to point out that an \u201coutsider\u201d coming from Harvard is still, um,\r\ncoming from Harvard. The doc is similarly unconcerned with the fact that the\r\nmagazine was by and large not just a boy\u2019s club but also a white boy\u2019s club. It\u2019s not as if the Lampoon\r\ndidn\u2019t butt heads with feminist forces during its actual existence, and the\r\ncanard about women not being funny is far from dead. So it would have been nice\r\nto hear from, say, writer Anne Beatts about this, as entertaining as her\r\nanecdote \u00a0about getting into the mag by dint of having been a male staffer\u2019s\r\ngirlfriend. And while a few black performers are seen in stills from the\r\nLampoon\u2019s stage show, the overall aesthetic that comes across in the movie is\r\nso almost relentlessly white that one almost has to ask: could Beard, P.J.\r\nO\u2019Rourke, Sean Kelly, or any of these guys, even ever conceive of having an\r\nAfrican-American writer in on an edit meeting? Except nobody making this movie\r\ndid. Which, admittedly, doesn\u2019t amount to anything like a massive social\r\ninjustice, unless, maybe you stop for a minute and look hard at what the\r\nmagazine was satirizing.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
