{"Title": "Avengers: Age of Ultron", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "At\r\none point in \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" the hammer-swinging superhero Thor\r\n(Chris Hemsworth) tells the android villain Ultron (James Spader) that \u201cthere\u2019s\r\nno need to break anything.\u201d \u201cClearly you\u2019ve never made an omelet,\u201d Ultron\r\nreplies. It's nice when a movie hands you a metaphor like that. The second \u201cAvengers\u201d is a gigantic omelet combining everything in\r\nwriter-director Joss Whedon's refrigerator, pantry and spice rack, and dozens of\r\neggs are broken in its creation. This film about a team of good guys battling a brilliant, genocidal robot is bigger, louder and more disjointed than\r\nthe first \"Avengers\u201d\u2014which, like this new installment, was a crescendo\r\npicture, meant to merge strands from solo superhero movies within the Marvel\r\nUniverse. But it\u2019s also got more\r\npersonality\u2014specifically Whedon\u2019s\u2014than any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise. And in its growing pains you can see a future in which these\r\ncorporate movies might indeed be art, or at least unique expressions, rather\r\nthan monotonous quarterly displays of things crashing into other things, with splashes of personality designed to fool people into thinking they're not just widgets stamped out in Marvel's hit factory.  Advertisement You\r\nshouldn\u2019t go into it expecting a smooth ride, and you should know that there\r\nare basic ways in which it's not up to snuff. There's too much over-edited\r\n\"coverage\" by multiple cameras, as opposed to true direction with purpose\r\nand flair. (Marvel farms out the planning of its action scenes to second unit\r\ncrews and special effects artists long before the actors arrive on set, which\r\nmight account for the choppy, incoherent, \u201cjust get it done\u201d feeling of some early\r\nshowdowns.) It isn't until the final third that the movie's destructo-ramas\r\ndevelop personalities as distinctive as the film's dialogue scenes. Between Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert\r\nDowney, Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo),\r\nHawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Thor; a number of supporting and\r\ncameo players; and several new leads, including Ultron\u2019s henchpersons, the\r\ntwins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), there\r\nmight just be too many characters, even for a two-and-a-half-hour movie. (Whedon's pre-release cut came in at three-plus hours; could this be one of those rare cases where longer is better?) The film will do nothing to quell complaints that the superhero genre is sexist: Black Widow is involved in yet another relationship with a male Avenger and burdened with a tragic backstory equating motherhood with womanly fulfillment, and while Scarlet Witch has some pleasingly Carrie-like rampages, she isn't given enough to do. Still, given the band-of-heroes conceit and the mandate to serve as a high point in an\r\nongoing mega-narrative, it\u2019s hard to imagine \"Age of Ultron\" handily dispatching any\r\nof these problems. And as in the first \u201cAvengers,\u201d which was also overstuffed, Whedon manages to refine the main players\u2019 personalities and set them against\r\neach other, often in logistically complex conversations between five or more people: action scenes of a different sort.  Captain America and Tony Stark/Iron Man are at the heart of this one. They\u2019re always more intriguing\r\nwhen set against each other than when they\u2019re claiming the spotlight in their\r\nown movies, but Whedon, who also serves as a consultant and dialogue polisher\r\non other Marvel entries, has taken their conflict a step further by\r\ndrawing on events in \u201cIron Man 3\u201d and \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s Stark who creates the titular bad guy\u2014with the reluctant help of scientist\r\nand part-time Hulk Bruce Banner\u2014in response to trauma\r\nhe suffered while battling Thor\u2019s brother Loki and his extraterrestrial allies\r\nin the first \u201cAvengers.\u201d Ultron is supposed to serve as a Skynet-like artificial\r\nintelligence network that detects apocalyptic threats and swiftly destroys\r\nthem. Cap saw the horrific outgrowth of this mentality in the second \u201cCaptain\r\nAmerica,\" in which millions of alleged terrorists were nearly\u00a0 wiped out by S.H.I.E.L.D. in simultaneous extra-judicial assassinations. Cap is appalled both by the Ultron project itself and the fact that\r\nStark started it in secret because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to hear the \u2018man-is-not-meant-to-meddle\r\nmedley\u2019\u201d from his fellow Avengers. He was right to worry. Like many a sci-fi robot or Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the creature has\r\na different idea of what constitutes a threat (spoiler: it\u2019s us).  All of which makes \"Age of Ultron\" a metaphorical working-through of America's War on Terror, with Cap representing a principled, transparent\r\nmilitary, answering to civilian authority, and Stark as the more paternalistic\r\nmilitary-industrial response to 9/11 type threats, treating the masses as\r\nunruly kids who aren't allowed a voice on grounds that all they\u2019ll do is squabble\r\nand finger-point while the enemy-du-jour gathers strength. There are\r\naccusations of hypocrisy from both sides. Some of Whedon\u2019s dialogue has the\r\nsting of political satire: Cap warns Tony that \u201cevery time someone tries to win\r\na war before it starts, people die,\u201d a not-too-veiled slap at post-9/11\r\nAmerican foreign policy, while Ultron chides Cap as \u201cGod's righteous man, pretending you can live\r\nwithout a war,\u201d a comment that indicts the United States itself, if you read\r\nCap as a beefed-up Uncle Sam. Ultron, meanwhile, is another example of faith in\r\ntechnology run amok. He fancies himself a robot deity and creates other,\r\nsmaller robots in his own image (all of which speak in Spader\u2019s voice), but\r\nhe\u2019s the sadistic God of \u201cKing Lear,\u201d a wanton boy smiting flies for sport.  Advertisement For\r\nall its missteps, \"Age of Ultron\" is remarkable. If\r\nit\u2019s a failure, as many critics insist, it\u2019s a failure like Ang\r\nLee\u2019s \u201cHulk,\u201d \u201cSuperman Returns\u201d or \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises,\u201d which is to say\r\nthat it\u2019s much more distinctively personal than most of the superhero movies whose titles are synonyms for success. There are points where the movie evokes not other Marvel spectaculars, but\r\nWhedon TV series like \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and \u201cAngel,\u201d where the\r\nfun came from watching heroes and villains who were aware of themselves\r\nas heroes and villains work through psychological issues while trading screwball comedy dialogue along with body blows. In its lumpy-porridge way, this film makes a\r\nbetter case than any other Marvel picture for the notion that\r\nquarter-billion-dollar-budgeted, CGI-festooned slabs of multimedia synergy can be\r\nart, too, provided they're made by an artist with a vision, and said\r\nartist appears to be in control of at least part of the production. (I say \"part\" because Whedon is\r\non record suggesting that this movie\u2019s production broke his spirits; that could mean that\r\nwhat we\u2019re seeing onscreen is the best he can do, considering\r\nthat the true auteurs of the Marvel films are executive producer Kevin Feige and his marketing department.)  Amid\r\nthe usual quota of quips and lightning and robots and explosions are moments of\r\npathos, splendor, sentiment, and operatic horror. There\u2019s quotable dialogue,\r\ndelivered with the deadpan camaraderie of Howard Hawks (\"Bringing up\r\nBaby,\" \"Rio Bravo\u2019), and scenes that evoke earlier classics without feeling too obviously like homages. The interaction\r\nbetween Black Widow and her erstwhile sweetheart, Bruce Banner, channels King Kong: she interrupts his Hulk-outs by holding up a slender hand with slightly curved fingers, and after a moment's hesitation, the green giant reaches\r\nout in kind, like a curious ape touching his reflection in a fun-house\r\nmirror. A lyrical slow-motion set-piece sees the Avengers battling waves\r\nof Ultron\u2019s android minions in a ruined cathedral, like the Bishop gang \r\nfending\r\noff Mapache\u2019s army in \u201cThe Wild Bunch.\" The circling camera movements \r\nare echoed in the film's credits sequence, which visualizes the film's \r\nheroes and villains as figures in a classical sculpture: Marvel in \r\nmarble. The design touches are swell: Ultron might be the most\r\novertly Jack Kirby-esque apparition in any Marvel film, his expressive\r\nface comprised of thin, overlapping plates. Key lines tease out the superhero genre's kinship to horror. \"Maybe I am a monster,\" a character admits. \"I'm not sure that I would know if I were one.\" Conversations and monologues consider the relationship between chaos and control, creation and destruction that drives not just action cinema but life itself. \"When the universe starts to settle,\" Ultron says, \"God throws a stone at it.\" Most surprising and welcome of all is the way Whedon builds criticism of\r\n the superhero genre's disinterest in property destruction and civilian \r\ncasualties (displayed most callously in \"Man of Steel\") \r\ninto the plot. \"Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the \r\nworld and destroying it,\" Scarlet Witch chides. \"Where do you think he \r\ngets that?\"\u00a0  Advertisement It\r\nwould be silly to position Marvel or Whedon or their fan army as underdogs. Once a niche genre, superhero films are now practically the official culture of the United States, and this entry will make a fortune no matter what anyone says about it. Still, I\r\nhope that even as people buy tickets out of habit,\r\nthey'll see that there is, in fact, art happening on the screen, maybe for\r\nthe first time since Marvel's march through American cinema started. \"Age of Ultron\" proves that a movie with stealth fighter jets,\r\nlevitating cities and Hulk-on-robot fisticuffs can be as freewheeling as a no-budget indie. It's a shame to think that this film will be dog-piled for its imperfections rather than applauded for trying to prove\r\nthat a seemingly inflexible genre can bend into strange and surprising shapes.", "Critic": "Delta"}
