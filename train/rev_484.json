{"Title": "I Saw the Light", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Hank Williams was arguably the first modern superstar of\r\ncountry music. There\u2019s also a sense in which you could call him a rock star,\r\nand the sense is a tragic one: he died on the way to a gig, of heart failure,\r\nafter a short lifetime of not taking terribly good care of himself\u2014age 29. His\r\nsongs remain country standards and rightly so, but there\u2019s not much room for his\r\nhaunted persona in contemporary country. Williams\u2019 son, whose name you might be\r\nable to guess, projects a much hairier and more rambunctious model and is, as\r\nsuch, more of an influence. (\u201cYou Sure Hank Done It This Way?\u201d is the name of a\r\nrueful State-Of-Country song cut by Waylon Jennings. Back in 1975, for heaven\u2019s\r\nsake.) Advertisement \u201cI Saw The Light,\u201d written and directed by Marc Abraham, is\r\na never-less-than-handsomely-mounted film biography of Williams; the\r\nparticularly outstanding cinematography is by Dante Spinotti, the craftsman who\r\nalso shot the likes of \u201cHeat\u201d and \u201cL.A. Confidential.\u201d Williams is played by\r\nthe lanky, high-cheekboned British actor Tom Hiddleston, and he\u2019s a terrific\r\nphysical match for the man himself, who had a perpetual lean-and-hungry look.\r\nHiddleston\u2019s performance is a masterful one: understated, superbly modulated,\r\nempathetic. Hiddleston can also mimic Williams\u2019 yodel-inflected singing style,\r\nwhich brought the innovation of classic country warbler Jimmie Rodgers into a\r\nmore pop-friendly realm, with impressive accuracy. While Hiddleston\u2019s is the\r\nstandout performance, and why not, the rest of the cast is formidable: Elizabeth Olsen, Cherry Jones, Bradley Whitford, David Krumholtz and a host of\r\nothers do superb work in roles of spouse, mother, business associate, and so\r\non.  And yet the movie flounders. Williams was a serious\r\nalcoholic and eventually a pain pill addict; his relationships with women were\r\nhectic, to say the least; his massive talent was complemented in the negative\r\nby a substantial and ever-increasing lack of ability to show any kind of\r\nresponsibility. The messy specifics of Williams\u2019 adult life prove too\r\nintransigent for Abraham\u2019s abilities; the writer-director can\u2019t make coherent\r\nart out of them. The key conflict\u2014at least initially\u2014in Williams\u2019 first\r\nmarriage, to Olsen\u2019s Audrey Mae, has to do with her own singing ambitions.\r\nThey\u2019re strong, but her talent is not, and this makes for a series of\r\ndiscomfiting scenes. Abraham\u2019s everyone-has-their-reasons sense of balance may\r\nbe commendable on humanist grounds, and there\u2019s no compelling reason that\r\nAudrey Mae has to be the villain in the scenario, but there\u2019s no effective\r\ntension here; the drama is flat. Later in the film, when Williams\u2019 romantic\r\nimbroglios take on a nearly farcical pitch, he behaves with staggering\r\ncallousness to one of his girlfriends (Wrenn Schmidt's Bobbie Jett) and the movie can barely\r\nshrug its shoulders. Many opportunities for character illumination are fluffed.\r\nIn a meeting with Hollywood movie mogul Dore Schary, Williams arrogantly\r\nrefuses to take off his hat for the executive. The implication is that\r\nTinseltown\u2019s too phony for Williams. Mere minutes later, Hank is doing some\r\nvery cornball schtick with an overweight comic emcee on the Grand Ole Opry\r\nradio show. This suggests a dichotomy that might have been fruitfully explored.\r\nBut it is not.  There are moments. Williams\u2019 tetchiness with a New York\r\njournalist (Krumholtz) sticks to the ribs, as does a drunken freestyle courtesy\r\nof Williams\u2019 darkling alter ego Luke the Drifter. But in the end, \u201cI Saw The\r\nLight\u201d doesn\u2019t illuminate enough to show us an entirely compelling\r\nWilliams.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
