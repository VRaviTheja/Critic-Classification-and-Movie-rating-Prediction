{"Title": "Burying the Ex", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Nobody doubts that director Joe Dante, the eye and\r\nsensibility behind \u201cThe Howling,\u201d \u201cGremlins,\u201d \u201cInnerspace,\u201d and more, is a\r\ngenre master, a guy who can blend gory horror with mordant comedy with apparent\r\nease, who can bring a true Looney Tunes feel to live-action sci-fi and fantasy,\r\nand more. Even masters have their off days, however, and Dante\u2019s new picture,\r\n\u201cBurying The Ex,\u201d seems to have been made over the course of quite a few of\r\nthem. Scripted and co-produced by Alan Trezza, and admittedly shot on the cheap\r\nover what must have been a very punishing 20-day shoot, the picture has\r\nintermittent charm and very little flair. Its eagerness to ingratiate long-time\r\nhorror fans, what with its multiple references to obscure films and nods to\r\nspecialist publications such as Video Watchdog (and yes I am a proud\r\nsubscriber), actually gets a little irritating after a while. Yes, \u201cBurying The\r\nEx,\u201d I thought as I watched, I AM on your side conceptually already. Now could\r\nyou start being genuinely funny? Or scary? Or something?  Advertisement Anton Yelchin\u2019s Max is a horror geek who works at a\r\nmemorabilia shop and is hoping to start his own such emporium. His rather\r\nimprobable girlfriend Evelyn (Ashley Greene) is a prim (in every respect except\r\nsex-wise, which trait I guess is meant to register as \u201cquirky\u201d) eco-warrior who\r\nhas little patience for Max\u2019s enthusiasms or his ultra-loutish half-brother\r\nTravis. The whole Max-Travis dynamic is reminiscent of the male relationships\r\nin early Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg scripts such as \u201cSuperbad,\u201d only those works\r\nhad good jokes. Trezza\u2019s script teems with clumsy lines such as \u201cJust let me\r\nfinish up this blog\u201d (the character means \u201cblog post\u201d) and \u201cThat was\r\nfangtastic.\u201d And the Max/Evelyn relationship is reminiscent of \u201cKnocked Up,\u201d I\r\nguess, because the couple only ever has Bra Sex. Evelyn moves in and takes down\r\nall of Max\u2019s cherry Italian horror movie posters, while a local ice-cream shop\r\ngives Max a taste of alternate dating reality in the form of horror-movie\r\nloving Olivia (Alexandra Daddario). Also: a talisman at Max\u2019s shop puts,\r\napparently, some form of curse on Evelyn. So that when she\u2019s killed in a street\r\naccident, she doesn\u2019t stay dead. Hence the title.  Zombie Evelyn isn\u2019t like other zombies: she\u2019s fully\r\nfunctional, brain-wise, and weirdly for Max, just as frisky as she was when she\r\nhad a beating heart. She doesn\u2019t even look that bad\u2014not falling-off body parts,\r\nsome bruising around the face and neck and a generally hollowed-out thing going\r\non. \u201cYour girlfriend is so Goth,\u201d Olivia says to Max, not suspecting the\r\nbizarre love triangle she\u2019s walking into. That last line is about as close to a\r\ngood one-liner as the movie offers up, by the way. As for the zombie stuff,\r\nit\u2019s even less convincing and engaging as I\u2019m making it sound. I know that\r\nhorror movies, or horror comedies, aren\u2019t for people who like their film\r\nscenarios plausible, but \u201cBurying The Ex\u201d offers such a watered-down and\r\ninternally inconsistent idea of zombiedom that it makes any kind of willing\r\nsuspension of disbelief well nigh impossible. The material proves, I fear,\r\nintractable for director Dante, who shows a little verve in the last third,\r\nintercutting a new-love sequence with a bit of human-organ-eating on\r\nabandoned-for-the-evening Zombie Evelyn\u2019s part. Different strokes, as they say.\r\nPotentially tautological as this may seem I\u2019m not even sure I can, with good\r\nconscience, call this a film for Dante completists only. And I can only hope he\r\ngets a bigger budget and more time, and a better script, for whatever he does\r\nnext.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
