{"Title": "Being Evel", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Does the world really need another movie about Evel Knievel?\r\nWell it depends. The pioneering (in a sense) motorcycle daredevil has already\r\nbeen the subject of two fiction films\r\n(one in which he played himself, or \u201chimself\u201d), one self-produced documentary,\r\na good number of television specials and retrospectives. Knievel himself passed\r\naway in 2007\u2014not in any kind of stunt accident but rather from a pulmonary\r\nailment, exacerbated, reportedly, by Hepatitis C, which the performer likely\r\ncontracted from one of countless blood transfusions\u2014and the above-mentioned\r\nmovies have long been forgotten by all but the most dedicated cultists. Which\r\nis, in a way, too bad. The first fictional Knievel movie, in 1971, starred George\r\nHamilton as the cycle maniac and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Lolita, Sue Lyon, as his\r\nwife. 1977\u2019s \u201cViva Knievel,\u201d which featured\r\nthe man himself at the height of his hubris (he didn\u2019t cotton to having been\r\nplayed by Hamilton six years before) costarred Gene Kelly (!) and was directed\r\nby deft Hollywood journeyman Gordon Douglas. Given Knievel\u2019s general\r\ndisposition at the height of his fame, directing him is (to paraphrase Steve\r\nAlbini) a job I wouldn\u2019t wish on a dog I didn\u2019t like.  Advertisement Anyway. The point is that the phenomenon that was Evel\r\nKnievel\u2014and he was indeed a phenom\u2014doesn\u2019t get much recognition in contemporary\r\nculture, despite the fact that, as interview subject and co-producer of the\r\nmovie Johnny Knoxville notes early on, the guy kind of invented extreme sports.\r\nThis highly conventional, intermittently\r\nengaging example of the Entertainment Documentary (you know, the kind that\r\nlivens up its talking heads with rear-projected imagery behind them, and\r\nfeatures animated reenactments, that sort of thing) outlines how this cocky kid\r\nfrom Butte, Montana became a post P.T. Barnum icon by essentially risking\r\nsuicide every time he got on a chopper. Discovering early on that he was kind\r\nof thrill crazy, he started using his cycle to jump over cars without any kind\r\nof mathematical calculation or preparation. He just got the cars lined up, put\r\nup the ramps, and went. This method held for quite some time, up to his\r\nill-fated but fame-producing missed-it-by-that-much jump over the fountains of\r\nVegas\u2019 Caesar\u2019s Palace and beyond.  This haphazard approach led to spectacular successes and\r\nperhaps even more spectacular failures. The footage of his crash after clearing\r\nthe Vegas fountains was the most replayed clip of its time. Similarly\r\ncringe-inducing is a scene from earlier in his career, in which he tries to\r\njump over an oncoming cycle, misjudges the timing, and takes a horrific spill.\r\nThe guy had a capacity for physical punishment that was equal to if not greater\r\nthan his talent for self-promotion. The movie interviews dozens of sports and\r\nmedia figures, including the recently passed Frank Gifford, who interviewed\r\nKnievel frequently on \u201cWide World Of Sports,\u201d and they all have wild, hairy\r\nstories of Knievel\u2019s bravery and wiliness. There\u2019s also bracing period footage\r\nof Knievel being a scowling jackass at Snake River Canyon, the site of one of\r\nhis most poorly conceived stunts, in which he attempted to rocket over the\r\naforementioned geological gap after being thwarted for over a decade in his\r\nquest to jump something over the\r\nGrand Canyon.  The movie is certainly colorful\u2014this is a guy who, when he\r\nhad it made, lived VERY large, even if he continued on what seemed like a quest\r\nto break every bone in his body multiple times. And it tells, as it keeps\r\nreminding us, a very American story. For all that, though, it doesn\u2019t\r\nilluminate the guy\u2019s character beyond what\u2019s obvious. Nor does it bestow much\r\ndepth upon Knievel. No, he\u2019s not a monster on the level of Jack \u201cPal\u201d Smurch in\r\nJames Thurber\u2019s caustic short story \u201cThe Greatest Man In The World.\u201d Although\r\nhe\u2019s depicted as behaving pretty badly, particularly with respect to\r\nwomen-chasing, what he does isn\u2019t all that unusual in the annals of late 20th\u00a0Century rags-to-riches guys who become dickheads when they\u2019ve got some cash in\r\ntheir pockets. There is, finally, even\r\nin his most vividly temper-flaring moments, something of a cipher about him.\r\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the movie (competently directed by Daniel Junge, also\r\nof \u201cA LEGO Brickumentary\u201d) or if it\u2019s\r\nhim. Either way, it makes \u201cBeing Evel\u201d a less-than-exemplary rep rehabilitation\r\nproject. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
