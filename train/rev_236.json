{"Title": "My Name Is Emily", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Watching a film, or I should say successfully watching a film, usually requires a willed suspension of disbelief. I\u2019d say the same thing goes for making a film. In spite of technology that assists creative artists in getting more technically credible results with less work and for less money than in the past, making a film is still such an illogical process that successfully completing one requires a faith that passeth understanding.  \u201cMy Name Is Emily\u201d is in many respects an average and in several respects a kind of clich\u00e9d and frayed coming-of-age movie. The protagonist, Emily, kicks off the film by speaking to the audience, relating her quirky childhood as the only child of an eccentric academic who becomes a best-selling author and a mother who dies too soon. She repeats apercus from her dad along the lines of \u201cIf you hide from death, you hide from life\u201d and contributes cranky questions of her own to the narration like \u201cWhy do we smile in photographs?\u201d  Advertisement The best thing about Emily is that she\u2019s played by Evanna Lynch. Lynch, who played the charmingly abstracted Luna Lovegood in some of the Harry Potter pictures, has grown into a young woman who looks like a rougher-edged Saoirse Ronan, and she brings a gritty conviction to the antisocial tendencies that Emily cultivates after her beloved dad, played by Michael Smiley, is carted off to a lunatic asylum. Now with foster parents, she immediately alienates her new schoolteacher with a biographical approach to literary criticism, disclosing to her classmates that all that talk in Wordsworth about \u201csplendor in the grass\u201d is about sublimated sexual transgression and guilt. This and more put stars in the eyes of her handsome, upper-crust classmate Arden (George Webster). Emily couldn\u2019t be less interested. But then she does not receive her customary birthday card from dad, and Emily is forced to solicit her only potential friend on a mission to drive to the institution and confront the old man, and maybe even break him out of the joint. She calls on Arden at home just as he\u2019s getting a snootful from his awful dad, and before Arden can even say to dad \u201cNext time you hit me, you better knock me out,\u201d you\u2019re thinking \u201cRoad Trip!\u201d And off they go, abetted by a kindly grandma and her vintage auto (and its attendant eight-track player, and John Dankworth tape, even). Their exchanges, given Emily\u2019s emotional blockage, are predictably prickly. \u201cYou make me feel stupid,\u201d Arden helplessly protests to Emily at one point. \u201cSorry \u2026 \u201d Emily responds, \u201cthat\u2019s the nicest thing anyone\u2019s said to me.\u201d I guess the point where I lost patience with the movie was when the duo finally made it to the asylum, and Arden decided to distract the inmates by doing an amateur pyrotechnics show on the roof of the drab facility. Your mileage may vary.  What all this has to do with my ruminations at the beginning of the review is this: \u201cMy Name Is Emily\u201d was made under more-arduous-than-usual filmmaking circumstances. Its writer/director, Simon Fitzmaurice, is afflicted with motor neuron disease, a condition similar to ALS, which is famously suffered by physicist Stephen Hawking. Mr. Fitzmaurice is confined to a wheelchair and can write and communicate with the assistance of a computer that he interacts with via the movement of his eyes. So, for him to have completed this feature, almost a decade after a diagnosis that at the time had him living for only another four years, makes \u201cMy Name Is Emily\u201d a miracle in a way that most other movies aren\u2019t, even if you allow that all successfully completed movies are some kinds of miracles. It also means that if you\u2019re a human being you have a rooting interest in Mr. Fitzmaurice.\u00a0 Advertisement What\u2019s the line between \u201cI wish I liked this movie better?\u201d and \u201cI wish this movie was better?\u201d That\u2019s a knotty question. I will say that one aspect of this film for which I have unqualified enthusiasm is the way Mr. Fitzmaurice and his cinematographer Seamus Deasy shoot the various Irish locations, and how they place the characters therein; the effect is often beautifully picturesque without being in the least bit touristy. The sense of place is so palpable you can almost feel the raw wind going through the characters\u2019 hair in the seaside-set scenes. It represents the movie\u2019s most seductive achievement.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
