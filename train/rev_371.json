{"Title": "Gimme Danger", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In a sense, the weirdest thing about \u201cGimme Danger\u201d is how not weird it is. Its subject, James Osterberg, also known as Iggy Pop, also known as Iggy Stooge, is not just a rock and roll survivor (so to speak) of the first stripe. He\u2019s also, like it or not, one of the maverick eccentrics of the form and the lively arts in general. He\u2019s a rock classic, but if your idea of Classic Rock is Boston, he\u2019s also a major weirdo. Similarly, Jim Jarmusch, the director of this documentary, is a filmmaker whose work is arguably not inaccessible but whose aesthetic lies pretty far outside of what we know as the mainstream. \u201cGimme Danger\u201d is by far the most conventional film he\u2019s ever made. I think that\u2019s a very purposeful feature of the film.  Advertisement \u201cGimme Danger\u201d is subtitled \u201cStory of The Stooges\u201d and that\u2019s important\u2014the movie doesn\u2019t give much play to Iggy\u2019s long and varied solo career, which at many points was far more commercially successful than that of the band he co-founded and fronted in the late \u201860s. Jim Jarmusch has described it as a \u201clove letter\u201d to the Stooges, but it is also a kind of brief for the band. Its accessible form, in which the normally more minimalist Jarmusch resorts to a lot of the standard tropes of the contemporary documentary\u2014talking head style (more or less) interviews, far-reaching archival footage, even animated recreations of events described by the participants\u2014seems to me as an attempt to reach the skeptics in the audience, and convince them that Jarmusch may be right when he calls The Stooges \u201cThe greatest rock and roll band ever.\u201d  This viewer did not need much convincing, I admit. The 60's and 70's Stooges only pulled off one album that I would call \u201cperfect,\u201d which is 1970\u2019s \u201cFun House,\u201d and the reason I am able to call it perfect is that I have a higher tolerance for horrible noise (which is what that record\u2019s final cut \u201cL.A. Blues\u201d is mostly made of) than many others. Considered without \u201cL.A. Blues,\u201d though, \u201cFun House\u201d is such a tensile model of ultra-aggressive rock and roll as to be considered miraculous. How did they do it? Iggy has an interesting answer: having assembled the right three partners in musical crime\u2014brother Ron and Scott Asheton on guitar and drums respectively, with Dave Alexander on bass\u2014singer and rhythm technician (trained as a drummer, he collaborated with Scott on the group\u2019s beats) Iggy recalls, \u201cI just started jumping up and down like baboons do when they\u2019re about to fight,\u201d which provoked his bandmates into a sort of frenzy. And the rest is \u201cNow I Wanna Be Your Dog,\u201d and more.  Both Ron Asheton and Scott Asheton have died in recent years, but not before reuniting with Pop for a Stooges revival in the early 21st century. Jarmusch has been working on this project for some time, and so was fortunate enough to log good, informative interviews with the relatively taciturn Ashetons for the movie. They come across as salt-of-the-earth Ann Arbor guys. Ron explains his penchant for wearing Nazi regalia on stage in the early days by talking about his veteran dad\u2019s willy-nilly memorabilia collecting habits. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything political,\u201d he says, and probably was not, but it was still a crummy idea and Asheton seems to realize it while also believing it might not be very rock and roll to admit it. James Williamson, the \u201cRaw Power\u201d guitarist memorialized in Pop\u2019s solo song \u201cDum Dum Boys\u201d as the Stooge who\u2019s \u201cgone straight\u201d (and indeed he had a prosperous career in software development at Sony after he got out of music for a while), brings a somewhat more plainly objective perspective to bear when considering the drug-fueled anarchy of some Stooges gigs and tours. Pop himself recalls \u201cupsetting people wherever we went.\u201d In an often-seen clip from the Dinah Shore talk show of the \u201870s, he boasts, \u201cI think I helped wipe out the '60s.\u201d Advertisement And what a way to go. Jarmusch lays out the Stooges story in a coherent, linear fashion. Fans like myself won\u2019t necessarily learn a whole lot that\u2019s new, but it\u2019s salutary the way Pop pays respect to the black musicians he followed from Detroit to Chicago during the musical apprenticeship of his teens. Johnny Ramone rather controversially said that with the Ramones he wanted to create an aggressive rock form that was, among many other things, \u201cwhite,\u201d and cited The Stooges as a model in this respect. \u201cGimme Danger\u201d shows that Stooges music, like all rock, had deep roots in black music, albeit a black music that did not get heard much outside of certain regions of the country.  But of course it took the personalities and proclivities of the band members to make their new thing happen. Early champion Danny Fields cites their genius and \u201ctheir lack of professionalism\u201d\u2014talk about understatement\u2014as being so intertwined as to be inextricable. And yet from the expanding wreckage the Stooges left in their wake there was a good amount of great music and an even bigger amount of influence. The movie is frequently moving, particularly in its account of the alcohol-abetted death of bassist Alexander, and the almost phoenix-like rise of the reunited band in recent years. This is a history lesson that, conventional or not, rocks hard. It can\u2019t help it.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
