{"Title": "The Whole Truth", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "After the success of films like \u201cThe Firm\u201d and \u201cA Time to Kill\u201d in the mid-\u201890s, filmgoers were treated to dozens of Grisham wannabes, films that mimicked the hit author\u2019s legal prose, typically with a twist or two in the final act. Courtney Hunt\u2019s sterile and flat \u201cThe Whole Truth\u201d would have fit perfectly in this lackluster subgenre. Starring Keanu Reeves, Renee Zellweger, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Jim Belushi, almost the entirety of this courtroom drama takes place literally in a courtroom, and the whole thing has the energy of a basic cable TV show. Actually, that\u2019s not fair\u2014most of those have more to say and more of a visual language. Ultimately, there\u2019s nothing offensively bad here\u2014other than a waste of talent who should be doing better work\u2014but it\u2019s so forgettable that you\u2019ll have trouble remembering if you saw it or not when you scroll past it on cable in a few months. Advertisement \u201cThe Whole Truth\u201d opens in the courtroom in which most of the film will take place. We meet an attorney named Ramsey (Reeves), defending an old family friend named Mike (Gabriel Basso), who has been accused of murdering his father Boone (Belushi). When the police arrived on the scene, Mike was crouching over his father\u2019s body, there\u2019s a palm print on the knife that looks like his, and he arguably made a confession. He\u2019s been silent ever since. Zellweger plays Mike\u2019s mother; Mbatha-Raw gets a totally thankless role as Ramsey\u2019s co-counsel. Over the course of the trial, we learn about the dark side of Boone, a man who could be abusive with both his wife and son. Did Mike finally have enough of his abuse? Did he kill his father to protect his mother? Ramsey has no idea because Mike hasn\u2019t said a word about what happened that day. It\u2019s hinted at early on that Mike had an obsession with crime-solving, planting the seed that perhaps there\u2019s more going on than we may expect. And then the film employs a flashback structure that kind of becomes its trick. Ramsey tells us in overwritten narration\u2014and to his co-counsel\u2014that every witness lies. So we see witness testimony that either omits something or flat-out lies, and then we see the truth through flashback. Of course, it all culminates in several final act twists, the last of which makes almost no sense at all. \u201cThe Whole Truth\u201d is filled with lines out of the Grisham playbook (like \u201cThey don\u2019t teach this in law school\u201d) and your enjoyment may come down to how much you\u2019re willing to forgive for the sake of a legal mystery. There\u2019s a whole genre of mass-market paperbacks\u2014I used to call them \u201cairport books\u201d\u2014that work perfectly on a beach or a long flight, when one\u2019s bullshit detector somehow becomes dulled. The script for \u201cThe Whole Truth\u201d is an \u201cairport book,\u201d although it contains even less sizzle and grit than most of those. It's by-the-numbers. Advertisement What\u2019s most surprising about \u201cThe Whole Truth\u201d is that it was helmed by Courtney Hunt, who directed Melissa Leo to an Oscar nomination for \u201cFrozen River\u201d in her debut. Since then, she\u2019s been working in television, including HBO\u2019s \u201cIn Treatment\u201d and, perhaps noteworthy here, NBC\u2019s \u201cLaw & Order: SVU.\u201d If you put \u201cFrozen River,\u201d with its deep character work and excellent use of setting, next to \u201cThe Whole Truth,\u201d I don\u2019t think many people would think they were directed by the same filmmaker. One can only assume that this was a for-hire gig. Maybe it was part of her \u201cSVU\u201d contractual obligation. How she got involved in such a lackluster production is what I'd really like to know the truth behind.", "Critic": "Beta"}
