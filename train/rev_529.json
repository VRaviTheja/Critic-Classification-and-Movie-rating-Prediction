{"Title": "Good Time", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "There\u2019s a hum to the night of major cities. It\u2019s the sound of unceasing traffic, neon lights buzzing, televisions on in every apartment, and more, and it creates a unique energy that you don\u2019t find outside of places like New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, etc. It\u2019s the kind of anxious energy that comes with a lack of sleep\u2014paranoid and twitchy. That hum pervades the Safdie brothers\u2019 excellent \u201cGood Time,\u201d a film that reminds me of great \u201ccity movies\u201d of the \u201870s like \u201cMean Streets\u201d and \u201cDog Day Afternoon.\u201d With a central performance from Robert Pattinson that feels like a direct descendant of Al Pacino\u2019s in that Lumet film, \u201cGood Time\u201d is a movie that can\u2019t sit still, and I mean that in the best possible way. There\u2019s a palpable sense of anxiety and panic that comes through in every heated frame after the film\u2019s inciting incident. It\u2019s one of those rare movies that makes you feel edgy, conveying its protagonist\u2019s dilemma in ways that prey on your nerves and emotions more than just relaying a night-from-hell anecdote. Advertisement \u201cGood Time\u201d opens with one of its only relatively sedate scenes (although even it is filmed in such a way that it feels tense). Nick Nikas (the film\u2019s co-director Ben Safdie) sits uncomfortably in a court-ordered therapy session. Through the exchange with his doctor (Peter Verby), we learn that Nick was violent with his grandmother, and that he\u2019s mentally handicapped enough to not fully understand how to control his anger or the social repercussions of his actions. Just as the therapist is getting somewhere, Nick\u2019s brother Connie (Pattinson) bursts in and takes Nick out of the room. Connie thinks he\u2019s doing good by protecting his brother\u2014of course, he is not. And this will be a theme of the night ahead of Connie, one in which he\u2019ll constantly try to fix a situation but only make it worse. The movie proper opens with a bank robbery. Nick and Connie want $65,000 from a bank and appear to get away with it before a dye pack covers them, and their payload, in bright red dye. Nick gets nabbed by the cops, sending him to Rikers Island. Too much of the robbery money is ruined to make his bail, so Connie needs to come up with $10k as quickly as possible to get him out. He starts with his girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and, well, things get crazier from there in ways that I wouldn\u2019t dare spoil.  Working again with the great cinematographer Sean Price Williams (who shot the Safdies\u2019 \u201cHeaven Knows What,\u201d Alex Ross Perry\u2019s \u201cQueen of Earth,\u201d and others), the Safdies give \u201cGood Time\u201d a claustrophobic energy that\u2019s hard to fully convey in a review. It\u2019s accomplished through intense close-ups and a style that could be called jittery but never calls too much attention to itself. It\u2019s a visual language designed to enhance the enhance the mood of its leading man without distracting from it, and it works remarkably with an assist by a pulsing score from Daniel Lopatin.  Advertisement Having said that, most of what shines so well about \u201cGood Time\u201d can be traced back to Robert Pattinson\u2019s performance, the best of an already-impressive career. He is impossible to ignore from his very first scene, expressing Connie\u2019s ability to only keep digging himself deeper and deeper into trouble. Connie makes choices instantly, and one gets the impression that it\u2019s an instinctual ability that has helped him at times but will only prove his downfall on this particular night. \u201cGood Time\u201d is essentially one long chase movie\u2014the story of a man trying to evade capture for a bank robbery and get his brother out of the predicament into which he threw him\u2014and Pattinson perfectly conveys the nervous energy of being essentially hunted by your own bad decisions without ever feeling like he\u2019s chewing scenery. Like Pacino in the \u201870s, there\u2019s something in the eyes and the body language, an unease about what\u2019s going to happen next, an inability to sit down. It is a stunning performance, and one of the best of 2017 by far. By and large, films are passive experiences. We sit in the dark and allow stories to play out in front of us, behind the safety of the movie screen. Movies like \u201cGood Time\u201d that break down that comfort and make us as edgy as their protagonists are rare and should be embraced. They give us the characters that stand the test of time and, as with \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d people keep discussing four decades after their release. Connie Nikas is one of those characters.", "Critic": "Beta"}
