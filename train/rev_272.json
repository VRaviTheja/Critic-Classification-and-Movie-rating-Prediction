{"Title": "A Merry Friggin' Christmas", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\" is being sold as a parting gift from its\r\n late co-star, Robin Williams, but it's a better example of Williams' \r\ntendency to enliven rather slapdash films by imbuing his characters with\r\n more sincerity and soul than they might have otherwise had.\u00a0 Williams\r\n has a small but colorful supporting part in this Yuletide-themed \r\ncomedy, which was directed by Tristam Shapeero from a screenplay by \r\nMichael Brown. He plays Mitch, the alcoholic patriarch of an extended \r\nfamily that he's been disappointing since the '70s. His son, a \r\ntight-sphinctered hedge fund manager named Boyd (Joel McHale of \r\n\"Community\"), is haunted by childhood memories of his father, a cynical,\r\n boozing crank. A recurring flashback finds drunk daddy telling little \r\nBoyd that there is no Santa, and that the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy \r\nand other childhood constructs are b.s. as well. \"The whole world is \r\nfull of lies, boy,\" Mitch slurs. \"The only road to heaven is to realize \r\nthere's no road to heaven.\"\u00a0 Advertisement As a grownup, Boyd overcompensates for his father's chaotic darkness, embracing an \r\nOzzie-and-Harriet idea of domestic stability in a marriage to Luann \r\n(Lauren Graham of \"Gilmore Girls,\" in a thankless reactive \r\npart), instituting a rules-and-nutrition obsessed lifestyle for his two \r\nkids Vera (Bebe Wood) and Douglas (Pierce Gagnon of \"Looper\"), and \r\nforsaking his childhood interest in bridge and painting for a boring but\r\n lucrative job in the financial services industry. And he's obsessed \r\nwith preserving his young son's illusion that there is in fact a Santa \r\nClaus. Wacky Christmas misadventures ensue when Boyd's PTSD-suffering brother, Nelson (Clark Duke), asks him to be \r\ngodfather to his new adopted baby, who's being christened on Christmas \r\nEve. This leads to a forced family reunion in Boyd's native Wisconsin, \r\nduring which we spend stressful quality time with Mitch, his \r\nlong-suffering wife Donna (Candice Bergen), and Boyd's stereotypical \r\nredneck sister (Wendy McClendon-Covey) and her no-account husband (Tim \r\nHeidecker), a convicted flasher and all-around pig. The\r\n above makes \"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\" sound like a bleak drama, a \r\nlow-key family dysfunction film along the lines of Jodie Foster's sly Thanksgiving staple \"Home for the Holidays,\" or maybe a \r\ncorrosive comedy of can-you-top-this outrageousness a la \"Bad Santa.\" \r\nUnfortunately, what we get is a patchwork combination of all those \r\nmodes, none of which manage to gel. There's a \r\nrunning joke involving a filthy, alcoholic, apparently homeless Santa \r\n(Oliver Platt), broad slapstick, a wacky-angry car chase, dumb jokes at \r\nthe expense of immigrant Mexicans and Afghanis, and lots of scenes in \r\nwhich characters scream tediously expository insults at each other, \r\npresumably to bully us into thinking that their dialogue is funny.\u00a0Then\r\n the film will switch gears and drop intriguing but regrettably \r\nunfocused hints that it has a deeper understanding of the human \r\npersonality and wants to say something honest about it. Advertisement The heart of \"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\" is the relationship between an alcoholic father and the\u00a0now-adult children he has traumatized and let down. (One of them has\u00a0erased Mitch\u00a0from a family picture: patricide by PhotoShop.) The gradually \r\nunfolding flashback that haunts the adult Boyd is a metaphor of sorts. \r\n\"Santa,\" the character, is a stand-in for our childhood illusions, or fantasies, about \r\nwhat life ought to be: the lies we tell each other and ourselves, and \r\nthat society tells us, about what constitutes an ideal family, an ideal \r\nmarriage, ideal parenting, and so forth\u2014and that gnawing emptiness that \r\nmany of us endure when reality doesn't live up to the hype. (By \r\nprotecting his son's illusion that there is a Santa Claus, the hero is \r\nalso protecting his son's illusion of his father as a perfect, caring, \r\nall-powerful patriarch: Father Christmas indeed.)\u00a0The\r\n tension between Boyd's wish that his father apologize and reform and \r\nMitch's inability to change\u2014i.e., between our parents as we wish they were, and as they are\u2014might have made for poignant, \r\nlow-key, observant human comedy. \u00a0 But that's not possible here, thanks to all \r\nthe forced, theoretically crowd-pleasing but actually tone-deaf clowning\r\n that drowns out intelligence and sincerity. There are a few\r\n nice moments of performance and filmmaking (including the elaborately \r\nchoreographed final shot), but not enough to redeem a film that seems to flinch from the harsh truths it was presumably created to address.", "Critic": "Delta"}
