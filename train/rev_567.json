{"Title": "Bite", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cBite\u201d is a low-budget body horror film complete with\r\nwarnings about having better friends and not marrying men you don\u2019t really\r\nlove. It\u2019s got echoes of \u201cThe Fly\u201d (and, more recently, \u201cContracted\u201d) embedded in\r\na story about a young woman scared of her future, until she doesn\u2019t really have\r\none anymore. At its best, and it gets pretty good after a really rocky start, \u201cBite\u201d\r\nis a clever gorefest with some creative twists and turns. It\u2019s one of those\r\nearly career horror entries in which the filmmakers don\u2019t quite nail the set-up\r\nor the landing, but the gooey center of the film works for those with a high\r\ntolerance for things that might make a majority of the population queasy. Advertisement Bride-to-be Casey (Elma Begovic) and her two friends Kirsten\r\n(Denise Yuen) and Jill (Annette Wozniak) are on a bachelorette party trip as\r\nthe film opens. Using found footage style, we see the girls on the beach, at\r\nclubs, in their rooms, etc. Clearly, Kirsten is the nicer of the two friends, while\r\nJill is a bit catty, and eager to film awkward, possibly even scandalous\r\nmoments. Right from the beginning, \u201cBite\u201d is drawn from the \u201ccautionary\u201d genre\r\nof horror films that teach us that if we would just never leave the safety of our\r\ncouches, everything would be OK. And if you\u2019re gonna be crazy enough to go all\r\nthe way out of the country for a bachelorette party, don\u2019t be stupid enough to\r\ngo off the beaten path. That\u2019s what the girls do one day, swimming in a\r\nbeautiful lagoon when Casey gets bit by something. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little bite,\u201d\r\nshe says. We know better. When Casey gets home, the poorly-drawn characters take\r\ncenter stage for almost long enough to sink the film. We meet Casey\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Jared\r\n(Jordan Gray), and her horrible soon-to-be mother-in-law (Lawrene Denkers).\r\nJared is the kind of two-dimensional character really designed purely as\r\nanother thing for Casey to worry about. When she returns from her trip, he\r\ngreets her with an antique high chair (he wants kids, she\u2019s not ready) and then\r\ngoes to work. The allegory of a young woman being pressured to have children by\r\na workaholic fianc\u00e9 with a horrible mother is so broad that it almost\r\napproaches parody, but not quite, so the film lingers in that in-between space for\r\na bit too long, in which we\u2019re not sure how seriously we\u2019re supposed to take\r\nthese caricatures. The acting in these early scenes is rough, and even the\r\nframing feels off. You can tell the filmmakers and performers are kind of\r\ntreading water until they get to the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d Any horror fan will tell\r\nyou, the set-up can often be more rewarding than the follow-through if it\u2019s\r\ndone well.  After the rocky first act, \u201cBite\u201d starts to find its\r\nfooting. The concept of pairing quarter-life crisis concerns with body horror\r\nstarts to click as Casey begins to notice the bite on her leg is, well, oozing\r\nand growing. There\u2019s also a bit of a sexual assault allegory in that we learn\r\nthat Casey woke up on the beach without her clothes or her engagement ring\r\nduring the trip, thinking that one of the guys she met there must have\r\nassaulted her. It's understandable that she\u2019s too traumatized and scared to respond to\r\nwhat\u2019s happening with her body. Advertisement And then \u201cBite\u201d gets crazy. Sure, there\u2019s vomiting pus, but as someone says in one of my favorite lines long after Casey\r\nhas gone full-Brundlefly, \u201cPeople always get sick after vacations.\u201d The movie\r\nclicks during a dream sequence of all things, as Casey is imagining a surprise\r\nparty of all of her friends shouting \u201cbabies, babies, babies\u201d as she gives birth\r\nto hundreds of insect eggs. It\u2019s a moment Cronenberg himself would have loved.\r\nAnd, from there, \u201cBite\u201d turns up the insanity. By the halfway point, Casey\u2019s\r\napartment is covered in egg sacs and her body is falling apart. And then people\r\ncome to check on her. The fact that anyone would walk into her cocoon-apartment\r\nand not just scream and run away stretches logic, although the film is arguably\r\nat its best when it embraces its own ridiculousness. At a certain point, it becomes clear that \u201cBite\u201d has\r\nbasically written itself into a corner, and it doesn\u2019t escape in a way\r\nthat really satisfies, but the bulk of the film is a creative, icky ride.", "Critic": "Beta"}
