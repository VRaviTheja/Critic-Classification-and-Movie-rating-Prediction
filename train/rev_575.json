{"Title": "In the Game", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Stan Mietus is the kind of role model that we all hope our\r\nchildren someday encounter in their lives. When we send our kids off to school\r\nor to athletic programs, we place an incredible amount of trust in the people\r\npaid to teach and coach them. Mietus understands, as clich\u00e9d as it sounds, that\r\nhe\u2019s teaching young people that it\u2019s really not whether you win or lose, but\r\nhow you play the game and how you respond to adversity that defines your\r\ncharacter. He\u2019s teaching teamwork, confidence, and, yes, that life is unfair.\r\nYou will lose in life, but it\u2019s how you respond that matters more than the\r\nlosing. Mietus is one of the central figures in Maria Finitzo\u2019s \u201cIn the Game,\u201d\r\npremiering at the Siskel Film Center tomorrow, August 22nd, with\r\nscreenings throughout the next week (go here for more details).\r\nIt\u2019s a project from Kartemquin Films, the brilliant people behind Steve James\u2019 \u201cLife\r\nItself,\u201d and the best sports documentary of all time, \u201cHoop Dreams.\u201d Much like\r\nthat film, Finitzo uses sports\u2014girls\u2019 soccer this time\u2014to comment on other\r\nissues, including income inequality and gender roles, but she does so with a\r\nlight tough, always keeping the focus on the players on the field more than the\r\nentire game.  Advertisement For four years, Finitzo and her crew went back to Kelly High\r\nSchool on Chicago\u2019s Southwest side, catching up with Mietus and the players on\r\nhis soccer team. The first of these young women we meet was up until 2am the\r\nnight before studying and woke at 4:30am for soccer practice, which takes place\r\nin the hall sometimes because there\u2019s not enough space in the gym and they don\u2019t\r\nhave a working field. It\u2019s a school that\u2019s 83% Latino and 86% below the poverty\r\nline. Over the course of \u201cIn the Game,\u201d we will watch young women forced to\r\nmake life\u2019s difficult decisions, often between school and work to help support\r\ntheir families. These are decisions made every day in major cities around the\r\nworld, and \u201cIn the Game\u201d is a stark reminder of how quickly life can force\r\nteenagers to become adults, especially when they don\u2019t have the luxury of\r\nmaking any other choice.  What\u2019s most fascinating about \u201cIn the Game,\u201d and it\u2019s\r\nremarkable how much Finitzo allows this element to unfold naturally and without\r\nunderlining, is that the young ladies that the film captures all have a\r\nstriking resilience about them. Some will be faced with tragedy. Some will be\r\nfaced with closed doors. Some will be faced with heartbreak. And yet they hold\r\ntheir heads up high and keep going in ways that I don\u2019t believe everyone\r\nwould. I think a lot of that credit can go back to Mietus and the fortitude one\r\ngains from team sports the way he teaches them. There are times in life when\r\nyour opponent will have more privilege, such as when Kelly plays Whitney Young,\r\none of the top soccer high schools in the country. They have no chance of\r\nwinning. And yet they play. They get out there. They work as a team. The idea\r\nthat we can persevere against a system that often stacks the deck against us is\r\nas important as any we can learn.  \u201cIn the Game\u201d doesn\u2019t position itself as a \u201cstatement film.\u201d\r\nThere are no statistics emblazoned on the screen. It is a study of one school athletic\r\nprogram and its players. And yet it feels more important than that. It feels\r\nempowering, even inspirational. You will lose some games. In life, you will play some\r\ngames that you never had a chance of winning. But the important thing is that\r\nyou keep playing.", "Critic": "Beta"}
