{"Title": "Phoenix", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "How do we process unimaginable betrayal? How do we overcome\r\nthe kind of events that forever alter the trajectory of a life we so\r\ndesperately want back? These are just two of the questions addressed by\r\nChristian Petzold\u2019s masterful \u201cPhoenix,\u201d a film that firmly cements its\r\ndirector as one of the most impressive working today. With echoes of \u201cVertigo,\u201d\r\nand a deeply confident visual language, Petzold\u2019s film resonates long after its\r\nperfect ending. This is a riveting piece of work that never loses sight of its\r\nhuman story while also serving as a commentary for how an entire country deals\r\nwith tragedies like war. A film this satisfying on every level\u2014one that can be\r\nenjoyed purely for its narrative while also providing material for hours of\r\ndiscussion on its themes\u2014is truly rare.  Advertisement \u201cPhoenix\u201d opens with a face profiled in darkness. It is the\r\nface of Lene (Nina Kunzendorf), a woman driving a bandaged and bloodied\r\npassenger back to Berlin. Her face has been badly damaged, but she is a\r\nsurvivor of a concentration camp. After a brief encounter at a checkpoint, the\r\npair drives further and headlights fill the screen before the title comes up.\r\nThis story will clearly be one of darkness to light, even if it\u2019s a light that\r\nsometimes blinds you. We learn that the passenger is Nelly Lenz (Petzold\u2019s\r\ncollaborator, Nina Hoss), a German-Jewish nightclub singer, who, from the\r\nappearance of photographs and discussions with friend Lene, had a happy life. She\r\nwas married to a handsome, confident man named Johnny (another Petzold regular,\r\nRonald Zehrfeld). On October 4th, Johnny was taken in for\r\nquestioning by the SS. Two days later, he was released, and Nelly was\r\ntransported to a concentration camp. Did Johnny betray his wife\u2019s Jewish\r\nbackground? Clearly. And yet Nelly refuses to believe it. She wants her old\r\nlife back. And that means denial that her husband was and is a self-serving\r\nmonster. After her plastic surgeon advises her that she can look like anyone\r\nand start a new life, she tells him, \u201cI\r\nwant to look exactly like I used to.\u201d She is defiantly, stubbornly in denial\r\nabout what has happened to her. Over Lene\u2019s objections, Nelly returns to Berlin, seeking out\r\nJohnny. She is a shattered woman in a city of rubble. She tells Lene, \u201cI no longer exist.\u201d The relationship,\r\nthe friends she now sees only in pictures, even the city she once lived in\u2014they\u2019re\r\nall gone. She finds some semblance of familiarity in Phoenix, the nightclub\r\nthat literally looks like an oasis in ruins. It\u2019s like a dream that people find\r\namidst the rubble of a bombed-out city. And that\u2019s where she finds Johnny. He\r\ngrabs her one night. He has a plan. He needs someone to pretend to be his dead\r\nwife, so he can claim her inheritance as there\u2019s no evidence that his wife is\r\ndead. \u201cYou have to play my wife.\u201d And\r\nthe parallels between \u201cPhoenix\u201d and \u201cVertigo\u201d come into strong focus as Johnny\r\nbegins to turn this woman he believes is a stranger into the wife he betrayed,\r\nand, in doing so, brings Nelly back to life. Every choice in \u201cPhoenix\u201d has been carefully considered and\r\nyet never in a way that it smothers the realism of the piece. It\u2019s a film that has a deep cinematic language that avoids calling attention to its\r\nstyle. Petzold\u2019s choices are subtle, from the way he frames the expressive\r\nfaces of his actors to the choice of \u201cNight and Day\u201d in a crucial club scene to a climactic conversation that takes place on a train track, so deeply symbolic of looking in one direction to the past and the other to the future (as well as carrying historical weight with the trains that took people like Nelly to concentration camps).\r\nDark and light, rising from the ashes, the overhead lighting or neon red of the\r\nPhoenix sign\u2014Petzold plays so subtly with visual expression of his themes that\r\nhe doesn\u2019t draw attention to them, just allows them to be the background to his\r\nhuman drama.  Advertisement And that human drama is where Nina Hoss takes center stage.\r\nWatch the scene in which she takes off her hat in a club after seeing Johnny\r\nwalk by for the first time. She calls his name, happily, even though she knows\r\nwhat he\u2019s done. It\u2019s a name she\u2019s called so many times before. He looks past\r\nher. Or maybe he looks at her and doesn\u2019t see her. She can\u2019t be there. His\r\nbrain can\u2019t even recognize the possibility that she would be. Hoss puts her\r\nhand to her mouth in horror. It\u2019s not Johnny\u2019s betrayal but Johnny\u2019s dismissal\r\nthat hurts her now. This walking embodiment of when things made sense can\u2019t see\r\nher anymore, and so when he gives her the chance to \u201cbecome Nelly\u201d again, she\r\ntakes it. At one point, Johnny asks Nelly to help craft a story about what he\r\nbelieves is her false narrative of her time in a concentration camp. Of course,\r\nthe story Nelly starts to tell is true. Hoss holds her hands to her face, shaky,\r\nunable to speak fluidly. And Johnny is equally uncomfortable. The fiction he\r\nbelieves he\u2019s creating and the reality they\u2019re both denying are starting to\r\nintersect. Hoss is simply amazing in this scene, and really throughout the film.\r\n To be fair, Zehrfeld is very good as well. Watch a moment in\r\nwhich he comes home to find Nelly in the right dress, made-up, and looking more\r\nlike Nelly of the past. Is that a moment of recognition on his face? Awareness\r\nof what he\u2019s done? No, it can\u2019t be. He can\u2019t be that person and she can\u2019t be\r\nalive. She's a ghost, a reminder of what he's done and what the entire world lost in WWII. If we're lucky, a few times a year we get as complete a package as \u201cPhoenix.\u201d\r\nWe get character studies with performances as strong as Hoss and Zehrfeld are\r\nhere every now and then, or we get auteur-driven films with complex visual choices and an emphasis on\r\nstyle. It\u2019s uncommon to see a film so balanced that it serves as a commentary\r\non the human need to deny war and betrayal while never losing sight of the\r\nstory of a pianist and nightclub singer in 1945 Berlin. \u201cPhoenix\u201d works on so many levels, it's the kind of piece that can be dissected and appreciated for decades. And I expect it will be.", "Critic": "Beta"}
