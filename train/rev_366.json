{"Title": "Mad Max: Fury Road", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "George Miller\u2019s \u201cMad Max\u201d films didn\u2019t just make Mel Gibson\r\na star\u2014they completely transformed post-apocalyptic entertainment with their\r\nvisceral stunt work and singular vision of an increasingly desperate future.\r\nThree decades after the last film, the oft-maligned \u201cMad Max Beyond\r\nThunderdome,\u201d Miller finally returns to this desolate landscape for the\r\nhighly-anticipated \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d recasting the title role in the\r\ngrizzled visage of Tom Hardy and upping the stakes with promises of vehicular\r\nmayhem on a level commensurate with what modern CGI audiences have come to\r\nexpect.  Advertisement From its very first scenes, \u201cFury Road\u201d vibrates with the\r\nenergy of a veteran filmmaker working at the top of his game, pushing us\r\nforward without the cheap special effects or paper-thin characters that have so\r\noften defined the modern summer blockbuster. Miller hasn\u2019t just returned with a\r\nnew installment in a money-making franchise. The man who re-wrote the rules of\r\nthe post-apocalyptic action genre has returned to show a generation of\r\nfilmmakers how they\u2019ve been stumbling in their attempts to follow in his\r\nfootsteps.  \u201cWho was more crazy?\r\nMe, or everyone else?\u201d In \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d Miller has pushed his\r\nGilliam-esque vision of a world gone mad to its logical extreme. No longer are\r\nthe people of Max Rockatansky\u2019s world merely scavengers for oil or power; they\r\nhave been transformed into creatures of circumstance, either left with one\r\ndefining need or left without any semblance of reason. \u201cFury Road\u201d is a violent\r\nfilm, but the violent acts in this world don\u2019t feel like arbitrary action\r\nbeats\u2014they emerge from a complete lack of other options or a firm sense of\r\nstraight-up insanity. Miller\u2019s new vision of Max isn\u2019t a warrior. Rather, he\u2019s\r\na man driven by the memories of past sins to do little more than survive. He\r\nwalks with the ghosts of those he couldn\u2019t save, and his traveling companions\r\nhave pushed him to the brink of sanity. While wandering at this edge, Max is kidnapped and transformed\r\ninto a literal blood bag for a feral warrior named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who\r\nserves the whims of his maniacal ruler, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who\r\nalso played the villain Toecutter in the original \u201cMad Max\u201d). From the start,\r\nMiller gives you no time to \u201cease\u201d into this world or the story he wants to\r\ntell. The frame rate is accelerated, the editing is hyperactive, the bad guy\r\nspeaks through a mask that makes half his dialogue indecipherable (shades of\r\nHardy\u2019s Bane from \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d), and the horrific visions of Miller\u2019s\r\ntwisted future come fast and furious. Immortan Joe is a barely-alive freak of\r\nnature, kept breathing by tubes connected to his face and served by similarly\r\ndisfigured half-humans with definitive names like Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones)\r\nand The People Eater (John Howard).  Advertisement One of Joe\u2019s most notable warriors is a powerful woman known\r\nas Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who, as the film opens, is leading a\r\nconvoy from Immortan Joe\u2019s citadel to the oil refinery Gastown when she\r\ndeviates off course. It turns out that Furiosa has kidnapped Joe\u2019s \u201cbreeders,\u201d\r\nthe women he keeps prisoner in an effort to create a male heir. She\u2019s taking\r\nthem to \u201cthe green place,\u201d to safety. Of\r\ncourse, Joe sends his men after Furiosa\u2014including Nux, to whom Max is still attached\u2014and\r\nthe rest of \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d consists of one long sustained chase across\r\nthe unforgiving desert. With the exception of one centerpiece of dialogue, the\r\nfilm takes place almost entirely on the move, speeding, chasing, bouncing, and\r\nexploding across Miller\u2019s scorched landscape. As a reflection of more desperate times, Miller has updated\r\nthe needs of his future world from commodities like oil to pure survival. Max\r\nhas been reimagined as a fighting, driving machine, a man who \u201cfinds his own\r\nway,\u201d moving forward in an attempt to outrun his ghosts. Nux is a brainwashed\r\ngoon, a man-creature who believes that he will die and be reborn after\r\nsacrificing himself for a trip to Valhalla. Max eventually steps into the role\r\nof the action hero, but, in one of his most daring moves, Miller gives the\r\nweight of the narrative to Furiosa, a woman who holds on to the only thing that\r\ncould possibly give her hope in this violent world\u2014the next generation. Theron\r\ndoes arguably the best work of her career here, artfully conveying the drive in\r\nFuriosa\u2019s soul in a way that fuels the entire film. She does more with a\r\nsearing stare or clenched jaw than most actresses could with a page of\r\ndialogue. And one shouldn\u2019t undervalue the empowerment message at the heart of\r\nthis film\u2014Eve Ensler, author of \u201cThe Vagina Monologues\u201d consulted with Miller\r\non the script\u2014which suggests that women, as the creators of new life, will,\r\ninherently, always be the gender that holds hardest onto hope for the future.\r\nFuriosa looks at the insanity of the male leadership around her and decides\r\nenough is enough. When one of Furiosa\u2019s wards goes into labor and still defends\r\nherself and her yet-to-be-born child (after being shot no less), it\u2019s hard not\r\nto see \u201cFury Road\u201d as an answer to the macho nonsense that so often defines the\r\naction genre.  But none of that should remotely imply that the action here\r\nis lost in the message. The pacing, the sound design, the editing, the music\r\n(courtesy of Junkie XL and some of Joe\u2019s freaks who play drums and electric\r\nguitars during the action), and even the emotional stakes are all so far above\r\naverage that they make just about any other car-chase movie look like a quaint\r\nSunday drive by comparison. The first chase in \u201cFury Road,\u201d as Joe\u2019s men catch\r\nup to Furiosa and her precious cargo, is one of the most remarkable action\r\nsequences in film history. And that\u2019s really just a warm-up. It\u2019s no\r\nexaggeration to say that, if you think something in \u201cFury Road\u201d is the most breathtaking\r\naction stunt you\u2019ve seen in years, you really need only wait a few minutes to\r\nsee something better. This is a movie where you keep thinking that its reached its\r\napex and then, inexplicably, that moment is left behind in the dust. Advertisement From the very beginning, Miller and his team do something\r\nthat so many other filmmakers fail to do\u2014they define the geography of their\r\naction. Rather than merely tossing the camera around in the vain hopes of\r\ncreating tension, they constantly give the viewer overhead shots and clear\r\nphysical dimensions of what\u2019s happening and where we\u2019re going. And then they\r\nblow it all up. There are dozens of crashes, explosions, and flying bodies in\r\n\u201cFury Road,\u201d and yet the piece never gets repetitive, especially as the\r\nemotional stakes increase with each sequence. Miller knows when to let the pace\r\ncoast when it needs to, which is rarely, and then he pushes the pedal down and\r\nplasters you to your seat.  \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d is an action film about redemption and\r\nrevolution. Never content to merely repeat what he\u2019s done before (even the\r\nfirst three \u201cMad Max\u201d have very distinct personalities), Miller has redefined his\r\nvision of the future yet again, vibrantly imagining a world in which men have become\r\nthe pawns of insane leaders and women hold fiercely onto the last vestiges of\r\nhope. \u201cFury Road\u201d would be remarkable enough as a pure technical\r\naccomplishment\u2014a film that laughs in the face of blockbuster CGI orgies with\r\nsome of the best editing and sound design the genre has ever seen\u2014and yet\r\nMiller reaches for something greater than technical prowess. He holds aloft the\r\naction template that he created with \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d and argues that\r\nHollywood shouldn\u2019t have been copying it for the past three decades, they\r\nshould have been building on it. \u201cFury Road\u201d is a challenge to a whole\r\ngeneration of action filmmakers, urging them to follow its audacious path into the\r\ngenre\u2019s future and, like Miller, try their hardest to create something new.", "Critic": "Beta"}
