{"Title": "Search Party", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "I\u2019ve always found something morbidly fascinating about\r\nwatching talented actors and actresses give their all to a project that doesn\u2019t deserve it. I start to try to figure out if and when they knew it was a\r\ndisaster. Was it during the extended \u201ckidney theft urban legend\u201d bit? Was it when\r\nthe director asked him to play a scene in which his tights get ripped off by a\r\nMexican woman calling herself Sarah McLachlan? Was it during the scene in which\r\na child falsely accuses them of molestation? When did these very funny and\r\nundeniably talented TV actors know that \u201cSearch Party\u201d was a disaster? Delayed\r\nalmost two full years since its original release date and now barely released after being out on DVD in Europe for over a year,\r\none gets the feeling that \u201cSearch Party\u201d wouldn\u2019t even be getting its minor\r\nrelease if stars T.J. Miller & Thomas Middleditch hadn\u2019t proved such\r\nresonant comic chemistry on HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d and the always funny Adam\r\nPally hadn\u2019t connected in films like last year\u2019s \u201cNight Owls\u201d and the upcoming\r\nSundance hit \u201cJoshy.\u201d Otherwise, I imagine \u201cSearch Party\u201d would have been\r\nburied in the failed comedy cemetery in which it belongs. Advertisement One can almost see the thinking process that led to \u201cSearch\r\nParty.\u201d Get a bunch of talented TV actors together, hire a director who has\r\nwritten buddy comedies (Scot Armstrong, who has a co-writing credit on \u201cThe Hangover, Part II\u201d and a story credit on \u201cOld School\u201d),\r\nand why not pick up Tim Orr, the cinematographer from \u201cPineapple Express\u201d for good\r\nmeasure? It will write itself! No, it won\u2019t. Nardo (Thomas Middleditch) is going to marry Tracy (Shannon\r\nWoodward of \u201cRaising Hope\u201d) but has a stoned conversation that leads buddy\r\nJason (T.J. Miller) to believe that he should put a stop to the wedding despite the\r\nmore reasonable Evan\u2019s (Adam Pally) protestations. (In \u201cHangover\u201d casting terms,\r\nMiddleditch ends up being the wacky Zach Galifianakis, Pally is undeniably the Ed Helms,\r\nand Miller is the reckless Bradley Cooper). When Jason breaks the wedding up, Tracy\r\ngoes on the honeymoon anyway, leading Nardo to try to follow her to Mexico. Before\r\nyou know it, Nardo is calling Jason & Evan because he\u2019s been carjacked,\r\nleft naked in a small Mexican border town. Ignoring the advice of his co-worker\r\nElizabeth (Alison Brie) and boss MacDonaldson (Lance Reddick), Evan gets\r\nessentially hijacked by Jason to help out the third spoke in their friendship\r\nwheel. Along the way, they run into Krysten Ritter (\u201cMarvel\u2019s Jessica Jones\u201d),\r\nJason Mantzoukas (\u201cThe League\u201d), Jon Glaser (\u201cParks and Recreation\u201d) and J.B.\r\nSmoove (\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d). I\u2019ve seen awards shows with less TV stars in\r\nthe room. And yet none of them are given anything interesting to do. Armstrong and co-writers Mike Gagerman & Andrew Waller keep\r\nthrowing their protagonists into increasingly bizarre situations in the hope\r\nsomething will register as funny. When the film gets to an EXTENDED bit that\r\nriffs on the kidney-stealing urban legend at the end of the first act, you can\r\njust watch all potential for it to become something interesting dissipate. (This\r\nis the point that most people will change the channel on cable.) It\u2019s the kind\r\nof script that features a grown man lying on the floor in a moment of\r\ndepression and saying \u201cI\u2019m a dirty cum rag,\u201d and can\u2019t go to Mexico without\r\nusing \u201cLa Bamba,\u201d \u201cLa Cucaracha\u201d and a man covered in cocaine\u2014in the same scene. It eventually devolves into one of\r\nthose weird, \u201cHuh?\u201d movies in that I never thought I\u2019d see J.B. Smoove lick\r\ncocaine off Thomas Middleditch\u2019s face or Jason Mantzoukas shoot an arrow into\r\nAdam Pally\u2019s ass. But there are a lot of things here I never thought I\u2019d see that\r\njust aren\u2019t funny. \u201cSearch Party\u201d is one of those stunning failures in relation to its cast's talent. To their credit, Middleditch and Pally\r\nare asked to do a lot of physical comedy by their director\u2014the \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d\r\nstar spends most of the movie butt-naked (that still above either photoshopped in the shorts or it was an alternate take for airplane and network TV versions that will never happen)\u2014and they\u2019re always game for\r\neverything, further proving their willingness to do whatever takes to get a\r\nlaugh. Miller, Ritter, Mantzoukas, Smoove, Brie\u2014I love this cast, even if I\r\nmost certainly do not love this movie. In that sense, \u201cSearch Party\u201d pays off\r\non my morbid fascination, proving that even if you invite a lot of\r\ntalented people to the set, the result won\u2019t work if you don\u2019t give them a way\r\nto show why they\u2019re considered talented.
