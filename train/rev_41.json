{"Title": "The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cWhat\u2019s the highest grossing Swedish movie of all time?\u201d you\r\nask. Wait, no, you didn\u2019t ask? Well, too bad. The highest grossing Swedish\r\nmovie of all time, apparently, is this one, new to U.S. release, and watching\r\nit, one can see why. The Swedish film industry is one of the oldest and most\r\nadvanced in the world\u2014during the teens and \u201820s of the 20th century,\r\nits output was absolutely on a par with what the greatest innovators of the\r\nU.S. and France were up to\u2014but it is often associated with a kind of dourness,\r\non account (somewhat unfairly) of Ingmar Bergman and his death-occupied allegories.\r\nEven Sweden\u2019s popular culture is pretty dark\u2014it\u2019s from this country that the\r\ndark thrillers of Steig Larsson hail. This movie, as it happens, is a comedy,\r\nbut it\u2019s a frequently grisly one, and one that makes rollicking fun of a lot of\r\ndark Swedish preoccupations.  Advertisement Its plot is very neatly summed up by its title, which was\r\nalso the title of the bestselling novel upon which it is based. The movie\r\nbegins with a dynamite fuse crackling through the opening credits; then, its\r\naged hero, Allan, puts his cat Molotov outside for a bit, and the poor kitty is\r\nkilled by a coyote. Allan takes his revenge by blowing up the offending\r\ncreature. This action lands him in a nursing home, out of whose window he\r\nclimbs on his 100th birthday. The nursing home staff never finds him\r\n(that\u2019s not really a spoiler), but we follow him on his subsequent adventure,\r\nwhich is intercut with his narration and flashbacks of his picaresque 100-year\r\nlife.  \u201cAll I ever want to do is eat, sleep, and blow things up,\u201d\r\nAllan avers at one point. A cruelty inflicted on him in childhood precludes (or\r\nat least inhibits) romance, leaving him with those three easy-to-fulfill\r\ndesires. The blowing-things-up part is part of what gave this story particular\r\nappeal to Swedes. Sweden was, of course, the home of Alfred Nobel, the inventor\r\nof dynamite whose subsequent guilt about it led to the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nSweden\u2019s national character, apparently, is at least partially defined by the\r\nparadox that this peace-loving, ostensibly \u201cprogressive\u201d country is most\r\nnotable in 20th-century world-historical terms for advancing the\r\nscience of explosives. And so we see Allan cavorting through the century,\r\nblissfully free of ideology or perspective\u2014a more well-spoken, self-aware Forrest Gump, if you please\u2014encountering the likes of Franco and Oppenheimer\r\nand Stalin, and just happy to make things go boom the whole while. In the\r\npresent day, he stumbles upon a suitcase full of cash, makes an accomplice of a\r\nrascally railway station agent, helps rescue a circus elephant, and more, all\r\nwhile thoroughly flummoxing a motorcycle gang who want the cash and the\r\nextremely understaffed and indolent police force that\u2019s pursuing him. That last\r\nelement is a bit of a subtle counter to the depiction of Swedish cops in the\r\naforementioned Steig Larsson books.  Still you don\u2019t have to be Swedish to enjoy the film. The\r\npicaresque mode is one that\u2019s well-liked throughout Western culture, and this\r\nmovie, directed by Felix Herngren and starring popular Swedish comedian Robert\r\nGustaffson, executes it reasonably well, with touches not just reminiscent of\r\n\u201cGump\u201d but of \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d and other popular tall tales of our\r\ntime. It is ever so slightly more cynical and in-your-face with mordant humor\r\nthan a mainstream American film would have been; the insouciant treatment of\r\nAllan\u2019s first experiment with dynamite is more Adam Rifkin than Robert\r\nZemeckis. Such slight tonal eccentricities didn\u2019t quite do the trick for this\r\nreviewer, however.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
