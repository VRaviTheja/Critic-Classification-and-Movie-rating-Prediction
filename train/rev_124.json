{"Title": "Starred Up", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "From the very first shot, there\u2019s tension humming underneath\r\nthe phenomenal \u201cStarred Up\u201d that only intensifies as the characters deepen. The\r\nopening shot is shaky, reflecting both movement and the disorientation that\r\ncomes with change. And the eyes of Jack O\u2019Connell, a future star if ever I\u2019ve\r\nseen one, are tight and coiled, first looking down to gather his thoughts and\r\nthen glaring up at the unknown future of his destination. We see this young man\r\ngoing through the process of moving from juvenile care to being admitted to an\r\nadult prison, and it ends with his hands on his head and face. From there, in a\r\nnew cell he\u2019ll occupy for what feels like a long time, he does push-ups, he\r\ncrafts a shiv, he paces like a caged animal\u2014all before a single line of\r\ndialogue. Director David Mackenzie trusts his actor and O\u2019Connell puts more\r\nperformance up there on the screen in body language than most performers do\r\nwith an entire script. It\u2019s almost ten minutes before he speaks (and even that,\r\nto be fair, is so heavily accented and mumbled that I\u2019m not sure I could tell\r\nyou what he says), but we know Eric already through visual composition,\r\nphysical performance, and the other tools that average films often ignore in\r\nfavor of over-expository dialogue and false declarations of emotion. \u201cStarred\r\nUp\u201d is not an average film. Advertisement It\u2019s hard to describe \u201cStarred Up\u201d without making it sound\r\ngeneric. It\u2019s another prison drama, a genre that felt exhausted many, many\r\nyears ago. And it\u2019s another tale of a genetic predisposition for violence as we\r\nsoon learn that Eric\u2019s father Neville (the great Ben Mendelsohn of \u201cThe Place\r\nBeyond the Pines\u201d and \u201cAnimal Kingdom\u201d) is in the same prison as his son.\r\nNeville first spies Eric across the yard and glares him down in the way a\r\ndisappointed parent does before a beating. Eric has been thrown into an ultra-violent,\r\nalpha male world, and it\u2019s not one where having your father around is\r\nnecessarily a good thing. Human connection, for both of these men, will prove\r\nto be a double-edged sword. In many ways, it\u2019s a work about a father\u2019s anger\r\nthat both protects and derails his son.  Eric will have another father figure in his life, a group\r\ntherapist named Oliver (Rupert Friend), who convinces the prison Governor (Sam\r\nSpruell) to give the young man a chance at rehabilitation after a particularly\r\nviolent incident. In group sessions that almost always end in outbursts and\r\nviolence, Oliver does his best to try a different parental tactic with Eric.\r\nThere\u2019s a defining scene in which Eric flouts authority by lighting up a\r\ncigarette in group and Oliver tries discipline\u2014verbal admonition and\r\nessentially putting the group in a \u201ctime out\u201d\u2014before Neville bursts in with the\r\nphysical response: \u201cProblem is you\u2019ve got\r\nto come down on him full throttle; else it won\u2019t register.\u201d It\u2019s corporal\r\npunishment versus detention even in the prison system. The dynamic between a\r\nbiological father and a father figure behind bars is fascinating; both men try\r\nto protect him and both simply cannot in this kind of world. While all of that subtext makes \u201cStarred Up\u201d fascinating, it\r\nis primarily a character piece for the young Mr. O\u2019Connell, an actor who\r\nreminds one of Tom Hardy in \u201cBronson\u201d or the early work of Ryan Gosling in his\r\nfearlessness. There\u2019s a scene early on in which Eric knows the guards are\r\ncoming for him. He races back to his cell, pours oil on the floor, and then\r\ndouses himself in the stuff too. It\u2019ll make it harder to take him down. And he\r\ngrabs a couple of wooden planks for good measure. He\u2019s not getting \u201cout.\u201d They\r\nhave nightsticks, helmets and shields. But he\u2019ll do some damage on his way\r\ndown. \u201cStarred Up\u201d is a film about someone sliding out of society, and kicking,\r\nscreaming and punching as he does so. And O\u2019Connell captures that in a way that\r\nso many more experienced, well-known actors would miss. It\u2019s in the incredible\r\nphysical balance between prison-earned toughness and youth. There\u2019s just a hint of fear in O\u2019Connell\u2019s\r\neyes, reminding us that he was just a kid not that long ago. O\u2019Connell\u2019s\r\nperformance is matched but never upstaged by the increasingly fantastic Ben\r\nMendelsohn, an even more blatantly conflicted blend of rage and familial concern,\r\nand Rupert Friend. Advertisement \u201cStarred Up\u201d is HEAVY with slang and accents. You won\u2019t\r\nunderstand a third of it. But there\u2019s so much going on in between the lines of\r\ndialogue that you won\u2019t care. We\u2019ve seen many visually arresting films in\r\nrecent years and character studies are as common as film festivals, but it\u2019s\r\nthe remarkable blend of the two here that makes \u201cStarred Up\u201d devastating. From Mackenzie\u2019s\r\ncamera choices\u2014often tracking in one shot from relative calm like inmates\r\nplaying ping pong to an outburst in the distance down the hall\u2014to the sound\r\ndesign of clanking metal doors and distant cries, \u201cStarred Up\u201d is a technical achievement\r\nanchored by the clarity of character in O\u2019Connell\u2019s performance. It\u2019s\r\nfantastic.", "Critic": "Beta"}
