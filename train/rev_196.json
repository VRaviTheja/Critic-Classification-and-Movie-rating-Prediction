{"Title": "I Origins", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cIf scientific\r\nanalysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be\r\nfalse, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims.\u201d\u2014Dalai\r\nLama XIV The conflict between science and religion, fact and faith\r\nhas been a starting point for great fiction for centuries. Mike Cahill, the\r\nwriter/director of \u201cAnother Earth\u201d and \u201cI Origins,\u201d is fascinated with where\r\nthese seemingly diametrically opposed viewpoints conflict or, more\r\ninterestingly, intersect. Can we be scientific and faithful? Can we believe in\r\nforces beyond our control even as we live in a world increasingly fascinated\r\nwith explaining how everything works? With \u201cI Origins,\u201d Cahill takes this\r\ninternal conflict common in so many people and pegs something of a Puzzle Movie\r\non to it as one science-minded man experiences that which he cannot explain\r\nwith traditional reason. It is a film that can sometimes frustrate in its supporting characters\u00a0but Cahill\r\nand his talented cast are unapologetically willing to explore the kind of\r\ncomplex intangibles that filmmakers often ignore or merely turn into\r\npretentious drivel.  Advertisement Dr. Ian Grey (Michael Pitt) is obsessed with the human eye,\r\none of the elements of biology that makes us unique and that religions around\r\nthe world have used as proof of the Divine Creator. We all have eye biometrics\r\nthat are specific to us, and various cultures have viewed the eye as a window\r\nto the soul or even the thumbprint of a creator. Grey wants to get to the\r\nbottom of the evolution of the eye, working with colleagues Kenny (Steven Yeun)\r\nand Karen (Brit Marling). Then he meets a model whose eyes essentially take him\r\nemotional prisoner. At a party, Ian has a sexy encounter with a mostly masked\r\nwoman named Sofi (Astrid Berg\u00e8s-Frisbey) and can\u2019t stop thinking about her. He\r\nfinds himself pushed by fate or destiny to a billboard of her unforgettable\r\neyes, eventually tracking Sofi down and beginning a passionate romance with the\r\nwoman who will change his life. While the preview for \u201cI Origins\u201d gives away\r\nalmost the entire film, we\u2019ll stop the plot synopsis here\u2014it\u2019s better if you\r\ndon\u2019t know much\u2014but Ian\u2019s relationship with Sofi sends him down a very\r\ndifferent path than the scientific one on which he began. \u201cI Origins\u201d is a film\r\nabout how destiny and love can lead us to different revelations than we could\r\nhave possibly reached without them. Anyone who has known love can attest to its\r\nability to forever alter a charted course and Cahill\u2019s emotionally raw approach\r\nto filmmaking gets to the truth of that in a memorable way. It\u2019s also a remarkably confident film technically. Cinema\r\nhas had a love affair with the eye for a century now and Cahill and\r\ncinematographer Markus F\u00f6rderer take the timeless image of the eye and give it\r\nemotional resonance in the way they use it, balancing the film's two equally important halves. Cahill and his technical team\r\nwisely ground their film, only occasionally allowing it flights of visual\r\nfancy. We spend more time with Ian and Karen in a lab than we do in existential\r\npursuit of a greater purpose. And that makes the film\u2019s more extremely philosophical\r\nthemes forgivable. Cahill's work here is a notable technical advancement over \"Another Earth,\" proving he's not just a filmmaker with big ideas but one who can pull them off with visual confidence as well. There's a flow in the cinematography and editing that carries us along, only occasionally becoming untethered to a pretentious degree. Cahill\u2019s smartest move was to not allow his film\u2019s \u201cbig\r\nissues\u201d to overwhelm the human story at its core. And he\u2019s helped notably by\r\nyet-another strong performance from Michael Pitt, an actor who has shown such\r\nrange just recently from his terrifying work on TV's \u201cHannibal\u201d to this relatable,\r\nlikable performance. Advertisement The film's biggest problem is that the two women in Ian\u2019s life aren\u2019t as well-drawn as they\r\ncould have been in a superior film. Sofi and Karen feel a bit too much like\r\nobvious opposites\u2014the \"spiritual model\" and the \"scientific technician.\" If both\r\ncharacters were allowed a bit more of their alternate, \u201cI Origins\u201d would have\r\nbeen a more interesting venture. For, in the end, it\u2019s a film that argues we\r\ndon\u2019t live in a world of science OR faith but one in which both will give us a\r\ndeeper understanding of who we are and where we\u2019re going.", "Critic": "Beta"}
