{"Title": "One of Us", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The title\u00a0\"One of Us\" cuts deeply, in two directions. This documentary by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady zeroes in on three individuals who were once part of a tightly knit community of Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn, New York. All three eventually left the tribe, as it were, because they found its conditions for membership suffocating, even abusive.\u00a0 All three are caught by the filmmakers in the process of transforming themselves into secular Americans living life in the mainstream, enjoying the freedom that comes from being about to make bold personal choices, but also feeling abandoned and hated by the family and friends who remained on the other side. They're becoming part of a larger world now\u2014one of \"them\" as opposed to one of \"us,\"\u00a0or maybe the other way around.\u00a0 Advertisement Teenaged Ari endured a horrendous crime as a child that was covered up by his community; it eventually contributed to his cocaine addiction (he's survived two overdoses). Luzer is a twenty something man who realized one day that he couldn't stand to live under the constraints of the community, got a divorce, left his family New York and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming an actor. Etty, now 32, has the most disturbing story. She was pushed into marriage with an abusive man\u00a0at 19 and has had seven children. The\u00a0entire extended family plus a wider circle of friends have joined forces to stop her from\u00a0divorcing her husband and starting over.\u00a0 This is complex and often explosive subject matter, and in examining it, the excellent team of\u00a0Ewing and Grady (\u201cThe Boys of Baraka,\u201d \u201cJesus Camp\u201d and \u201cDetropia\")\u00a0tread as carefully as they can, given the constraints they're under. Specifically, they can only tell one side of this story: the Hasidim, who rail against the secular world and are suspicious of cell phones and the Internet,\u00a0aren't about to sit for interviews with these filmmakers. That means that we're never going to hear their side of things.\u00a0 This is not to say that whatever we might might have heard\u00a0would have created\u00a0an \"one the one hand, on the other hand\" dynamic\u2014clearly, all three of the filmmakers' subjects had excellent reasons for leaving the community, and even if their reasons had been flighty or\u00a0specious, they should still have had\u00a0the right to determine their own destiny without fear of being ostracized or punished. That said, the most fascinating, albeit quite\u00a0brief, portion of the movie comes in the form of a history lesson: we find out\u00a0that the Hasidic Jewish community sprung up as a response to the Holocaust\u2014that they see themselves as holy replacements for the millions who were slaughtered in the 1930s and '40s. Everyone, including abusers, have reasons for doing what they do; a bit more on this subject might've made an already wrenching documentary even more powerful.\u00a0 Then again, \"One of Us\" is so strong as-is that its more harrowing sections\u2014particularly Ari's account of his childhood suffering and the details of Etty's fight for freedom\u2014are so already hard to watch that you might want to turn away. There's nothing more exhilarating or more terrifying than taking control of one's own life.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
