{"Title": "The Wanted 18", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "U.S. citizens almost never process the news that comes out\r\nof the Middle East as occurring in the context of people who are trying to have\r\neveryday lives. Physical battle and argument seems so constant that we rarely\r\nextend our imaginative empathy into quotidian realms. Such as, for instance,\r\nPalestinians wanting to nourish their\r\nkids with milk, or who want to take their coffee in a form besides black. \u201cThe Wanted 18\u201d is an unusual documentary, co-directed by\r\nAmer Shomali and Paul Cowan about a late-1980s attempt in a Palestinian town to\r\nachieve dairy self-sufficiency. During the first uprising deemed an \u201cintifada\u201d\r\nin that period, Palestinians organized various boycotts of Israelis services\r\nand commodities, and to that end, in the town of Beit Sahour, an enterprising\r\nfellow purchased 18 milk cows from a liberal kibbutz tender. The movie begins\r\nwith co-director Shomali, who calls Beit Sahour his home town despite the fact\r\nthat he was raised in a refugee camp, remembering reading about these cows in a\r\ncomic book when he was a boy. This inspires the movie\u2019s most potentially\r\neyebrow-raising formal strategy: telling portions of the story via\r\ncomic-book-style graphics and stop-motion animation. Shomali raises the ante by\r\nanthropomorphizing four of the cows, giving them names\u2014Rikva, Ruth, Goldie, and\r\nLola\u2014and the power of speech. These Israel-raised cows are made to disdain their\r\nnew owners\u2014\u201cInfitada, shmintifada,\u201d one drawls\u2014but eventually their cynicism\r\nevolves into a drive to survive. Advertisement This gives rise to a potent metaphor, even as the direly\r\nquixotic nature of the town\u2019s project is acknowledged right off the bat.\r\n\u201cPalestinians don\u2019t have a cow culture,\u201d one of the interviewees allows. \u201cSheep\r\nand goats, yes. Cows, no.\u201d The initial misadventures of the new would-be dairy\r\nfarmers are comic, but soon the viewer sees the extent to which even these\r\nmaladroit efforts come to constitute a burr in the side of the Israeli would-be\r\nauthorities. One anecdote ends with an armed member of the Israeli security\r\nforce stepping out of his jeep and into a large pile of freshly laid manure,\r\nand the ensuing indignation. Jalal Oumsieh, one of the Beit Sahour residents\r\nwho got the ball rolling, has a hard time containing his amusement as he\r\nrecollects Israeli officials going door-to-door and waving portraits of bovines\r\nin people\u2019s faces while asking \u201cHave you seen this cow?\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}
