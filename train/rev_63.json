{"Title": "Game Over, Man!", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The stoner comedy style refined by Anders Holm, Blake Anderson and Adam DeVine on the Comedy Central hit \u201cWorkaholics\u201d for seven seasons has moved to Netflix and gotten even raunchier, crazier, and more defiantly reckless. \u201cWorkaholics\u201d meets \u201cDie Hard\u201d in the comedy \u201cGame Over, Man!,\u201d an admirably stupid affair that amply displays the abilities of its\u00a0comedic collaborators in a way that elevates it above many other Netflix original comedies but a movie that probably works better if you\u2019re seriously drunk or high. It\u2019s often clunky and often offensive, but there are moments that remind one how often \u201cWorkaholics\u201d was pretty damn funny in the way it captured a certain kind of man-child who can\u2019t leave the drunk/high/horny culture of college life behind even when they graduate to a cubicle. It will work best for those lamenting the cancellation of the Comedy Central hit that spawned it, but probably not much for anyone else. Advertisement \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d stars Holm, DeVine, and Anderson as three relatively interchangeable bros who work housekeeping at a fancy hotel. In their spare time, they work on a tech project called Skintendo, which is sort of a virtual reality thing, but they really use most of their time to get high and act like idiots (sort of like they did on \u201cWorkaholics\u201d). Leaning into the personalities developed on that show, Holm is the de facto leader of the group, mostly due to his ego, and Anderson is the sweeter, smarter member of the trio. DeVine is the borderline lunatic once again, giving the actor the chance to show off his physical comedy chops, and his willingness to do absolutely anything to get a laugh.    The action of the comedy takes place on the night of a major party at the rooftop bar of the hotel, hosted by the insanely popular and insanely wealthy Bey Awadi (Utkarsh Ambudkar). Just as the guys are mustering up the courage to present Bey with their tech startup idea \u201cShark Tank\u201d-style, a group of high-powered assassins (led by Neal McDonough and Rhona Mitra) take over the party. They\u2019re going to hold Bey and his party goers hostage, including a hotel employee played by Aya Cash of \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst,\u201d until they get millions of dollars transferred to their account. Our heroes stumble into a plan to stop them and save the hostages.    To say that \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d thrives on extreme comedy would be an understatement. Imagine the envelope-pushing humor of \u201cWorkaholics\u201d with no concern about offending advertisers. A few of the more extreme sequences in \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d feature autoerotic asphyxiation, attempts to torture Bey by making him toss another man\u2019s salad, and a severed penis used as a prop. It\u2019s the kind of thing that could send a conservative viewer to the hospital with cardiac arrest. I am far from a traditionally conservative viewer when it comes to comedy, but even I rolled my eyes at the ridiculousness of this whole enterprise a few times. On the one hand, there\u2019s something admirable about being willing to do anything for a joke. On the other, extremity isn\u2019t funny on its own unless you\u2019re really high.    Advertisement More problematic is how often \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d sabotages its best bits. There\u2019s a funny, extreme beat in which DeVine\u2019s character chooses to \u201chide\u201d by pretending to have choked himself to death with his dick in his hand in a closet. But then that bit is followed up by some pretty extreme homophobia. The \u201cWorkaholics\u201d brand of humor often pushes a joke past its breaking point\u2014where it goes from funny to annoying. And that happens more than once in \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d The best bits are often the quickest ones, including a scene with Shaggy that is undeniably funny, and the times when the comedians are just riffing off each other. And the movie gets markedly funnier as the pace picks up because of the plot. Early scenes that go on way too long\u2014there\u2019s a used condom bit that will likely have many viewers lunging for the SmartTV remote\u2014are supplanted by a quicker pace.\u00a0 \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d is grotesque, violent, insane\u00a0and offensive\u2014in other words, it\u2019s kind of exactly what you\u2019d expect from a \u201cWorkaholics\u201d movie unrestricted by basic cable censors. If you\u2019ve never seen the show, you might want to dip your toe in the water with it before jumping into this deep end. If you\u2019re already familiar, suit up and dive in. You know what you're getting into.", "Critic": "Beta"}
