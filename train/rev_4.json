{"Title": "Video Games: The Movie", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cVideo Games: The Movie\u201d doesn\u2019t just preach to the choir,\r\nit puts that choir on a pedestal and costumes it in golden robes. First, a\r\npersonal admittance: I\u2019m a bit of a video game nut. I can vividly remember the first\r\ntime I played \u201cSuper Mario Bros.,\u201d I had Commodore and Atari systems, I played\r\nmultiple \u201cZork\u201d games, have owned at least a dozen consoles in my life, and I have written hundreds of video game reviews for a number of outlets,\r\nincluding About.com. It\u2019s important that you not\u00a0write off\u00a0criticism of a movie\r\nabout the history of video games as coming from someone who isn\u2019t in tune with\r\nthe culture. I\u2019m in tune, man. And I still think \u201cVideo Games: The Movie\u201d is a\r\nmissed opportunity; a documentary that plays too much like fan service,\r\nignoring actual insight or even detailed history of its chosen subject in favor\r\nof unapologetic adoration. Video games are great! OK, where do we go from\r\nthere? Advertisement Writer/director Jeff Snead sets up his nostalgic approach to\r\nthe material with an opening credits sequence that essentially runs from \u201cPong\u201d\r\nto the 2013 games that launched new systems like the Playstation 4 and Xbox\r\nOne. You can almost hear fans calling out the characters\u2014\u201cLink!\u201d \u201cMario!\u201d \u201cMegaman!\u201d\r\n\u201cLara Croft\u201d\u2014on this visual journey through the development of the form. \u201cVideo\r\nGames: The Movie\u201d is steeped in nostalgia. Seeing old Playstation commercials\r\nof Crash Bandicoot harassing Nintendo offices or the original ads for\r\nthe infamously horrible tie-in with \u201cE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\u201d have inherent\r\nnostalgic value but Snead seems more interested in them then the actual history\r\nof the form. He\u2019s more excited by reliving the signposts than revealing how the\r\nroad got paved or where it\u2019s going. Snead didn\u2019t have too much difficulty getting a few\r\nluminaries of video game culture, both celebrities who have been vocal fans and\r\ngame designers themselves, to discuss what they love about games from \u201cBurger\r\nTime\u201d to \u201cMetal Gear Solid.\u201d Sean Astin narrates the doc and Snead intercuts\r\nmemories of video games past from Wil Wheaton, Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Max\r\nLandis, and more. He also got some time with pioneers like Peter Molyneux and\r\nHideo Kojima but doesn\u2019t allow them nearly enough time in front of the camera.\r\nMolyneux talking about the \u201cart debate,\u201d which Roger so infamously joined here,\r\nis enough conversational material for at least half an hour but Snead moves on\r\nquickly. \u201cVideo Games: The Movie\u201d has the same attention deficit disorder as\r\nour parents\u2019 generation claimed those harmless-looking Nintendo cartridges\r\nwould give us. Maybe they were right. Lest you think there\u2019s any exaggeration regarding the fan\r\nservice and self-importance of \u201cVideo Games: The Movie,\u201d you should know that\r\nthe film includes quotes by Gandhi and JFK. This is the context in which video\r\ngames are placed. And when Snead gets to actual issues like the art debate, the\r\nimpact of games on violence, the idea that Facebook is actually a video game,\r\nand, worst of all, the online community, he can\u2019t concentrate on any of them\r\nlong enough to register. The online stuff is particularly nauseating in that\r\nSnead frames online gaming as a major step in human evolution, ignoring any\r\npossible criticisms like the loss of productivity or the bullying and downright\r\nvile language/behavior that often happens in the online world. I\u2019m an online\r\ngamer. I love it. But you\u2019d learn more about the communities that sprout up\r\naround games by watching \u201cThe King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters\u201d than what\r\nplays like an infomercial for Playstation Plus.  Advertisement \u201cVideo Games: The Movie\u201d actually turns it around in the\r\nfinal third as Snead finally allows for some serious discussion of the current\r\nstate of the industry. I think the history of video games were too much of a\r\nnostalgic treat for him to avoid but his film finally loses the sugar rush when it comes to the\r\npresent and future. The film gets into the process behind masterpieces like \u201cThe\r\nLast of Us,\u201d discussing the importance of authorship on the part of the gamer\r\nand just how many moving parts have to click into place to make a great game. Personally,\r\nI think we\u2019re in an amazing time for video games and that they will only become\r\na deeper, more rewarding part of our entertainment culture. But I thought that\r\nbefore the movie too.", "Critic": "Beta"}
