{"Title": "Ned Rifle", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Hal Hartley\u2019s often fascinating \u201cNed Rifle\u201d feels like a\r\nvery conscious nod to the films that made its writer/director famous in the\r\nlate \u201880s and early \u201890s while also serving as a commentary on moving on from\r\npast successes and failures to face the future head on. It is the work most\r\nreminiscent of his quirky, clever character studies like \u201cThe Unbelievable\r\nTruth\u201d, \u201cTrust\u201d and \u201cSimple Men\u201d in decades, and reminded me why Hartley was so\r\nformative on my view of independent cinema in high school. Like those films, \u201cNed\r\nRifle\u201d has a jangly, unique energy, as people bounce off each other and then pause to philosophically ask what the bouncing means. Dialogue comes in sporadic\r\nbursts, edging on being too self-conscious for the narrative to hold\r\ntogether (as often happened in his later films) but there\u2019s such genuine\r\naffection for the characters of \u201cNed Rifle\u201d that it never falls apart, even as\r\nthese people sometimes sound like they\u2019re commenting on other films, filmmakers and the artistic process in general.\r\nThis is also Hartley at his most loosely hilarious in years, reuniting his\r\nfavorite actors and finding a new one who seems born for the timing of his\r\ncomedy. \u201cNed Rifle\u201d, the final chapter in a strange trilogy with \u201cHenry Fool\u201d and \u201cFay\r\nGrim\u201d, is a movie about damaged people coming to terms with their damage by\r\nturning to others. And it\u2019s Hal Hartley\u2019s best movie in years. Advertisement The title character is the son of the title characters from\r\nthe other two films: Edward Rifle (Liam Aiken), who has been living in witness\r\nprotection with a very emotionally supportive reverend (Hartley regular Martin Donovan) for the\r\nlast several years while mom was in prison. One very interesting element of \u201cNed\r\nRifle\u201d is how Hartley approaches religion without the cynicism or derision\r\noften seen in independent cinema. Ned is a deeply religious young man who\r\ncarries a bible and remains chaste in the face of regular temptation. But\r\nHartley doesn\u2019t turn this trait into an object of comedy or isolationism. On the contrary, it\r\nseems to ground Ned in a way that the other, free-floating characters lack.\r\nHartley\u2019s worldview has always been an open-door one, allowing for different\r\nphilosophies and trains of thought to run parallel to each other. At the same time that Ned turns old enough to leave his\r\ngiven home, his mother Fay (Parker Posey) is being moved to a new prison. He\r\ngoes to visit her first, before moving on to find his father (Thomas Jay Ryan),\r\nwith the expressed purpose of killing him for what he did to his mother (his God is apparently a vengeful one). To\r\nfind Henry, Ned first has to track down Simon (James Urbaniak), the poet made\r\nfamous despite his general allergy to public attention. Simon is holed up in a\r\nhotel, trying to figure out his next public move while taking comedy lessons\r\nand trying to do stand-up routines online via webcam. The image of a formerly vital artist\r\ntrying to figure out what\u2019s next can quite obviously be read as a bit of self-examination\r\nby Hartley, who could be perceived as having lost some of his resonance in the\r\nworld of independent cinema. When an admirer named Susan (Aubrey Plaza, who has\r\nthe perfect rhythm for Hartley\u2019s dialogue) generally stalks her way into Simon\u2019s\r\nworld, she reveals that she has done little more than write about him for years, even\r\nlosing her job as a film critic because every review came back to the poetry of\r\nSimon Grim. It turns out that Susan also has a deep connection to Henry\u2019s past,\r\nand she hooks up with Ned to track him down.  With a simple framing style, light score and remarkably\r\nshort running time, \u201cNed Rifle\u201d zips along from beginning to end, which may\r\nleave some fans of \u201cmeatier\u201d films like \u201cHenry Fool\u201d disappointed, but there\u2019s\r\nan infectious energy that makes this one of Hartley\u2019s most likable works. It\u2019s\r\nalso just damn funny and smart. Lines like \u201cThe\r\ngood of free will must entail real choices for sin\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019d think a religion would help teach\r\npeople how the ungodly operate\u201d zip by in the clever, dialogue-heavy script\r\nat such a fast pace that it almost demands a rewatch to catch all of them.\r\nThere are little beats (like when Fay asks Ned to call her at prison and adds \u201cI\u2019m always here\u201d) that made me smile\r\nthroughout, clearly sensing that Hartley himself was enjoying working in this\r\nworld one last time. And the final scenes, while a bit rushed narratively, have\r\na surprising emotional resonance. It gives one hope that closing the door on\r\nthese characters will invigorate Hartley to consistently make great films\r\nagain. \u201cNed Rifle\u201d reminds me how much I missed him.
