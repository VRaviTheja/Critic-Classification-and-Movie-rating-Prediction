{"Title": "Man from Reno", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "I\u2019m giving this movie half a star more than I really want to\r\nbecause I\u2019m aware that there are many contemporary moviegoers who are wired\r\ndifferently than I am. \u201cMan From Reno\u201d\u2014reviewers are going to almost\r\nreflexively want to call it \u201cThe Man From Reno,\u201d but once they\u2019ve actually got\r\nthe movie in mind they\u2019ll be reminded there\u2019s a good reason that\u2019s not the title\u2014is an intricately, even\r\ndensely, plotted mystery/thriller that casts an unusual spell from its opening\r\nscene. Pepe Serna plays Paul Del Moral, a sheriff in a small town south of San\r\nFrancisco. Out on a casual patrol one fog-shrouded evening, he finds an abandoned\r\ncar, reports on it, drives on, and is stunned when a man bounces off his\r\nwindshield. He brings the fellow to a hospital. The victim, a Japanese fellow\r\nin his 30s, is out cold.  Advertisement The movie cuts to a press conference in Japan. Young author\r\nAki Akahori (Ayako Fujitani) is being feted on the occasion of her latest\r\nnovel, which she tells her publicist will be the last featuring her popular creation, the seemingly Columbo-esque avuncular detective \u201cInspector Takabe.\u201d\r\nFreaked out by too much attention, and possibly something else, Aki hightails\r\nit to\u2026San Francisco. Without telling anyone. An impromptu meeting with some old\r\nfriends gives her a chance to show off some chops-in-deduction, traits the\r\nviewer is meant to believe she imbues her fictional creation with. But Aki\u2019s\r\nnot as cocky as all that. Toying with a straight razor in her hotel room\r\nbathtub, she\u2019s clearly in distress. Maybe the charming stranger who approaches\r\nher in the hotel bar, also Japanese, can provide some distraction if not\r\nsalvation. For a while the two narratives, that of Sheriff Del Moral\r\nand Aki, run on alternating parallel tracks. Co-writer/director Dave Boyle\r\nactually keeps the viewer guessing with respect to timelines; as various\r\n(unseen) Asian men keep turning up in different states of distressed being, and\r\nAki meets various other harried Japanese males, one is apt to wonder if the\r\nmovie\u2019s playing some sort of staggered-time game. As it happens, it\u2019s not. Once\r\nDel Moral and Aki find each other the plot both deepens and thickens. Serna, with\r\na good-humored gravitas that brings to mind Jason Robards, Jr., and Fujitani,\r\nwhose combination of vulnerability and sharpness is spectacularly appealing,\r\nmake a really intriguing team of investigators.  And that\u2019s part of the problem with the film, at least for\r\nme.  And here I must pause, and ponder the ethics of the spoiler\r\nalert. This should serve as a signal for any reader with a powerful interest in\r\nwatching the movie to stop reading now.  Still reading? Okay. Well, I\u2019m not going to give anything away,\r\nat least not directly. Instead, I shall comment on the general topic of Genre\r\nConvention and what I consider acceptable ways of Breaking Genre Convention.\r\nAny of you folks out there remember a 2008 Korean movie called \u201cThe Chaser?\u201d\r\nReally brutal, engrossing, race-against-time thriller that broke genre\r\nconvention in a lot of ways, not least of which was making its titular\r\nprotagonist the most unappealing character you could ever\r\nnot-want-to-but-nonetheless-be-compelled-to-root-for in a movie ever. Which was\r\nkind of exhilarating. But then\u2026Well, sometimes a movie oversteps its boundaries\r\nin an attempt to be \u201cdifferent,\u201d and sometimes that overstepping is a grave\r\nmiscalculation.\u00a0 Advertisement The last section of \u201cMan From Reno\u201d takes the movie into\r\nterritory explored by the original \u201cThe Vanishing\u201d and, of course, David\r\nFincher\u2019s \u201cZodiac.\u201d Legitimate avenues, arguably, but I have to admit, as a\r\nviewer who was engrossed and invested in the characters, said exploration ended\r\nup really pissing me off. But what if I\u2019m wrong to be pissed off? Hence, my\r\nthree-star rating of the movie as opposed to the two-and-a-half I\u2019d LIKE to\r\ngive it. I\u2019d really love (OK, maybe \u201clove\u201d isn\u2019t the right word) to discuss\r\nthis issue with viewers once they\u2019ve had a chance to see \u201cMan From Reno.\u201d Genre\r\nfans ought to check it out post haste. I\u2019m one myself, and my admiration for\r\nthe superb conception and execution of the film goes hand in hand with\r\ndisappointment and irritation. My question for myself is, do I have a critical\r\nleg to stand on, or am I taking the movie too personally? I have to give it\r\ncredit for even making the question come up in the first place.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
