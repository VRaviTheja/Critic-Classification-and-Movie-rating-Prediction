{"Title": "Deathgasm", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "What if all those people who told you metal was the devil\u2019s\r\nmusic were right? What if playing the right heavy tune could actually bring\r\nforth the end of the world? Such is the clever premise of Jason Lei Howden\u2019s\r\npromising zom-rom-com debut \u201cDeathgasm,\u201d a film destined for midnight movie\r\nmarathons. As is often the case with films that crib from the horror-comedy\r\nmasters like Peter Jackson, the balance is tougher to pull off than it first\r\nappears, and \u201cDeathgasm\u201d gets a bit numbing and repetitive before it\u2019s over,\r\nbut there\u2019s enough fun, clever material here for metalheads and horror fans to\r\nlike until Sean Byrne\u2019s superior \u201cThe Devil Candy\u201d (a TIFF hit that also plays\r\nwith that elusive dynamic between metal and Satan) lands sometime next year. Advertisement Brodie (the natural Milo Cawthorne) has just moved to a\r\nmiserable new town, one in which he clearly doesn\u2019t belong. Staying with his\r\nultra-religious aunt and uncle, Brodie wears his metalhead status like a crown,\r\nrefusing to give into bullies like his cousin or the perceived suburban norm.\r\nAfter a few false starts of friendship with other social misfits who have\r\nsuffered similar bully abuse, Brodie finally thinks he\u2019s found a soulmate in Zakk\r\n(James Blake) another guy who paints his face and rocks out. Brodie also notices\r\nthe prettiest girl at school, the charming Medina (Kimberley Crossman), and\r\nfalls hard, even though she\u2019s dating his jock cousin. After being bullied one\r\ntoo many times and failing to win the heart of the blonde lass, Brodie plays a\r\nsong with his new band, DEATHGASM (all caps, of course), and inadvertently brings\r\nforth a demon force known as The Blind One, instantly plunging their normal\r\ncorner of the world into bloody chaos. Can the rockers survive the end of the\r\nworld? I do mean instantly.\r\nOne of the more admirable elements of \u201cDeathgasm\u201d is how little time Howden\r\nwastes once the demonic viscera hits the fan. This is not a slow burn\u2014it\u2019s an\r\norgy of crazy violence and impressive make-up effects. Before the guys know it,\r\neveryone around them has been possessed by something that looks like what Ash\r\nlocked in the basement in \u201cEvil Dead 2.\u201d The summoning song is played and\r\nsuddenly people are puking blood and faces are getting power-sanded. Through it\r\nall, Howden keeps an admirable, Jackson-esque levity in the film that works\r\nmore often than it falters. Dialogue like, \u201cIt\u2019s\r\nweird, but I think he would have wanted to go out like this,\u201d after a\r\nparticularly brutal death keep things from getting overly gross and repulsively gory for a while\r\n(I also particularly enjoyed a bad guy ordering someone be decapitated a second\r\ntime to confused looks of his minions). However, gorehounds need not worry that a movie called \u201cDeathgasm\u201d\r\nplays it safe. This is a defiantly, well, metal movie. From a possessed human\r\nbeing bludgeoned with a sex toy to a guy whose head and spine are literally\r\nripped from his body, there are a number of opportunities for the film\u2019s\r\nfanbase to give devil horns to the screen. At its best, it\u2019s like a Megadeth\r\nalbum cover sprung to life. The only problems come, as they often do in films\r\nlike this, in the pacing department. To be honest, it\u2019s another trait shared\r\nwith metal in that a lot of heavy albums get numbing and exhausting around the\r\n2/3rds mark. That\u2019s about when I was ready for \u201cDeathgasm\u201d to finish up its\r\nencore.  Advertisement Howden\u2019s debut is helped greatly by his cast, especially\r\nCawthorne and Crossman, a cute couple who go well beyond \u201cdork\u201d and \u201cpopular\r\ngirl\u201d to ground their characters in ways that horror often misses. The director\r\nand his stars commit to the insanity of their project. They\u2019re the kind of fans\r\nwho don\u2019t just go to a concert, they wear the t-shirt of the band playing\r\nthat night, paint their faces, and trick out their car with paintings of devils\r\nand dragons. That commitment can be infectious\u2014or at least admirable.", "Critic": "Beta"}
