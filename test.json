{"Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Martin Scorsese's \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is abashed and shameless, exciting and exhausting, disgusting and illuminating; it's one of the most entertaining films ever made about loathsome men. Its star Leonardo DiCaprio has compared it to the story of the Roman emperor Caligula, and he's not far off the mark.\u00a0 Adapted by Terence Winter from the memoir by stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who oozed his way into a fortune in the 1980s and '90s, this is\u00a0an excessive film about excess, and a movie about appetites whose own appetite for compulsive pleasures seems bottomless. It runs three hours, and was reportedly cut down from four by Scorsese's regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker. It's a testament to Scorsese and Winter and their collaborators that one could imagine watching these cackling swine for five hours, or ten, while still finding them fascinating, and our own fascination with them disturbing. This is a reptilian brain movie. Every frame has scales.\u00a0 Advertisement The middle-class, Queens-raised Belfort tried and failed to establish himself on Wall Street in a more traditional way\u2014we see his tutelage in the late '80s at a blue chip firm, under the wing of a grinning sleazeball played by Matthew McConaughey\u2014but got laid off in the market crash of 1987. He reinvented himself on Long Island by taking over a penny stock boiler room and giving it an old money name, Stratton Oakmont, to gain the confidence of middle- and working-class investors. Per Wikipedia, at its peak, \"the firm employed over\u00a01000 stock brokers and was involved in stock issues totaling more than $1 billion, including an equity raising for footwear company\u00a0Steve Madden Ltd.\" Belfort and his company specialized in \"pump and dump\" operations: artificially blowing up the value of a nearly worthless stock, then selling it at a big profit, after which point the value drops and the investors lose their money. Belfort was indicted in 1998 for money laundering and securities fraud, spent nearly two years in federal prison and was ordered to pay back $110 million to investors he'd deceived.\u00a0 Taking its cues from gangster pictures, \"Wolf\" shows how Belfort rose from humble origins, becoming rich and notorious (the title comes from an unflattering magazine profile that caught the attention of federal prosecutors). This Robin Hood-in-reverse builds himself a team of merry men drawn from various sundry corners of his life. All have both given names and Damon Runyon-esque nicknames:\u00a0Robbie Feinberg, aka \"Pinhead\" (Brian Sacca),\u00a0Alden Kupferberg, aka \"Sea Otter\" (Henry Zebrowski), the dreadfully-toupeed \"Rugrat\"\u00a0Nicky Koskoff (P.J. Byrne), \"The Depraved Chinaman\" Chester Ming (Kenneth Choi), and Brad Bodnick (Shane Bernthal of \"The Walking Dead\"), a DeNiro-esque neighborhood hothead who's known as the Quaalude King of Bayside. His office enforcer is his volcanic dad (Rob Reiner), who screams about expenditures and workplace sleaze, but often seems to live vicariously through the trading floor's young wolves. Belfort's right hand man Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) is perhaps even more conscienceless than Belfort: a hefty wiseass with gleaming choppers who quits his job at a diner after one conversation with the hero, joins his scheme, helps him launder money, and introduces him to crack\u2014as if Belfort didn't have enough intoxicants in his system, on top of the adrenaline he generates by making deals and bedding every halfway attractive woman who crosses his path. As McConaughey's character tells Belfort early on, this subset of investing is so scummy that drugs are mandatory: \"How the f\u2014 else would you do this job?\" At one point a broker declares that they're doing all that coke and all those Quaaludes and guzzling all that booze \"in order to stimulate our freethinking ideas.\"\u00a0 Advertisement Belfort is married when the tale begins, to a good and respectable woman who doesn't approve of his financial shenanigans or chronic infidelity, but he soon throws her over for a blond and curvy trophy named Naomi LaPaglia (Australian actress Margot Robbie), then marries her and starts supporting her in the style to which they've both become accustomed. After a few years, Belfort is living in a mansion that another DiCaprio character, Jay Gatsby, might find gaudy, and buying a yacht, and helicoptering to and from meetings and parties while drugged out of his mind. Then a federal prosecutor named Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) enters the picture, sweating Belfort by confronting him on his own turf (including Belfort's yacht) and letting him brag on his own awesomeness until he hangs himself. Imagine the last thirty minutes of \"GoodFellas\" stretched out to three hours. That's the pace of this movie, and the feel of it. It's one damned thing after another: stock fraud and money laundering; trips to and from Switzerland to deposit cash in banks (and give the increasingly wasted Belfort a chance to flirt with his wife's British aunt, played by \"Absolutely Fabulous\" costar Joanna Lumley); rock-and-pop driven montages with ostentatious film speed shifts (including a slow-motion Quaalude binge); and some daringly protracted and seemingly half-improvised dialogue scenes that feel like tiny one-act plays. The best of these is McConaughey's only long scene as Belfort's mentor Mark Hanna, who at one point thumps a drum pattern on his chest while rumble-singing a la Bobby McFerrin; this eventually becomes the anthem of Belfort's firm, and it's weirdly right, as it suggests a tribal war song for barbarians on permanent rampage.\u00a0 As is often the case in Scorsese's films, \"Wolf\" gives alpha male posturing the attraction-repulsion treatment, serving up the drugging and whoring and getting-over as both spectacle and cautionary tale. In his most exuberant performance since \"Titanic,\" DiCaprio plays Belfort as a pipsqueak Mussolini of the trading floor, a swaggering jock who pumps his guys up by calling them \"killers\" and \"warriors\" and attracts hungry, self-destructive women, partly via brashness and baby-faced good looks, but mostly by flashing green. The film lacks the mild distancing that Scorsese brought to \"GoodFellas\" and \"Casino.\" The former contrasted Henry Hill's matter-of-fact narration with occasionally shocked reactions to bloodshed; \"Casino\" adopted a Stanley Kubrick-like chilly detachment, as if everyone involved were narrating from a cloud in Heaven or a pit in Hell. \"Wolf\" is\u00a0in the thick of things at all times, to suffocating effect, depriving the viewer of moral anchors.\u00a0 Advertisement This is not the same thing as saying that the film is amoral, though. It's not. It's disgusted by this story and these people and finds them grotesque, often filming them from distorted angles or in static wide shots that make them seem like well-dressed animals in lushly decorated terrariums.\u00a0 You can tell how much Belfort cares about his people by the way his narration segues from an anecdote about a broker who fell into a spiral of misery and shame: \"He got depressed and killed himself three years later,\" Belfort says over a photo of a corpse in a bathtub trailing blood from slit wrists. Then, without missing a beat, he says, \"Anyway...\" The brokers classify prostitutes by cost and attractiveness, referring to them as \"blue chips, \"NASDAQs\" and \"pink sheets\" (or \"skanks\"); they're warm-blooded receptacles to be screwed and sent on their way, much like the firm's clients, including shoe mogul Steve Madden, whose deal Belfort describes as an oral rape. The directorial high point is a Belfort-Azoff Quaalude binge that spirals into comic madness, with Azoff blubbering and freaking out and stuffing his face and collapsing, and Belfort suffering paralysis during a panicked phone call about his money and then crawling towards his car like a nearly-roadkilled animal, one agonizing inch at a time.\u00a0 These images of censure and humiliation\u2014and there are a lot of them, including a gif-worthy moment of Belfort paying a prostitute to stick a lit candle in his bum\u2014coexist with moments that get off on the men's howling and profit-making and chest-thumping. We're supposed to figure out how we feel about the mix of modes, and accept that if there were no appeal whatsoever to this kind of behavior, no one would indulge in it. This isn't wishy-washy. It's honest. Scorsese and Winter never lose track of the bigger picture.\u00a0In theory, the movie's subject is the Wall Street mentality, which is just a clean-scrubbed version of the gangster mentality showcased in Scorsese's \"Mean Streets,\" \"GoodFellas\" and \"Casino\" (one could make a case that guys like Belfort are the ones who pushed the Vegas mob out of Vegas). \"Wolf\" starts with a Fellini-like party on the floor of Belfort's firm, then freeze-frames on Belfort tossing a dwarf at a huge velcro target, literally and figuratively abusing the Little Guy. The traders get away with their abuse because most people don't see themselves as little guys, but as little guys who might some day become the big guy doing the tossing. \"Socialism never took root in America,\" John Steinbeck wrote, \"because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as\u00a0temporarily embarrassed millionaires.\u201d Belfort chides the prosecutor Denham for living what Henry Hill would have called the goody-two-shoes life, and in a scene near the end, as Denham rides the subway home, we can see that the taunt stuck in his craw.\u00a0Everyone at Belfort's firm seems to have the same title: \"senior vice-president.\" Everybody wants to rule the world. But the film's vision goes beyond cultural anthropology and antihero worship. When people ask me what the film is about, I tell them that like a good many films by Scorsese\u2014who overcame a cocaine problem in the early '80s\u2014at its root, it's about addiction: a disease or condition that seizes hold of one's emotions and imagination, and makes it hard to picture any life but the one you're already in.\u00a0Many people get a contact high from following the exploits of entrepreneurs, financiers, bankers, CEO and the like, and when such men (they're nearly always men) get busted for skirting or breaking laws, they root for them as if they were disreputable folk heroes, gangsters with fountain pens instead of guns\u2014guys who, for all their selfishness and cruelty, are above the petty rules that constrict the rest of us. Such men are addicts, egged on by a cheering section of little guys who fantasize of being big. We enable them by reveling in their exploits or not paying close enough attention to their misdeeds, much less demanding reform of the laws they bend or ignore\u2014laws that might have teeth if we hadn't allowed guys like Belfort (and his far more powerful role models) to legally bribe the United States legislative branch via the nonsensical \"system\" of campaign financing.\u00a0After a certain number of decades, we should ask if the nonstop enabling of addicts like Belfort doesn't mean that, in some sense, their enablers are addicted, too\u2014that they (we) are part of a perpetual-motion wheel that just keeps turning and turning.\u00a0In the end \"Wolf\" is not so much about one addict as it is about America's addiction to capitalist excess and the \"He who dies with the most toys wins\" mindset, which has proved as durable as the image of the snarling gangster taking what he likes when he feels like taking it.\u00a0 Advertisement Scorsese and Winter aren't shy about drawing connections between Belfort's crew and the thugs in Scorsese's mob pictures. Those mob films are addiction stories, too. \u00a0\"Wolf of Wall Street\" showcases Belfort Henry Hill-style, as if he were an addict touring the wreckage of his life in order to confess and seek forgiveness; but like a lot of addicts, as Belfort recounts the disasters he narrowly escaped, the lies he told and the lives he ruined, you can feel the buzz in his voice and the adrenaline burning in his veins. You can tell he misses his old life of big deals and money laundering and decadent parties, just as Hill missed busting heads, jacking trucks, and doing enough cocaine to make Scarface's head explode.\u00a0 There will be a few points during \"Wolf\" when you think, \"These people are revolting, why am I tolerating this, much less getting a vicarious thrill from it?\" At those moments, think about what the \"it\" refers to. It's not just these characters, and this setting, and this particular story. It's the world we live in. Men like Belfort represent us, even as they're robbing us blind. They're America, and on some level we must be OK with them representing America, otherwise we would have seen reforms in the late '80s or '90s or '00s that made it harder for men like Belfort to amass a fortune, or that at least quickly detected and harshly punished their sins.\u00a0Belfort was never punished on a level befitting the magnitude of pain he inflicted. According to federal prosecutors, he failed to abide by the terms of his 2003 restitution agreement. He's a motivational speaker now, and if you read interviews with him, or his memoir, it's obvious that he's not really sorry about anything but getting caught.\u00a0We laugh at the movie, but guys like Belfort will never stop laughing at us."}
{"Stars": 1.5, "Review": "American writer/director Steven Shainberg is an uncompromisingly idiosyncratic filmmaker, which is one reason, I infer, that he\u2019s only made four features in a career that began in 1996. His commitment to pursuing his vision\u2014which, in part is invested in putting a highbrow gloss on what is generally considered genre material\u2014is entirely admirable in the abstract. It\u2019s in the material results department that things get dicey. His 1996 debut, \u201cHit Me,\u201d ostensibly adapted from a Jim Thompson novel, was one of the most laboriously pretentious and tedious noir variations of its decade. Shainberg did hit paydirt with 2002\u2019s \u201cSecretary,\u201d a dominance-and-submission tale that applied erotic-dimestore-paperback stylings to a Mary Gaitskill short story, and had career-high performances from James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal. 2006\u2019s \u201cFur\u201d misfired badly, ostentatiously applying overextended metaphor to a consideration of the life and art of Diane Arbus. Advertisement \u201cRupture\u201d is Shainberg\u2019s first film from his own original story, although said story contains a lot of familiar elements. Noomi Rapace plays Renee, a single mom of Canadian origin stuck in Middle America trying to do the best she can with a rebellious tween son and a terrifically unpleasant ex-husband. Early in the film, feeds from small video cameras show that Renee is under surveillance; a small device clamped on to one of her car\u2019s tires suggests even more sinister goings-on. Sure enough, a blowout sends Renee to the side of the road and also to a rather elaborately staged abduction, during which her face is wrapped in shiny black duct tape. Why shiny black, you may ask. Indeed. As it eventually becomes clear that Renee ought to be delivered to her captors in good health, the better for them to manipulate it, you\u2019d think that her handling might call for more actual care. But, you know, shiny black duct tape looks cool and threatening. Soon Renee is strapped down, hard, to a metal gurney, which makes a lot of metallic noises as she bangs her body against it. She\u2019s in a room with a triple-deadbolt lock that makes a neat \u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201d clang whenever it\u2019s shut. The lighting of the room is peach-purple and the walls look like rotting meat. The production design is a tired mix of clich\u00e9 and dink. A couple of seeming functionaries, played by Michael Chiklis and Lesley Manville, show up, don silly rubber goggled with extended lens holders, and phone in some menace. A fellow prisoner gibbers to Renee through a heating vent, mentioning something called \u201cG-ten-twelve-X.\u201d When she repeats the letters and numbers to her captors, one of them says \u201cIf you find out what that is then you\u2019ve made real progress.\u201d Curiouser and curiouser then\u2014if, as it happens, you wind up caring. This movie did not turn that trick for me. Eventually Renee does break free from the gurney, and goes crawling through the air vents, and witnesses the torture, physical and psychological, of the other presumable kidnap victims. Which goes on for what seems like 40 straight minutes (it\u2019s not, but it sure feels it) and is put into some kind of relief by the possibility that it\u2019s all being staged for Renee\u2019s benefit anyway. It\u2019s not involving; it\u2019s not scary; it\u2019s just kind of miserable. When the ultimate purpose of Renee\u2019s ordeal comes to light\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a spoiler to comment that it\u2019s like a self-empowerment seminar scripted by M. Night Shyamalan\u2014the compensation for the aforementioned misery seems scant indeed.\u00a0 Advertisement"}
{"Stars": 2.0, "Review": "In 1960, three years after the publication of \"On the Road\", which made him a celebrity, Jack Kerouac was finding his fame wearying. He was pushing forty, and harassed by beatnik groupies who thought he had the answers to Life. He was a severe alcoholic. Fearful that he was losing his grip on his art, he went to stay in poet pal Lawrence Ferlinghetti's Big Sur cabin for a back-to-nature writing retreat. It didn't quite work out as planned, and the book that resulted, titled \"Big Sur\", is an excruciating howl of pain exacerbated by delirium tremens and restless anxiety that sometimes tipped into insanity. Written in Kerouac's typically honest stream-of-consciousness style, and owing much to James Joyce, \"Big Sur\" exists entirely inside the mind of a man going mad.  Advertisement Michael Polish's \"Big Sur\", starring Jean-Marc Barr of \"Dogville\" as Kerouac is a strangely tepid experience for such searing psychological material. The fault lies in the heavy reliance on voiceover (all taken from the book), which distances us from what is happening onscreen. Scenes are not allowed to unfold, to explode, to develop, to sit there, because the voiceover is too insistent, interjecting itself every other moment. What would have happened if the voiceover had been used more sparingly? What f the beautiful collage effect of Kerouac's time in the woods (the film is stunningly beautiful) had been allowed to develop on its own, leaving more room for interpretation, chaos, life? There are moments that are allowed to breathe, but they are few and far between.  The acting is all excellent, once you push past the voiceover that stands between you and the performances. Josh Lucas plays Neal Cassady (a brilliant casting choice). Anthony Edwards is excellent as Ferlinghetti, openly concerned about Kerouac's lifestyle and drinking, but fearful of being a nag about it. Kate Bosworth plays Billie, Neal's mistress, who is then passed off to Kerouac. There's a quiet moment (un-interrupted by voiceover) during a party at the Big Sur cabin when Cassady lays his head down on Kerouac's shoulder, an intimate and cuddly gesture. In the book, Kerouac writes of Cassady that he \"carries that strange apocalyptic burst of gold he somehow always manages to produce.\" Just by showing up, Josh Lucas embodies that magic, in both its elusive quality and its light-hearted sense that all things may still be possible, even after all of the disappointments.  The shots of Big Sur (M. David Mullen is the gifted cinematographer) woven throughout the film\u2014the billowing fog, the towering redwoods, the long line of crashing waves, the cloudy sky out to sea\u2014are magnificent as well as alienating. The visuals evoke a beauty so grand that we can never hope to enter into it. It is a beauty that is closed to Kerouac, a fact that he finds distressing. We see Kerouac sitting by the waves staring out to sea. We see him wading by the creek, we see him typing. He reads \"Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde\" by the fire, and, of course, over the course of the film his own split personality will crack open, revealing the abyss within. It is clear that there will be no coming back from Big Sur. Something died during his short time out there. He had less than 10 years left to live. Watching \"Big Sur\", you are amazed Kerouac lasted even that long.  The film is quite strong in its unblinking portrayal of alcoholism, depression, and mania, but it would have been stronger without a voice telling me over and over and over again how I was supposed to be feeling about it.

{"Stars": 2.5, "Review": "An illuminating moment occurs early on in \"We the Parents,\" a new documentary directed by James Takata about the first parents in California to utilize the new \"Parent Trigger\" Law, wherein if parents in a failing school district get enough signatures on a petition, they can request that their local school either close down or become a charter school. In December 2010, a group of parents in Compton, in southern Los Angeles County, presented a petition to Karen Frison, the Superintendent of that district. A swarm of news cameras and reporters push in on the two main figures \"starring\" in this historic moment. As she hands it over, the parent presenting the petition, visibly nervous, says, \"Because we care about our kids.\" Ms. Frison replies, kind but firm, \"We care about your kids, too.\"  Advertisement In that one simple exchange, the complexity of education reform is laid bare. \"We the Parents\" is pretty slight (only an hour long), and focuses only on the first Parent Trigger cases in California. At times it feels like a promotional video for Parent Revolution, the not-for-profit group that helps parents organize themselves and gather enough signatures to start the Parent Trigger process in motion. Some room is given to voices on the opposite side of the fence, but not enough. It is not a full picture. And teachers aren't represented at all in the film.  I come from a family filled with teachers, so perhaps the absence of teachers in the film is something that bothered me more than it should. Teachers are on the front lines every day, dealing with unimaginable stresses on the back end, not to mention low salaries and constant criticism from every direction. It would have been nice to hear how the teachers in Compton felt about what was happening in their school district.  It would be difficult to debate that we don't need educational reform in this country. And for parents like the ones we meet in \"We the Parents\", who live in notoriously terrible school districts, there isn't time to wait. Bureaucracy is slow and frustrating, and institutions are resistant to change. Meanwhile, as the statistics tell us in the film, in white letters on a black screen, \"less than 4% of kids in Compton qualify to apply to California state university.\" It is clearly an urgent situation.  Parent Revolution acts as the real \"trigger\" here, picking out schools to help, and, as Ben Austin, director of Parent Revolution, says, to help \"incentivize a revolt\" in the parents. (Austin has business-speak down cold.) Some of the parents in Compton are open to the organizers who come knocking on their door to talk about charter schools and petitions, and others say \"No, thanks.\" But over the course of a couple of months, enough signatures are gathered to present to the Superintendent. The petition then goes into the bureaucratic maze of School Boards and committees. The Parent Trigger Law is new, and nobody seems to know what the process really is. The people in Compton are the pioneers.  Advertisement Dr. Carl Cohn, a former superintendent, gives terrific background on Compton as a community, context that is necessary to understand the bitterness that is stirred up in the community as a result of the petition. Compton, as he says, \"feel(s) like they've been picked on by the media for years.\" The people who live there are sensitive to the image of their town as overrun by violence, drive-by shootings, and chaos.  So to have it touted in the media that their schools are the worst in the state, that there is a \"problem in Compton\" does not go over well. School Board meetings get hostile. Parent Revolution is pilloried in the local press and local radio.  One guy calls into a radio show and yells that Parent Revolution pretends it's a grass-roots organization when really it is \"funded by billionaires\"! Parent Revolution does not hide its funding sources, but one can certainly understand the resentment of Compton at being overrun by do-gooders, who all wear identical T-shirts saying \"I Am the Revolution.\"  Marty Hillerman, of the CA Federation of Teachers, is one of the few critical voices given space in the film. He says that this \"movement\" belittles teachers, and it is a mistake to assume that parents know better than people who have worked in education for decades. He criticizes Parent Revolution as a \"vehicle for some very rich people to found an organization and go into communities and disrupt them.\"  Emotions run high. The parents interviewed are sweet, sincere, and seem bowled over by the fact that they would have any power to enact change. Many of them are high school dropouts and want better for their kids. They can't move to a better school district. They want change locally. The pressure is on, because people like Matt Lauer and Brian Williams pontificate about what is happening on national news shows.  Cinematographer Milton Santiago shoots the streets of Compton in an emotional and simple way. There are myth-busting shots of nice houses with little lawns, girls doing cartwheels in the grass, people riding bikes. But there are also shots showing the economic devastation of the area: posters hollering \"I BUY SHORT SALES,\" furniture piled on the sidewalk, giant handwritten banners saying \"Put Compton Back 2 Work.\" Local churches often pick up the slack, providing space for people to meet and organize, as well as opening charter schools of their own.  Advertisement The petition put forth by the Compton parents is rejected, on what appears to be a technicality (the petitions had no dates on them). It is a disappointment. But other communities have followed Compton's lead. Parent Revolution is there, providing organizational help, buses to drive the parents to Sacramento to go to meetings at the State House, and, of course, lots and lots of T-shirts.  Little black-and-white cartoons give us funny visuals of how the Parent Trigger Law works, with petitions piling up on one side of a see-saw with a cute little school house on the other side. A stilted informational voiceover is used intermittently. While it is impossible to not sympathize with the parents in Compton and the other failing school districts, Marty Hillerman's words create a giant reverb in the film, one that is difficult to ignore.  Karen Frison, the superintendent who received the Compton petition in the scene starting off the film, says later on that the entire process has helped the school board in the district to \"re-think how we operate.\" That is a good thing. Bureaucracies can always try for a little bit more self-awareness. But when a parent stands up at a school board meeting and says, \"We just want what is best for our kids,\" it makes me think of A.O. Scott's words in his review for \"Won't Back Down\" (2012), based loosely on the Parent Trigger events in California: \"A movie that insists, repeatedly and at high volume, that 'it's all about the kids' might just cause you to wonder what else it is about, and this one is not shy about showing its ideological hand. Who, after all, could possibly be against kids?\"  Three new schools will open in different communities this month in California, as a result of the Parent Trigger Law, so time will tell if it will make a difference in students' test scores and achievement levels.  \"We the Parents,\" one-sided and promotional as it often feels, presents a possible solution, as well as the difficulties in achieving it."}
{"Stars": 2.5, "Review": "John Butler\u2019s \"The Bachelor Weekend\" is a genial comedy with likable enough characters to get one through its modest running time and meager intentions but it succumbs to a few too many clich\u00e9s and paper-thin characterizations to fulfill its potential. Worst of all, it allows one larger-than-life character to steal too much focus and drag the narrative into a predictable arc we've seen so many times before: the boorish lout who breaks the more docile types out of their shells. There are emotional moments that are surprisingly effective (mostly thanks to the talents \"Sherlock\" star Andrew Scott), a few good laughs, and hints at the film that could have been with just a few rewrites. It\u2019s not quite a \"lost\" weekend, merely misplaced. Advertisement More accurately known as \"The Stag\" overseas, \"The Bachelor Weekend\" stars Hugh O\u2019Conor as Fionnan, the kind of sensitive groom-to-be who makes dioramas of his reception and serves as the main contact for the event\u2019s florist. Even the wedding planner calls him metrosexual. His fianc\u00e9e Ruth (Amy Huberman) asks Best Man Davin (Andrew Scott, Moriarty from \"Sherlock\") to organize a \"stag.\" Fionnan, Davin, and their best friends will hike the great outdoors, getting in touch with nature and themselves. Travelers include Fionnan\u2019s brother \"Little Kevin\" (Michael Legge), Kevin\u2019s partner \"Big Kevin\" (Andrew Bennett), and friend Simon (Brian Gleeson). Of course, they all have a bit of drama to explore on their journey. Kevin\u2019s father refuses to attend Fionnan's wedding if his son\u2019s partner is there. And Simon is undergoing serious financial difficulties that have plunged him into depression. While you might think there\u2019s enough movie there, Butler throws a powder keg into the campfire by introducing \"The Machine\" (Peter McDonald), Ruth\u2019s obnoxious, loud, possibly crazy brother. The Machine forces his way on the stag, despite having nothing in common with Fionnan and his mates. He threatens to destroy the whole adventure (and, for a time, the whole movie). Of course, anyone who\u2019s ever seen a film can tell you that there\u2019s more to The Machine than he lets on and that he\u2019ll help pull these gentlemen out of their shells whether they want to step out or not. There are times when Butler\u2019s sweet, character-driven comedy works, such as an argument about U2 in which The Machine literally can\u2019t believe that there\u2019s an Irishman who didn\u2019t cry at their concert, a very funny bit about how Davin feels that Fionnan only likes things after he does so first, and a musical interlude around the bonfire. \"The Bachelor Weekend\" is a screenwriting tug-of-war. Every moment that feels character-driven is off-set by one that feels forced. If McDonald isn\u2019t pushing the overbearing Machine routine (which, to be fair, isn\u2019t the actor\u2019s fault but Butler\u2019s script), the characters are going through too many predictable revelatory moments, especially in the last half-hour (the treacly piano keys kick in at almost exactly the hour mark). \"The Bachelor Weekend\" is at its best not in its scenes of men acting like children or the beats that feel more written than organic but in its most believable scenes of joyful, male friendship in between the broad humor and melodrama. I just wish there were more of them. Advertisement"}
