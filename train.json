{"Title": "Birdboy: The Forgotten Children", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In his groundbreaking graphic novel Maus, Art Spiegelman took a giant artistic risk that paid off painfully and beautifully. The work is a remembrance/memoir of Spiegelman\u2019s own family and their experience of the Holocaust. The risk is in the telling: Spiegelman cast it as a version of a funny-animal cartoon. Jews were mice, Nazis were cats. The shock of the metaphor, the way the reader had to grapple with its \u201ctaste issues,\u201d and much more, made for an unusually moving and unsettling experience. Advertisement Spiegelman began Maus\u00a0in 1980. In the nearly 40 years since, it has proven influential in varied media (Spiegelman himself accused the 1986 animated film \u201cAn American Tail\u201d of plagiarizing Maus). The new Spanish animated film, \u201cBirdboy: The Forgotten Children,\u201d directed by Alberto V\u00e1zquez and Pedro Rivero, adapted from V\u00e1zquez\u2019s comic, is an oft-grisly and always visually dazzling allegorical fantasy that puts funny animals in a post-dystopian semi-wasteland. The movie opens in darkness, with a child\u2019s voice saying, \u201cThe future is the past, garbage is our present. Blood is our law!\u201d The color palette of a world prior to an industrial accident that looks nuclear or worse is one of pink pastels and black silhouettes.\u00a0 Once disaster hits, the modes are Kafka meets Marquez meets Mickey Mouse and/or Maus, and many more. The central character is Dinky, a little mouse with a persistent robot alarm clock and religious fanatic parents. Her dad likes to teach her lesson while squeezing a ruby Baby Jesus squeak toy, which seems to ooze real blood. Dinky is eager to escape them, and so she sets out with two friends, a rabbit and a fox, to seek a new place to live with Birdboy, a former friend of Dinky\u2019s whose story has acquired mythical dimensions in the time they\u2019ve been apart. In addition to the horrible environment, the kids have to battle their own demons, which encourage them to push each other off cliffs and do other nasty things. A giant black spider chases them around an abandoned house. Eventually they wind up in a waste site, ruled by a rat king and his child cult\u2014these are the ones for which blood is law. In the meantime, Birdboy himself is on a Personal Journey, remembering his lighthouse-keeper father before sinking into the see, to be overwhelmed by parasite-like creatures who look like smushed-up smiley emojis. Advertisement As you might infer, none of this is really kid\u2019s stuff. The good characters endure almost constant beatings, and the baddies are incredibly bloodthirsty and menacing. The variegated but never slick character design and animation is based on relatively simple drawing styles, and yet the characters are as vivid and sometimes scarier than the very technologically advanced nasties of, say, \u201cToy Story 3\u201d (a film to which this actually does owe a bit of a debt). The movie is grisly and its sense of humor is mordant, but it winds up communicating a heartbreak that\u2019s pretty straightforward, all things considered.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Fire at Sea", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "This Italian documentary is the official submission from that country for the next Academy Awards. The reaction to this from certain Italian fiction filmmakers has been not unlike the consternation certain novelists have expressed about Bob Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. But, Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s soreness notwithstanding, this is a pertinent gesture, one of self-criticism, even. For \u201cFire at Sea,\u201d in a sense, chronicles an Italian failure. An Italian failure that is, arguably, shared by the rest of the Western world. Advertisement Lampedusa is, per Wikipedia, the largest island of the Pelagie Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. Its closeness to Libya makes it a relatively desirable landing point for African and North African refugees fleeing from wars, unrest, and starvation on that continent. \u201cRelatively\u201d desirable because, as the movie shows in patiently unfolded detail, there\u2019s really very little upside to being a refugee.  Directed by Gianfranco Rosi, the movie begins with a text that reels off some numbers: 400,000 migrants, 15,000 deaths. Such big numbers are hard to see as anything but abstractions. Rosi then cuts to some beautiful, peaceful imagery. Giant radio antennas revolve in front of a dramatic sky full of grey clouds over an undulating sea. A radio DJ says some calming words. It doesn\u2019t seem like a deadly environment.  The movie doesn\u2019t use any narration; the opening text is all the hand-holding the viewer gets. Rosi instead homes his camera on narratives pertaining at first to the natives of the island. A compassionate doctor is seen treating patients who clearly aren\u2019t locals. He bemoans the indignities they suffer, and their deaths. A young boy, a neighbor of the doctor, makes slingshots using medical rubber bands and takes them to a local field to shoot with his pals. Soon there are shots of choppers and a boat. The latest batch of migrants is here.  \u201cThey\u2019re drenched in diesel,\u201d one coastal patrol worker says, examining a few people who have come off a boat. \u201cIf I flicked a cigarette lighter in here the whole room would go up.\u201d The underfed migrants, who mostly look down at their feet as they meet the people into whose hands they\u2019ve placed their fates, grow voluble after a while. In a holding cell, one of them speak-sings of his journey here, from Nigeria. \u201cWe drank our piss to survive,\u201d he wails, both proud and miserable. The doctor continues treating these folks, one by one. The young boy, Samuele, is diagnosed with lazy eye and wanders around with an eyepatch. The sea is always there, ready to deliver new shipments of humanity. Advertisement Rosi\u2019s film is thoughtful and well-constructed. It doesn\u2019t strive for the epic feel of Visconti\u2019s \u201cLa terra trema,\u201d the 1948 epic about Sicilian fisherman that\u2019s been an inescapable influence on Italian film. Its intimacy is a boon. But as laudable as the movie is, it does not quite achieve greatness. That\u2019s the fault of both its indirectness and its obviousness. The portrayals of life in Lampedusa that don\u2019t touch on the migrant crisis have a distance from the subject matter that seems a little besides the point at times. As for obviousness, there\u2019s a scene in which Samuele and his friend are in a field using their new slingshots to shoot projectiles at cactus plants. After doing considerable damage to one of the plants, Samuele tries to make up for it by putting a mutilated plant back together using electrical tape. As they used to say in The New Yorker, \u201cblock that metaphor!\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Dark Tower", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\u201cThe man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\u201d With that great opening line, an obsession began for millions of readers of Stephen King\u2019s series of books that would eventually be known as The Dark Tower. The first book was actually called The Gunslinger, and it was a relatively small volume of brilliant sci-fi/fantasy that used iconic imagery to begin the crafting of a world that would become as rich as those created by George R. R. Martin or J.R.R Tolkien. Over the next few books\u2014The Drawing of the Three, The Wastelands, and Wizard and Glass\u2014King did some of his best writing (the series would actually stretch to seven books and a series of comics, but it\u2019s the initial quartet that holds a special place in my heart). I only mention all of this to place the failure of the long-delayed \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d in the right perspective: this isn\u2019t just a mediocre movie\u2014although it is most definitely that\u2014it is a wasted opportunity to fulfill the promise of that opening line from 35 years ago.  Advertisement Plagued by reshoots and dogged by rumors of poor test screenings, \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d once looked like it would be one of the more notable failures of 2017. Honestly, I kind of wish it was. As is, it\u2019s more forgettable than loathsome, the kind of movie that occasionally rubs salt in your wounds by reminding you what could have been, but mostly just dissipates from memory as it's playing. The two leads here\u2014Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey\u2014work just fine in these iconic roles, and you just want to pick them up and put them in a better movie, one that doesn\u2019t seem stuck in the valley between trying to satisfy hardcore fans of the series and the moviegoers who have never heard of Roland and Walter. By trying to do both, the movie ends up doing neither. The problems start immediately. Someone probably thought that making Roland, the title character of the first book, the lead of the first film wouldn\u2019t satisfy a wide enough demographic. And Hollywood is obsessed with stories of teenagers who discover their bad dreams or hidden secrets are actually the keys to the salvation of the universe. So, instead of the origin story of Roland (which will apparently now be told in a television series, also starring Elba), our protagonist here is really Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor), an essential character in the books reimagined here as a troubled New York teen without much of a real personality. As with almost everyone in this film, he\u2019s a device, a way to push the exposition forward to meet a contractually-mandated running time.  Here\u2019s what we learn about the movie version of Jake, who is basically like the kid reading \"The Neverending Story\" in that he constantly tries to explain to the audience what's going on. Jake has prophetic visions of both the Gunslinger Roland (Elba) and the Man in Black Walter (McConaughey). He also has visions of a massive tower, which we learn is basically keeping the order of the universe. Walter wants to destroy this tower, and he knows that there\u2019s a child out there with the power to help him do so. Of course, that child is Jake, who it turns out has the same power as the young man at the center of \u201cThe Shining.\u201d He can read minds and other such things that Walter will harness to blow up the tower. \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d is filled with references for King nuts, including, among others, a moment where Roland glances behind a pin-up poster while looking for an exit (\u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d) and the numbers \u201c1408\u201d above a portal. Did I mention the portals? I got distracted. It\u2019s easy to do so with this movie. Advertisement Roland, Walter, and eventually Jake cross between worlds through portals. It\u2019s not long before Jake and Roland team up, but Jake questions whether or not his new gun-toting pal is going to help him save the tower or if he just wants vengeance against the man in black. A few other characters flit around the fringe of this thin piece of storytelling, but it\u2019s essentially a three-character piece. And two of those characters are actually pretty well defined. Elba brings a nice gravity to Roland that fits the character well, a combination of a man haunted by the ghosts of his past and driven to do what\u2019s right to avenge them. And McConaughey dances on the edge of hamming it up in the villain role, reining it in just enough that one can see how well he could have been utilized with a better script and vision for the project. Because that\u2019s where this tower crumbles. \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d is hollow. It is soulless. It is a film that never quite figured out what it wanted to be, and so elected to be nothing much at all. Worst of all, it\u2019s clearly been chopped up by those reported reshoots and test screening edits. There\u2019s a scene with a demon in a house that just ends and much of the final act material features a Jake who looks a lot closer to puberty than when the movie began. Weird humorous bits feel like they have been spliced in, trying to find as big an audience as possible. And while some may criticize Stephen King\u2019s more populist works, that\u2019s a charge that could never be lobbied at The Dark Tower. These books had vision. They created worlds. They used iconic imagery to explore timeless themes. \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d plays it so safe and takes so few risks that its greatest sin is in being the one thing those formative books never were for so many people: forgettable.", "Critic": "Beta"}

{"Title": "Mr. Peabody & Sherman", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "I'm not convinced that the world really needed a big budget, 3-D, feature-length reboot of the adventures of Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman, but here it is. \u00a0It's better than OK, and a few elements sing; but overall it frustrates. Its delights come from its willingness to depart from formula, but formula still rules it.  The picture is based on the classic Jay Ward shorts that used to appear on Rocky and Bullwinkle's animated variety show, back during TV's late jurassic period. The film's director Rob Minkoff (\"The Lion King\") and his screenwriter Craig Wright (\"Lost\") don't knock themselves out trying to replicate every nuance. They've kept the central relationship between a genius dog (Ty Burrell) and his adopted human son (Max Charles), plus the time machine they travel in, and a few of Mr. Peabody's brazenly horrible puns (at one point the pooch tells his boy that Egypt's pyramids were designed by \"some old Giza\"). Everything else, though, has been ginned up, seemingly to bring \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" in line with American studio animation's unofficial house style. I'm referring to a familiar set of qualities developed during the Disney renaissance of the late '80s and early '90s, and perfected, if that is the word, by the \"Shrek\" series, and movies in a \"Shrek\"-like vein. Advertisement On Ward's series, the draughtsmanship was simple, and the characters were so barely-animated that they seemed to slide across the screen, like figures in a pop-up book. This movie, in contrast, goes for the glitzy, the state-of-the-art. The designs are highly stylized, but with incongruous elements. The realistic shadings and blockbuster action-film-style (virtual) camerawork seem at odds with the movie's Eisenhower-Kennedy era cars, clothes, hairstyles and architecture; ditto the characters with their Ward-style bobble-heads and sticklike bodies and arms. When Danny Elfman's sprightly-bombastic score swells and Mr. Peabody and Sherman zoom through snaky time-space wormholes a la \"Star Trek\" or \"Contact,\" or race out of a collapsing tomb, or body surf through a network of sewer tunnels just ahead of raging flood waters or flame-clouds, it's as if rather slight source material had been injected with a hyper-dose of steroids that made it balloon grotesquely, creating bulges where bulges shouldn't be.\u00a0 The humor seems off as well. The original show had a distinctively goofy and wry sensibility. It mixed historical factoids and Borscht Belt tomfoolery, with Mr. Peabody educating his boy Sherman on the culture and history of whatever society they happened to be disrupting, then getting them out of jams via Sherlock Holmes-style displays of icy super-competence. There's a fair bit of that in here, and it's marvelous. Peabody's math-driven approach to travel and escape is visualized with onscreen graphics, arrows and equations, and\u00a0the name of Mr. Peabody's fancy mixed drink \"Einstein on the Beach\" is funny on at least two levels. It's hard to imagine how Ty Burrell's vocal performance as Peabody could be improved. Everything about it is exquisitely judged, from the way he sprints through Peabody's scientific exposition, but never so quickly that he confuses the viewer, to the way he unveils the dog's wretched puns (in Peabody's mind, he's underplaying the jokes, but to anyone listening, he's hammering them).\u00a0 Considering that the movie's\u00a0subtlest achievements are its most impressive, it's too bad that \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" felt obligated to be \"awesome\" every single second. \u00a0As \"The Lego Movie\" taught us, \"awesome\" has become a code word that means, \"Let's collectively agree to pretend this isn't the same old thing we always experience, so that we don't feel sad and cheated.\"\u00a0The problem isn't that the film is badly executed (by every current industry yardstick, it's aces) but that the filmmakers have taken something uncategorizable and revised in ways that make it more like everything else in multiplexes. The noise and scale mean that Ward's characters have to fight to seem charming and special, even though in quiet scenes you never question their charming specialness. \u00a0 Advertisement The film also displays a puzzling tone-deafness towards other eras and cultures, and towards women and girls. An early action sequence set in Egypt is visually splendid and has an agreeable \"History of the World, Part 1\" silliness (Mel Brooks makes the connection official with a vocal cameo later in the film, as Sigmund Freud). It's capped by a magnificently absurd routine in which the hero impersonates a god. But this same sequence trades in white-girl-imperiled-by-creepy-brown-men images. It also digs the film deeper into a sexist pit that I hoped it wouldn't fall into, even though the warning signs appear early. Sherman's classmate and academic rival Penny Peterson (Ariel Winter) is nothing more than a grade-school version of Tracy Flick from \"Election,\" prideful and spiteful and shallow where Sherman is humble, considerate and soulful. \u00a0When she goes to Peabody and Sherman's house with her parents, she becomes an even more irritating character, losing the grating competitiveness that made her dynamic as well as unlikable. She manipulates Peabody into showing her Sherman's time machine (against daddy dog's instructions) then gets kidnapped by the boy version of King Tut, mesmerized by his wealth, lured into marriage and prepped for sacrifice. She's just another annoying, self-involved chick causing problems for a lovable dude.\u00a0 This is par for the gender-relations course in \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman.\" None of the other women in the movie\u2014including Penny's mom (voiced by Leslie Mann) and the plump spinster guidance counselor Miss Grunion (Allison Janney)\u2014rise above mere shrew or foil. A sequence set in Egypt that finds Peabody, Sherman and Penny cavorting with Leonardo DaVinci (Stanley Tucci) makes the film's subordination of women official. Penny launches Leonardo's flying machine (against Sherman's wishes; notice the pattern?), but rather than revel in her ability to make action happen, the sequence has Penny turn over the mechanical bird's controls to Sherman, whom she delightedly describes as the first man ever to take flight. Advertisement The film's attempts to create \"heart\" are problematic, too, though understandable. Over the past 25 years, Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks and pretty much every other studio that makes animated films have made us expect a blend of slapstick, buddy comedy and overscaled action, and maybe a song or two if it's a musical, with a bit of hugging and learning, all wrapped up in a heart-shaped bow. \u00a0The filmmakers might have worried that they couldn't sustain a Jay Ward-style cool farce for 75 minutes, even an animated one\u2014that viewers of all ages, conditioned by so many other animated pictures, would demand that their heartstrings be tugged regularly.\u00a0Thus Peabody and Sherman's relationship, which remained largely unexplained in the TV series and was more amusing for being undefined, is here transformed into a half-baked parable of social difference, with Peabody, the dog raising an orphaned human, perhaps standing in for a single or gay or unacceptably metrosexual dad, or maybe an adoptive parent of a different race. (In a flashback sequence, an African-American judge, voiced by Dennis Haysbert, grants Peabody custody of the foundling child.)\u00a0 If the movie had gone all the way with this notion and converted subtext into text, it might have distinguished itself as a total re-imagining of its source, rather than a mildly eccentric version of the same-old, same-old. It's a bit of a shame, really. \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" is a sweet movie, funny and essentially decent. But its failure to avoid the imaginative failures and regressive messages that plague so many other feature-length cartoons make it more disappointing, somehow, than more crass, mechanical film might have been. The eccentric touches give you hope for the movie. The movie dashes them.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Dolphin Tale 2", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Dolphin Tale\" told the extraordinary true story of Winter, a dolphin with an injured tail, saved by the groundbreaking use of a flexible prosthetic tail built to the contours of her body. The tail allowed her to continue to flourish at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, whose dedicated team of marine biologists and animal rescue specialists devote their lives to helping injured marine life. Director Charles Martin Smith told Winter's story with respect, warmth and care, soft-pedaling any impulse towards anthropomorphism. A sequel might seem unnecessary (except for the fact that \"Dolphin Tale\" was such a huge hit.) But Smith, who directed and wrote \"Dolphin Tale 2\", has assembled the same cast of characters (including the actual Winter, who plays herself in both movies), and has created another sensitive and well-observed story about life in the marina, human and animal. The strengths of the first film are here as well. \"Dolphin Tale 2\" cares about the right things: the details of marine rescue, the dedication of the individuals involved, and the lives and personalities of the animals under their care. \"Dolphin Tale 2\" tries to do too much, with too many stories shoehorned in, but the overall effect is emotional and sweet. Advertisement Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick, Jr.) started the Clearwater Marine Aquarium with the motto: \"Rescue. Rehab. Release.\" Winter's success story helped make CMA famous and profitable, which we now see, in \"Dolphin Tale 2\" is a blessing and a curse. Winter is big business for the marina and financial decisions start to override the health and well-being of the animals. Sawyer (Nathan Gamble), the young shy boy who bonded with Winter in the first film, is now a teenager, and trains the volunteer staff at the marina. His bond with Winter has helped him understand what he wants to do with his life. Clay's daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) works at the marina too, and she and Sawyer are still good friends, but maybe puberty has brought something else to the surface. Kris Kristofferson returns as Dr. Clay's father, Ashley Judd as Sawyer's mother, and Morgan Freeman as the thinking-outside-of-the-box prosthetic limb designer, Dr. Cameron McCarthy. Even the feisty obnoxious pelican Rufus has returned, still terrorizing the visitors to the marina. (At the screening I went to, populated mostly by children under the age of 10, Rufus was a huge hit.) Winter is in trouble again. Her companion dolphin died of old age. Dolphins are social animals and it is against USDA regulation to have a dolphin alone in a tank. Dr. Clay is written up for a violation. An injured baby dolphin, found stranded and sunburned on a sandbar, has been brought to the marina, and the hope is that she can be introduced to Winter's tank. Will Winter accept her? Will the baby dolphin be freaked out by the prosthetic? If the \"introduction\" doesn't go well, then Winter's future is in jeopardy. She may die, or be moved to another facility. The financial investors in the marina put pressure on Dr. Clay to make this friendship between dolphins happen, because Winter is a cash cow. But Winter is under no obligation to comply with the ridiculous needs of humans. If she doesn't like the baby interloper, she doesn't like her. There are other issues to consider: If the baby dolphin recovers completely, then Dr. Clay has an obligation to release her back into the wild. But then what will happen to Winter? Is it time to let Winter go? There are other animals in recovery at the marina, one being a giant yellow sea turtle, found caught in someone's tossed-away fishing line. This is a lot of plot. For the most part, Smith guides us through it simply, letting the heightened emotions take care of themselves. Like the first film, he resists making the animals seem like cuddly stuffed animals with human emotions. Dolphins are highly sophisticated creatures but, as Dr. Clay says to Sawyer and Hazel at one point, \"Winter is not a pet. She's a wild animal.\" \"Dolphin Tale 2\" treats Winter (and all of the other animals we meet) with respect. She is her own thing, she has emotions and thoughts, as all animals do, but they cannot be explained to us, they cannot be revealed. Sawyer is a trusted human in Winter's world. She tweets and beeps at him when she sees him, but still, when she's having a bad day, she won't hesitate to thrash about, knocking him across the face with her hard bottle nose. Advertisement \"Dolphin Tale 2\" works because it immerses us fully in the daily rhythms of the marina. It shows us how things work, down to the most nuts-and-bolts level. Introducing a new dolphin into a tank with another dolphin is almost as elaborate a production as an opera at the Met. It requires all hands on deck. By focusing on the details, Smith helps us understand not only what is happening but the emotional stakes as well. This is no small feat. Schmaltz would be an error with such inherently strong material, and Smith knows it. There are scenes showing the release process, beautifully shot by cinematographer Daryn Okada, where a fully-recovered animal is set free into the Gulf Coast again. People gather on the beach to watch, holding up supportive signs (as though the animals will find strength in reading them), and there are cheers of triumph when a dolphin is seen joining a school out at sea. The score, by Rachel Portman, is elegant and supportive, rather than intrusive and bossy. Harry Connick Jr., as Dr. Clay, is troubled and thoughtful, and also a good leader. There is no doubt who is in charge. On the night the baby dolphin is brought to the marina, via ambulance, he shouts to the crowd of volunteers, \"When that dolphin comes out of the van, the only voice I want to hear is my own.\"\u00a0 It's a very good performance. Nathan Gamble is beautiful in his role, heartbroken that Winter seems to be declining. He is supposed to start looking at colleges but how can he leave Winter?

He does not speak and there is no voice-over narration, so we cannot know what's in his head. But the movie is contemplating, among other things, the fleeting nature of existence\u2014the way that time, to quote \"Life Itself,\" slips through your fingers like a long silk scarf.\u00a0 \"Boyhood\" became the instant subject of media buzz last year when Linklater revealed that he'd been working on the project for 12 years, following the same actors (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as the hero's parents, Olivia and Mason, Sr., and the director's daughter Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha) through the early part of the 21st century. We watch the children grow up and the adults thicken and grey. We see Olivia and Mason, Sr. in various relationships. Olivia is looking to replace her ex-husband and make her \"broken\" family intact again, and this search leads her into a series of arrangements that are wrong for her, sometimes horribly so. Mason, Sr., goes the other way, acting the role of bohemian free-spirit even as he works a series of rather typical jobs. The kids get taller and become interested in particular subjects, and in sex, and after a while they start to think about college and what they want to do with their lives.\u00a0 Advertisement It's all a blur. The blur is indescribably moving. We've seen people age in movies and on TV programs\u2014the kids in the \"Harry Potter\" and \"Up\" series, for instance, and little Ronny Howard on \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" and Kiernan Shipka on \"Mad Men\"\u2014but we've never seen it happen in such a compact span of screen time. That's what makes \"Boyhood\" singular. There is no other work to which one can directly compare it without distorting pop culture history. This movie is truly its own thing, as eccentrically unique as Linklater's breakthrough \"Slacker,\" another Austin-set feature to which \"Boyhood\" feels (curiously) like a companion piece, or perhaps a bookend. Mason is a child of divorce. He and his mother and his sister move around a lot, all over Texas, a U.S. state as big as France. Mason's dad does not have custody, so has to accommodate his wife's shifts in geography over the years, sometimes driving hundreds of miles to see his children. \u00a0Even though Olivia and Mason, Jr. love their kids, there are moments when they resent them, because once they had them they were locked into a particular track and had to put their kids first, always. The trick, though\u2014and this is where Linklater the writer shows how generous and kind he is\u2014lies in realizing that sometimes when parents think they're putting their kids first they're really responding to conditioning, or doing what their society or their gender or their parents told them was the correct thing to do. The movie's about social conditioning as well as time. It asks basic, deep questions. What makes us \"normal\"? Is there such a thing as \"normal\"? What makes us identify as men, as women, as children? Is the traditional domestic arrangement\u2014a wife, a husband and kids living in the same house\u2014really desirable for every person, and genuinely good for society, or does it inflict distress on those whose personalities and desires cannot function within it? Two important men in Olivia's life have drinking problems; alcoholism is a disease, but it's also a means of forgetting, of numbing pain, of denial. \u00a0Do we really change over time? Can we decide to change ourselves? Or is free will an illusion? \u00a0Do we seize moments or do moments seize us? (\"You are responsible for your own actions,\" warns a sign hanging in the hero's elementary school.)\u00a0 Advertisement Olivia seems, like many single moms, dispirited by the the responsibilities she bears. Early on we hear her arguing with her boyfriend, a single man who resents that she can't just come and go as she pleases, as he does. (\"I was somebody's daughter, and then I was somebody's fucking mother,\" she says.) She's chasing an idea of normalcy that may not be right for her. In an intense scene that occurs in a car outside of a school, not long after a period of domestic strife, Olivia asks for understanding because she's trying to build \"a family\" with a new boyfriend, and Mason exclaims, \"We already have a family!\"\u2014and he's right. Olivia is a college professor and a liberal feminist, but she's still bought into the husband-and-wife-and-two-kids-equals-a-real-family thing. She studies \"unconditioned response\" in one of her grad school courses but it takes a few years for her to figure out, in practical terms, what the phrase means. There are points near the end of \"Boyhood\" when\u00a0Olivia might remind you of George Bailey, the hero of \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" Of the movie's two parents, she is nearly always the responsible one\u2014the \"boring\" one. Even her worst decisions were made for noble reasons, but the constraints that motherhood placed on her freedom always gnawed at her. Over time, though, she grows by leaps and bounds, finishing grad school and becoming a teacher and then a person of considerable influence in her community. We start to see the profound, lasting impact that her moral rectitude has had on the world. She evolves, as surely as her ex-husband and children evolve, but the process is subtler. It's not right out there, like her ex-husband's delayed maturation. The film's title and choice of protagonist have been criticized (gently but firmly) for unthinkingly confirming that heterosexual men are at the center of the universe. But this reading ignores the movie's constant (if empathetic) critique of American manhood, or what passes for American manhood: an entitled mental state that is really just boyhood with money and a driver's license. Mason, Sr., for all the love that he shows his kids, is an example of this. He's a great natural playmate for his son and daughter, joining them on the floor as they futz with toys and taking them on camping trips and trying to purchase their love with gifts as if every visitation were a miniature Christmas. But he doesn't express much real wisdom until his kids edge toward adolescence and become tight-lipped and undemonstrative, and he pulls the car over during a family trip to demand that they have real conversations (amusingly, Samantha makes the same request of him). \u00a0 Advertisement He has to learn to give in as well as to give\u2014and that giving in doesn't always have to mean giving up.\u00a0Even when Mason, Sr. is 30 or 40 he still lives like a 19-year old who just got his first place. He resents his ex-wife as a killjoy, and clings to his GTO the way little boys cling to their loveys. And yet\u00a0he matures onscreen along with his kids, mellowing over the years and becoming less strident and arrogant and more generous, learning that it's possible to be a person of integrity even if you aren't insisting that every single thing go your way at every single moment (a pattern of behavior that only narcissists mistake for freedom).\u00a0We get the sense that in some ways Mason the elder is un-learning what he learned during the first part of his life\u2014an experience that his kids are now going through, with different details. It's rough, this process. It's emotional boot camp, with versions of hazing. And I love how \"Boyhood\" admits that, in certain ways, growing up stinks. Every character has a least one moment in which they have to heed the advice of Corinthians and put away childish things. None of them like it. The adults in Mason, Jr.'s orbit (including his mother and father and various teachers and authority figures) all want to parent or mentor him by turning him into reflections or extensions of themselves. In high school, a photography teacher tells the budding shutterbug hero that he needs to move away from arty compositions and learn to shoot sports so that he can make a living, advice which assumes that Mason, Jr. wants to earn a living with photography rather than treating it as an avocation, or as the visual version of a diary. The manager of a restaurant where Mason, Jr. works as a dishwasher wants to groom him as a fry cook. The man's eyes light up as he describes this arc, as if he's moved by his own generosity. At various points during the boy's life he's pushed toward bad decisions by other boys who warn him that failure to act a certain way makes him a \"fag\" or a \"pussy.\" You sense the kid pushing back against these pressures. You realize that, for all their faults, and despite the geographical and emotional obstacles that they were up against, his parents did a good job raising him. Or maybe he absorbed their better qualities as if by osmosis. (Did he seize their better qualities, or did their better qualities seize him?) Linklater doesn't explain any of this\u2014the storytelling and filmmaking are intuitive; things that look like pointers or labels aren't\u2014and yet it's all there in the movie. You can feel it. Perhaps without meaning to, the film exemplifies the best piece of advice that anyone gives the hero: \"We're all just winging it.\" Advertisement \"Boyhood\" is broken into discrete dramatic chunks\u2014this is really an anthology of short movies with a recurring cast\u2014and there are no timestamps telling us that we've passed from 2002 into 2003 or from 2009 into 2010. We realize where we are on the timeline when we hear somebody talking about the Iraq war, or hear a song on the soundtrack that was big during a certain year, or realize that the boy has changed his haircut or gotten a little bit taller. The simultaneously nourishing and corrosive effects of time make the film quietly moving and humble-seeming, despite its three-hour length and conceptual audacity. Time is what makes the film cohere even when particular scenes, images or performances seem clunky or undernourished. Fixating on imperfections while discussing \"Boyhood\" would be as petty as criticizing the sculpting of individual stones in a cathedral.\u00a0The totality matters. Even more important is our recognition that the totality is as fleeting as life.\u00a0 Time, and our interaction with time, and the way in which we are all ultimately overmatched and worn down by time, and the notion of cinema as a means of sculpting with time: these and other aspects of temporality are at the heart of \"Boyhood.\" Time is the core around which all of this movie's musings on childhood and parenthood are woven. It's the river down which the scenes and characters travel without consciously realizing that they are on individual journeys that all have the same ending. If life is \"about\" anything, it's about realizing and accepting that fact: that everything is fleeting. Time gives birth and nourishes and then obliterates as it moves ahead, like the family which, in an early scene, prepares to move out of a house by covering murals and hand-lettered height charts with white paint. The film ends and the credits come up and you ask the same question that you ask at the end of an evening spent with old, dear friends: where did the time go?", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Prisoners", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Kidnapping thrillers often lull us into a sense of safety in the opening sequences, showing the normal rhythms of life that will soon be shattered. Denis Villeneuve's \"Prisoners\" does not go that route. It opens with a shot of a snowy forest, where a deer quietly noses around for food. Into the frame comes the barrel of a shotgun. We hear a prayer being intoned. Boom, the deer goes down.\u00a0The camera pulls back to show a father (Hugh Jackman) and teenage son (Dylan Minnette), in day-glo hunting gear staring at their kill through the ranks of bare trees. On the drive home, the father, who seems humorless, intense, and a bit of a bore, lectures the son on how to always be prepared for the worst in life.\u00a0 Advertisement This opening is so heavy-handed that it's amazing that the film doesn't instantly collapse under its symbolic weight. Shot by the great Roger Deakins, regular cinematographer for the Coen brothers, the movie is drenched in rain and drained of color. Aspects of \"Prisoners\" are effective, but for the most part it's rather ridiculous (despite the fact that it clearly wants to be taken super-seriously), and there's an overwrought quality to much of the acting. Keller Dover (Jackman) is an independent contractor who lives with his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and two kids in a suburban neighborhood. He loves Bruce Springsteen, \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" hunting, and hoarding canned goods, gas masks, and survivalist gadgets in his basement. On Thanksgiving, the Dovers go to dinner with a neighboring family, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis), who have two kids the same age. While the parents drink wine and talk in the living room, the two little girls ask if they can take a walk. It is a walk from which they do not return. Panic ensues, especially when it becomes clear that a creepy RV, which had been seen parked in the neighborhood earlier, has vanished. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case. The RV's owner, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), is dragged in for questioning. Forensics say the RV is clean of physical evidence, but Alex is strange. he speaks in a whispery high voice that makes him sound like a pre-teen. It is not inconceivable to think that he may be hiding something. This is clearly Dover's take, and he and Loki immediately start to butt heads about the course of the investigation. When Jones is released due to lack of evidence (into the custody of his aunt, played by Melissa Leo), Dover takes matters into his own hands, kidnapping Jones, and holding him hostage in an abandoned dilapidated building. Dover loops in Franklin Birch on his plan to beat the truth out of Jones. Birch is horrified at the sight of Jones tied to a sink, but he ignores his own moral compass in the face of Dover's furious certainty. This is one of the subtler points of the script: how certainty can override doubt with sheer force, and how doubt is often essential to maintaining our humanity. \u00a0 Hugh Jackman huffs and puffs and screams and roars throughout the film, and it becomes monotonous, but what all that behavior tells us is that this is a weak man who needs to feel powerful. In one telling moment, while murmuring the \"Our Father,\" he is unable to say \"as we forgive those who trespass against us.\" He has a veritable arsenal in his basement, his family could withstand a mustard gas attack as well as the Zombie Apocalypse, but he couldn't protect his daughter on a simple walk through a safe neighborhood. And he's so convinced that Alex Jones is the guy that he is blind to other possibilities. Meanwhile, his wife lies in bed, tranquilizing herself into a stupor. Advertisement Gyllenhaal is great here in a role that must have looked rather uninteresting on the page.\u00a0Aaron Guzikowski's script, so packed with religious symbols that verges on a sermon, is excellent in its spare and compelling portrait of Loki. The only image of the character outside the context of his job is his introductory scene, eating Thanksgiving dinner in an empty, fluorescent-lit Chinese restaurant as the rain batters down outside. The only thing we learn about his past is that he was in a boys' home and was raised in foster care. His knuckles and neck are sprinkled with tattoos, including a cross on one thumb. He's got a facial tic. We meet a lot of creeps in \"Prisoners\", and you get the sense that Detective Loki could have been one of them if he hadn't become a cop. It's a nice performance from Gyllenhaal, and its subtlety is welcome considering all the teeth gnashing going on in other performances. Director Villeneuve gives us a couple of truly suspenseful scenes. One is a chase through the nighttime back yards of the neighborhood after a candlelight vigil for the two girls. The interiors of the houses seem gloomy and cramped, with walls cutting into the frame and characters coming in and out of sight: a visual correlative for the idea of people cut off from one another. But as the plot goes into high gear and we get other suspects, basement lairs and a glimpse of vast conspiracies, \"Prisoners\" wears out its welcome.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Gimme Shelter", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Gimme Shelter\" starts with a lot of promise. We see shots of a gritty New York not often seen in films today: rattling above-ground subway lines, tenements, dank hallways filled with noise and chaos. Over the urban landscape shots, we hear a whispering female voice, \"I'm not scared. I can do this. I'm okay.\" Vanessa Hudgens, fully separated now from her \"High School Musical\" persona, having taken gritty almost feral roles in \"Sucker Punch,\" \"Spring Breakers,\" and \"Frozen Ground\", stands in a cramped bathroom, chopping off her black hair, whispering those words to herself. Her words will come up again as her character, Apple, makes a run for it, out of the life handed to her, into a life she created. Advertisement \"Gimme Shelter\" has an episodic structure that gives a monotonous \"and then this happened, and then this happened\" feel to all of the hardships that Apple encounters. There are car crashes and locked shelter doors, uncomprehending social workers and screaming families. Father McCarthy, a\u00a0kindly priest played by James Earl Jones, hovers around Apple, shining his benign light.\u00a0 Based on a true story, \"Gimme Shelter\" ultimately is about the work of Kathy DiFiore, who created Christian shelters for pregnant teens who want to keep their babies. The scenes of Apple in the shelter all the other pregnant girls are the film's best, but the shelter doesn't appear until halfway through, Krauss having decided for some reason to hold it back. What this does is it makes the shelter seem like a sub-plot, or another \"and then this happened\" episode, when it is actually the point of the whole thing.  Aside from James Earl Jones and a baffled and uptight Brendan Fraser, Vanessa Hudgens is the only \"name\" in the film. She is in every scene. She carries the action. Like the famous \"women's pictures\" in the 1940s, \"Gimme Shelter\" is interested in the up-and-down journey of its lead female character: her struggles and triumphs, failures and flaws. Every detail here is right. The piercings on Apple's nose and lips look infected, her skin is blotched and pimply, and when she gets a chance to eat, she shovels the food in her mouth like a wild animal. Apple has been \"in the system\" since her earliest days, she has been abused and raped and molested, and the \"system\" kept shoving her back into the pit. Her mother, played by an almost-unrecognizable Rosario Dawson, was \"born in the streets\", she has rotting yellow teeth, bruises on her legs. The \"system\" keeps trying to re-unite Apple with her mother, against Apple's clear wishes. But Apple is still a minor.  In the opening scenes of the film, Apple escapes from her mother's clutches and makes her way to New Jersey to track down the man who is her biological father (Brendan Fraser), a man she has never met. The man now lives in a Daddy Warbucks-level mansion with his wife (Stephanie Szostak) and two kids, and they try to adjust to the advent of Apple, who is rude and sullen, with atrocious table manners. When it becomes obvious that Apple is pregnant, Mrs. Daddy Warbucks takes her to a clinic to get an abortion. Apple stares at the ultrasound pictures, deciding whether she wants to keep the baby. She needs shelter, of course. Advertisement Kathy DiFiore is a character in the film. She's played by Ann Dowd, in a powerful and compassionate performance that doesn't look like acting. She seems like a real person. \u00a0She has a sense of mission towards the unborn babies under her care, as well as to the girls who live in her house. The girls in these scenes are wonderful, anonymous, they seem to have stepped right off the streets. Their interactions feel improvisational and fresh.While there is some bickering, none of it gets too harsh. For the most part it is a supportive family atmosphere.\u00a0 The couple of scenes between Dawson and Hudgens vibrate with pain and ugliness. The script is often obvious, with all feelings laid out too cleanly, but both actresses still manage to create a jagged relationship based on their characters' codependence and shared traumas. One of the film's strengths is its portrayal of the \"system\" and what it does to abused children, and the layers of bureaucracy that make it hard to bring about meaningful change in people's lives.  There's a reason the Christian media has been following this film closely. The religious aspect of \"Gimme Shelter\" is right out on the table, once the kindly priest shows up, but it's undercut by the grubby and warm reality of those girls in the shelter. There are some scenes where the girls grumble to one another at being made to collect donations in local churches, and be trotted out as success stories of living in the light of Jesus. The film never says the words \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice.\" It genuinely seems to be about how the system has broken down entirely, and how sometimes it is up to privately funded charities to provide a light at the end of the tunnel.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Biography cannot explain talent. Knowing a person's childhood details and early life may be interesting, but it does not (and cannot) illuminate the talent itself. Some piece will always be missing.\u00a0This seems to be the attitude that Sophie Huber has taken in her meditative documentary, \"Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction,\" about the great American actor.\u00a0 Stanton is 86 years old. He is still working. He has been in over 200 films, and even he doesn't know the exact number. He was born in Kentucky. Beyond that, we don't get much from him. He fought in the Battle of Okinawa. He was maybe married for two weeks once, he's not sure now. Sophie Huber is faced with a wall of gentle resistance to her questions. Advertisement And yet, as he does in his roles, Stanton opens himself up to the camera in a way that has the indelible stamp of truth, an almost fragile sense of honesty. At one point, in his car, he says to Huber off-camera, \"I don't want any lines. How 'bout doing nothing? How 'bout silence?\" Although the film is filled with talk and music, it is the silence that opens up our understanding. Rainer Maria Rilke wrote, \u201cDo not now seek the answers... Live the questions now...\u201d Harry Dean Stanton, reserved, elusive, carries around his solitude with him wherever he goes. He is a man who \"lives the questions\". The answers are irrelevant\u2014to Stanton, and to this film. Harry Dean Stanton: Party Fiction\" takes a dreamy and philosophical approach, reflecting the personality of the man who is its subject. It is partly a day-in-the-life-of-Harry-Dean.\u00a0We drive around the empty night streets of Los Angeles with him, we go hang out at a bar on Santa Monica Boulevard, where he has been a regular for 40 years. There are brief but fascinating interviews with colleagues and friends, Wim Wenders, Sam Shepard, Kris Kristofferson, Debbie Harry. There's a wonderful scene where David Lynch reads questions to Stanton about his life from a piece of paper. Clips from Stanton's movies are, surprisingly, few and far between, and seem relegated to the films discussed by those interviewed.\u00a0 Interspersed throughout is footage of present-day Harry Dean Stanton sitting in his Los Angeles home, singing the songs that he loves, country-western tunes, Mexican songs, \"Danny Boy\". When he sings, he is lost to everything but the music. In an illuminating moment later with Kristofferson, Stanton expresses regret that he didn't pursue singing seriously. At first, it seems that the songs are there to add nuance to our image of Stanton, but by the end, we've heard him sing five or six songs in total, and Huber clearly finds Stanton's love of music and his openness while singing a key that accesses us to Stanton's inner world. Advertisement Stanton had been working for 30 years as a character actor before he got his first lead role, as the man who appears from out of the desert in Wim Wenders' \"Paris, Texas\". He usually plays outsiders, loners, drifters: men on the outskirts of the cultural norm. His one brief scene in Monte Hellman's \"Two-Lane Blacktop\", as the lonely gay hitchhiker who puts a hand on Warren Oates' knee, is tragic, and he has less than five minutes to establish an entire story for his character. But that is just one example from hundreds. David Lynch speaks of Stanton's \"innocence\", which remains intact despite his age and experience. Perhaps his career of playing outsiders is partly an accident of genetics: his face is one of the most memorable in cinema, etched with lines and deep crevices. Sam Shepard says, \"He's one of those actors who knows that his face is the story.\" Stanton's eyes always seem to be looking at a horizon, either actual or interior. He is powerfully elsewhere. Pain wells up in him easily, coming in a breath, a pause. He does his work simply, with no fanfare. To quote Katharine Hepburn on John Wayne: \"He is a very very good actor in the most highbrow sense of the word. You don\u2019t catch him at it.\"  Stanton admits that he has always been \"a loner\", and yet he has maintained friendships over the course of his life. He and Jack Nicholson are very close. Stanton tells of his friendship with Marlon Brando, the long phone calls they would have in the last three years of Brando's life. Stanton has no sense of self-importance, or awareness of his status. When David Lynch asks Stanton how he would like to be remembered, Stanton replies, \"It doesn't matter.\" You believe him.\u00a0 One of the problems for actors who make it look so easy is that they are taken for granted, by the industry and by audiences alike. Stanton has not been nominated for any major awards. He has remained under the radar for nearly 60 years. It seems he likes it that way, but his assistant, Logan Sparks, adds a refreshing contradictory opinion. Sparks says, of Stanton, \"He always says 'Do nothing'. If he actually 'did nothing', he'd still be sitting in a rocking chair in Kentucky.\" It's a fair point. People may drift into one or two good roles, or a good five-year run of movies. One does not \"drift\" into a 60-year-long career. It takes gumption, ambition, and commitment, all words that seem anathema to Stanton.  When Harry Dean Stanton was fourteen years old, he was home alone, and he became so conscious of \"the void\", of the nothing-ness at the heart of existence, that he called up his aunt to \"to see if [he] was still connected.\" Facing the void, or, more accurately, living with the knowledge that the void exists, is at the heart of Harry Dean Stanton's personality, and his work as an actor. Sitting in the back seat of a car during one of his nocturnal jaunts through Los Angeles, he mentions that when he thinks of how fast the earth is going around the sun it makes him nervous, because \"there isn't anything I can do about it.\" He looks out at the dreamy nightscape of Los Angeles from Mulholland Drive and muses that all of this is temporary, the universe will end someday, death is a part of life. \"And that's not a negative concept,\" he says. \"It's just what is. It's liberating.\"  Advertisement Shot beautifully by Seamus McGarvey, \"Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction\" is a compelling collage of a man who has been ubiquitous in American films for over half a century and is still with us, still working, still staring out at that horizon. The film takes its title from the Kris Kristofferson song \"He's a Pilgrim\", which could be said to describe Stanton:  \"He's a poet, he's a pickerHe's a prophet, he's a pusherHe's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned.He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.\"", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Band Aid", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Most of us know couples who seem to barely tolerate one another; who roll their eyes while their partner is talking; who simmer with low-level contempt for one another and don't bother to hide it. Whatever valid reason there may be for turning the relationship sour, couples like this are a huge bore. Anna (Zoe Lister-Jones) and Ben (Adam Pally) in \"Band Aid\" are that kind of couple. They show up at events carrying their thunder-cloud with them.\u00a0 One day, at a kids' birthday party, Anna and Ben pick up a plastic microphone and make up a song on the spot, poking fun at themselves and their fights. A small space of communication opens up and they decide to start a band. This is the premise of \"Band Aid,\" written, directed, and produced by Lister-Jones, who also wrote all of the songs performed by the couple in the film. Lister-Jones is the very definition of a \"phenom,\" and if the film sometimes falls back on clich\u00e9, there's enough charm and interest here\u2014particularly in the chemistry between the two leads\u2014to keep it afloat. Advertisement \"Band Aid\" is the story of two disappointed, stuck people who get re-inspired through creating music together. Anna had a book deal once, but it fell through. Now she makes money as an Uber driver. Ben is a freelance artist who designs corporate logos, but really, though, all he does is lie on the couch, smoke weed, and watch television. Their relationship is not on autopilot so much as it has descended into a constant state of increasingly toxic bickering. Their couples therapist informs them that she's moving to Canada, her tone suggesting that the move may be to get away from them. Collaborating requires communication. In the space of songwriting, Anna and Ben find their fights absurd, even entertaining. In that space, they can say anything to each other. All of it is grist for the mill. They rope in their neighbor Dave (Fred Armisen) to be their drummer. He's an extremely strange man (practically the Platonic Ideal of the \"weird neighbor\" sitcom clich\u00e9) but game for the task of keeping the beat for the two maniacs onstage in front of him. Performing at open mic nights creates a sense of togetherness in Anna and Ben in a way that couples therapy never did. Lister-Jones' songs are punk-rock and grunge inspired, with snarky lyrics, screaming choruses, simple chord changes. Pally and Lister-Jones seem to get a legitimate kick out of one another during their duets, and the characters experience a catharsis like no other when they sing together. Lister-Jones celebrates the wild free-fall of that creative space, the embracing of the unknown, saying \"Yes\" to new experiences, the terror of the blank page. Like the wonderful film \"Music and Lyrics,\" \"Band Aid\" shows how creative collaboration\u2014a shared project, something to DO together besides just being a couple\u2014is a great basis for a relationship. Hell, it worked for Richard and Linda Thompson. (Briefly, anyway.) \"Band Aid\" is quite insightful in its observations about the expectations that marriage imposes on couples (couples who buy the conventional lie, that is). You'd think two bohemian types like Anna and Ben could resist succumbing to phony roles such as \"husband,\" \"wife,\" \"breadwinner,\" etc., but no. The institution is too strong. The frustration of the film (possibly inadvertent) is watching two people so readily buy into a life that does not suit them at all. Lister-Jones and Pally have a free-wheeling improvisational chemistry that anchors the film and saves it from sentimentality. In their hands, both Anna and Ben are clearly funny people, even when they're saying terrible things. Pally was so great in a similar two-hander, 2015's \"Night Owls,\" a film that also relied on his ability to listen and react, to create a comedic context for the sometimes extremely serious events in the film. That's a hard line to walk and he does it beautifully. He's wonderful at suggesting that Ben's bratty behavior comes from Ben's baffled response to the Gloomy Gus his wife has become. He doesn't know what to do and so he \"checks out.\" And Lister-Jones' performance illuminates\u2014in every pause, every barb, every scowl\u2014that this is a woman who has not dealt with her traumas and disappointments (real and perceived) in any meaningful way. Pally and Lister-Jones have a \"riff\" dynamic, energy sparking up and deflating, exploding, subsiding, one-liners\u2014funny and cruel\u2014careening out of their mouths. \"Band Aid\" deals with some pretty serious topics, but it doesn't have the raw-wound quality of films like \"Blue Valentine\" or \"The Break-Up,\" two movies that also present the wreckage left behind when love departs the scene. \"Band Aid\" is mostly interested in what happens when two unhappy people sit down with pen and paper and try to create something out of nothing.

{"Title": "Animals", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The thing about drug addicts is that, regardless of their background, ultimately, they are all the same. Anyone who has known a drug addict has looked on helplessly as the individual's personality is co-opted by the addiction, turning the specific narrative of a specific human being into a predictable clich\u00e9. It's devastating for all involved, and onlookers (family and friends) wonder what the hell happened to their sweet daughter, their ambitious son. That's the main challenge with stories about drug addicts: there aren't a million stories to tell, there are only a couple, because the addiction operates like clockwork. Descents into addiction are a favorite topic of films, from \"Lost Weekend\" to \"Panic in Needle Park\" to \"Drugstore Cowboy\" to \"Requiem for a Dream\" ... Such stories can operate as cautionary tales or they can be queasily voyeuristic and sensational. Collin Schiffli's strong directorial debut, \"Animals\", (with a script by David Dastmalchian, who also stars) is neither cautionary nor voyeuristic. It tells the story of a young couple whose only remaining bond is their heroin addiction, and when their drug-scoring schemes start to dry up, reality closes in with all the subtlety of a car crashing into a brick wall at high speed. Advertisement At first, Jude (Dastmalchian) and his girlfriend Bobbie (Kim Shaw), hanging out in Chicago, sleeping in their car, looking for their next fix, seem like an adorable rom-com version of drug addicts. They hold hands as they walk down the street. Bobbie keeps all of her possessions in a child's metal lunch box. They go to the zoo together and look at lions and camels and tigers through the bars of the cage. (The constant animal imagery is on-the-nose in its symbolism, although it does lead to the overwhelming strangeness and beauty of the final shot.) \u00a0Neither of them are in touch with their families anymore. Calling home for help is no longer an option. Their lives have been pared down to such a sterile landscape that there is only room for each other, and for the drugs.\u00a0 This is not a \"slippery slope\" movie, like other stories about addicts. In \"Animals,\" they are already at the bottom \u00a0of the slope. Taking place in a very condensed period of time, \"Animals\" features an alarming (and effective) swerve in mood, from the nearly-bucolic opening sequences, (blinking in the morning light into the camera flares, giggling over a successful con, the glory of the heroin high itself) to a more jagged and terrifying energy in the second half of the film. Bobbie and Jude shoplift CDs and then sell them in order to buy drugs. She pretends to be a sex worker, setting up \"dates\" with random guys through an ad she and Jude placed in the paper. They end up conning a security guard over a fictional stolen laptop in a scam that is so complicated it almost reaches the slam-dunk of Moses and Addie Pray's money trick in \"Paper Moon.\" But the scams get more dangerous. And without constant fixes throughout the day, the addiction becomes urgent, a wild animal that demands to be fed (in case you missed the symbolism of all the images of roaring lions and scratching gorillas sprinkled throughout.) \"Animals\" was filmed in Chicago, and Schiffli and cinematographer Larkin Donley, use that unmistakable urban landscape to beautiful and haunting lengths. Bobbie and Jude live everywhere and nowhere. Down in the Loop, or in Lincoln Park, in Wrigleyville and elsewhere, life is bustling and social and crowded. Bobbie and Jude walk around on the fringes of all of that, huddled in the empty spaces between the cracks. They stroll along the lakefront, stepping over sunbathers, they try to score drugs on the emptied-out outskirts of the city where the avenues are wide and deserted. Chicago seems mainly unpopulated except for the two of them, a perfect portrayal of the self-absorbed world of drugs. John Heard has a nice cameo as a security guard who befriends Bobbie in a way that actually gets through to her, his kindness coming with no strings and no judgment. The cinematography is not flashy but Donley is responsive to striking contrasts between bleak empty lots with the gleaming skyline beyond, to different moods and shapes (Jude lying long and flat in a hospital bed, with the blue flat line of Lake Michigan out the window a perfect example). It's a beautiful-looking film. Advertisement \"Animals\" is frank about Bobbie and Jude's middle-class background. During one scene, Jude lists all of his privileges, showing awareness of his fortunate status in the culture. Of course being born fortunate is not a bulwark against drug addiction, but it can provide a cushion when the bottom falls out.\u00a0Judd's teeth are rotting, Bobbie's breast hurts to the touch, Judd is constipated, but the middle-class well-fed glow of both of them still lingers, an echo of what used to be.\u00a0 There are a couple of things that make \"Animals\" effective, the main one being the performances of the two leads and the symbiotic relationship they create. Dimly, like light reaching us from a star long-dead, both actors are able to suggest that once upon a time Bobbie and Jude made a cute couple. They have been together a long time. They are not so far gone that their moral compasses are completely shattered. In one wonderful scene, the two of them, jittery from withdrawal, decide to demand money from a woman rocking a baby stroller in a park. Jude takes out his needle, saying, \"I'll tell her I have AIDS and that I'll stick her with this needle...\" Bobbie says, \"Tell her you'll stick her baby. She'll give you anything then.\" The second the words come out of her mouth, her face practically melts in the horror of what she just said. It's a gorgeous moment, beautifully conceived and beautifully played, ugly and real and terrible. Jude, ultimately, cannot go through with the scheme, informing Bobbie as he gets back in the car, \"I couldn't go through with it,\" and Bobbie says, in tears, \"I didn't want you to go through with it.\"\u00a0 Such small moments (and there are many in the film) help make what is a typical story memorable and somewhat unique. It's not a particularly interesting relationship because drug addicts tend to be boring, but it is a pleasure to watch both of these actors work.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Handmaiden", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Park Chan-Wook\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d is a love story, revenge thriller and puzzle film set in Japanese-occupied Korea in the 1930s. It is voluptuously beautiful, frankly sexual, occasionally perverse and horrifically violent. At times its very existence feels inexplicable. And yet all of its disparate pieces are assembled with such care, and the characters written and acted with such psychological acuity, that you rarely feel as if the writer-director is rubbing the audience\u2019s nose in excess of one kind or another. This is a film made by an artist at the peak of his powers: Park, a South Korean director who started out as a critic, has many great or near-great genre films, including \u201cOldboy,\u201d \u201cSympathy for Mr. Vengeance,\u201d \u201cLady Vengeance\u201d and \u201cThirst,\u201d but this one is so intricate yet light-footed that it feels like the summation of his career to date.  Advertisement It\u2019s also as inspiring an example of East-West cross-pollination as cinema has given us, on par with Akira Kurosawa\u2019s adaptations of Shakespeare, Dostoevsky and Dashiell Hammett in its ability to submerge a respected source while keeping its outlines visible. The plot faintly evokes many Gothic thrillers (chiefly \"Rebecca,\" \"Jane Eyre\" and \"Gaslight\") and quite a few examples of film noir as well; Park\u2019s source is Sarah Waters\u2019 Fingersmith, a 2002 novel set in Dickensian England that was previously made as a 2005 British miniseries. The result seems at once specifically English, specifically Korean and not of this astral plane; like Park\u2019s best work, it\u2019s an expressionistic, at times surreal movie that skates along the knife-edge of dreams. Every frame pulses with life, sometimes with blood.  The script tells of a spirited female pickpocket named Sooki, actually named Tamako ( Kim Tae-ri), who gets a job as a handmaiden at the estate of a rich old book collector (Lee Yong-nyeo), serving him and Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), the niece of his late wife; she gets pulled into a scheme by a fake count who wants to marry the niece and have her committed to an asylum so that he can claim her fortune; the book collector, the fake count\u2019s mentor, has more or less the same plan in mind. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m not that interested in money itself,\u201d says the fake count, who was raised by a Korean fisherman but claims to be Japanese and calls himself Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo). \u201cWhat I desire is\u2014how shall I put it?\u2014the manner of ordering wine without looking at the price.\u201d  The plan is fiendishly complicated, but it grows thornier still when Sooki/Tamako starts falling in love with her target. Their blossoming affair is tenderly observed\u2014a startlingly blunt sex scene is delayed until fairly deep into the film, and preceded by many scenes that pivot upon subtle glances, overheard remarks, and moments where one woman rushes to the other\u2019s defense. The fake count is handsome and can be dashing at times\u2014Ha looks so at home in a tuxedo that you could imagine him wearing it to a supermarket\u2014but he\u2019s also pig who seems to revel in his piggishness, and his intended target sees through him immediately. When he calls her \u201cmesmerizing\u201d over a tense dinner, she replies, \u201cMen use the word \u2018mesmerizing\u2019 when they wish to touch a lady\u2019s breasts.\u201d He\u2019s upfront about his utter cyncism and lack of affection for Lady Hideko, a crushed flower of a woman who was raised from girlhood as a virtual prisoner by the book collector after\u2014well, let\u2019s just call it a tragedy, because now we\u2019re at the point in this review where describing any specific moment or scene from \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d in detail would rob readers of one of the great pleasures of watching a densely plotted, elegantly executed motion picture: having no idea of what\u2019s about to happen next, yet nearly always being surprised and enthralled by both the twist itself and the film\u2019s presentation of it.  Advertisement So here we go, somewhat vaguely, into the breach: nothing is what it seems in this movie, and the things that aren\u2019t what they seem aren\u2019t quite what they don\u2019t seem to be, if that makes any sense at all (and if it doesn\u2019t right now, trust me: it will). Most of the story takes place in and around the book collector\u2019s country estate, a splendidly realized creation that\u2019s not just one of the great mansions in film history\u2014rivaled in recent movies only by the estate in another modern Gothic romance, \u201cCrimson Peak\u201d\u2014but also an organizing metaphor for the whole film. It seems to change size and shape depending on a visitor\u2019s angle of approach, and once you\u2019re inside it, the geography at first seems so clear that you could draw floor plans of its most frequently used spaces; but after a few more scenes, you realize that you only saw a small part of the house, and not only are there rooms and wings you\u2019ve never laid eyes on, there are secret doors and hidden passageways that only certain characters know about, leading to places where they can go to make love, commit sadistic acts of violence, or spy on each other. Soon enough, the movie teaches you how to watch it, and you start asking questions, like, \u201cWhat does this person truly hope to gain from sneaking here, doing this, stealing that?\u201d and \u201cAre they really spying in secret, or do the spied-upon people know somebody is watching?\" and \u201cAre the emotions being expressed by that character real, or are they faking it, or are they seeming to fake it while actually feeling those feelings?\u201d  A good many moments resonate not because of what one character is saying, but because of the looks on other characters\u2019 faces as they hear their words and either contemplate their true meaning or visualize images to accompany them. One of many show-stopping setpieces is a reading of perverse erotica from the book collector\u2019s library, accompanied by one of the weirdest sex shows in mainstream cinema, but most of the sequence\u2019s eerie power derives from observing the rapt expressions of men who\u2019ve gathered to hear explicit fiction read aloud. Nearly as powerful, though far subtler, are the cross-cut sequences that feel like self-contained short stories of their own. Dialogue or recited scraps of letters or fiction become de facto narration laid over a cascade of images, brilliantly composed for a very wide frame by Chung Chung-hoon, and backed by Cho Young-wuk\u2019s hypnotically repetitive yet rapturously melodramatic score, which rises to operatic heights when the characters are experiencing misery, ecstasy or fear. Park\u2019s sense of texture and color seems as intuitive as a painter\u2019s, but the film\u2019s narrative construction is as right-brained as Christopher Nolan at his wonkiest. \"The Handmaiden\" is neatly diced into thirds, each approximately 45 minutes long, each narrated by a different major character with parenthetical mini-narratives embedded within each, Russian nesting doll-style. As you ease into the middle third, you start to see moments and images revisited from different angles, seen or heard from fresh vantage points, or picked up slightly earlier or slightly later, altering their meaning or revealing previously withheld facts. The result is a rare film that could be equally well-represented by a billboard-sized collage of randomly chose still-frames, and a flowchart. \u201cEven listening to the same story, people imagine different things,\u201d a character warns us, so deep into the movie that the line plays not like a revelation, but a confirmation of what we we\u2019ve been feeling in our marrow.  Advertisement As you might have deduced, \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d is a story that is also about storytelling, and writing, and picture making, and the obsessive-compulsive attention to detail that links so many great artists throughout history, regardless of medium, worldview or temperament. The movie is filled with literal and figurative nods to the act of artistic creation, from the loving close-ups of the book collector\u2019s treasured volumes, the drawings and paintings made by Hideko and the fake count (he was originally hired to tutor her), and the shots of calligraphic sentences scratched onto letters and scrolls, to the way that blood spilled by lovemaking or disfigurement blooms upon mattresses and stone floors, rhyming with the lotus blossoms glimpsed in trees over the characters' heads, the eruptions of green that accompany transitions from indoors to outdoors, extreme closeups of voyeurs' eyeballs, and shots of a full moon so bright that it seems to be burning a hole through the clouds.  These touches are all striking in their own right. But they never feel ostentatiously disconnected from the story and characters. \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d is about a lot of things, among them trust and vulnerability, imprisonment and freedom, and the tension between the authentic self and the fa\u00e7ade that individuals create, and that society imposes from without. Park never loses track of these ideas or forgets about them, but they never expressed in tediously rhetorical terms\u2014always in a gliding, playful, often audaciously musical way. \"The Handmaiden\" stirs the senses by appealing to our gut feelings, our sense of morals and ethics, and our appreciation for the sight of great artists making magic as if it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Dean", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cDean\u201d is a movie that very clearly came from humane and compassionate impulses. This is particularly evident during the final third of the film, during which the principal characters reluctantly shed their defensive quirks and face up to the issues of grief and loss that have been dogging them throughout the movie.  That said, \u201cDean\u201d is also a movie with which it is easy to find fault, and if you\u2019re a particular kind of person, you\u2019ll find fault with it without even trying too hard. The movie is the directorial debut of Demetri Martin. Demetri Martin of the floppy Beatles-esque haircut (which he\u2019s still rocking at 44, an age at which those Beatles that survived to that age had rethunk their tonsorial stylings more than once) and the wry jokes and the minimalist visual-pun cartoons and the demeanor so relentlessly quiet-hipster-twee that he makes Wes Anderson look like Ozzy Osbourne. Said demeanor is on full display here, as Martin, of course, also stars in his directorial debut, which he also wrote.  Advertisement The movie opens with the writer/director/star standing at a gravesite with Kevin Kline. Kline and Martin play father and son, and the grave is that of the wife of Kline\u2019s Robert and mother of Martin\u2019s Dean. (Yes, of course Martin plays the title character.) Robert is an engineer\u2014Dean observes of him that every crisis he encounters represents a problem to be practically solved\u2014while Dean is a cartoonist who lives, you\u2019ll never guess, in Brooklyn, one of the nice leafy brownstone neighborhoods rather than the beardo-infested environs of Williamsburg or some such, so I guess that makes some kind of difference.  Father and son are handling loss in their own way. Robert wants to sell his suburban house (the \u201cflight\u201d instinct), which sets Dean right off\u2014what about his memories, his share in the house, which he seems not to have contributed to the mortgage payments on, but never mind. Dean\u2019s way of dealing had begun when his mom had gotten sick. Hoping to demonstrate that he was on a life\u2019s path that would please her, he ill-advisedly got engaged to a woman he had not been ready to commit to. Now the mother has died, the engagement is off, and Dean is acting out passive-aggressively against his ex-girlfriend, against the best friend at whose wedding he makes an ass of himself, and against his father and his house-selling scheme, which he tries to duck by flying out to Los Angeles on a faux-business trip. There he has an awful meeting with some super-miserable Internet bros (one of whom is played by Beck Bennett of \u201cSNL\u201d), and a cute meeting with Nicky, an attractive young woman he embarrasses himself in front of at one of those parties where the East Coast guy discovers that all his friends who\u2019ve moved to California have become self-absorbed monsters. I know what you\u2019re thinking: wait, isn\u2019t this \u201cGarden State\u201d with the geographics reversed? And aren\u2019t we so over the alienated-guy-meets-you-know-what-kind-of-uplifting-female-character scenario? Well, sort of, and sort of. Martin\u2019s Dean is certainly sardonic in his anti-macho way (\u201cI can\u2019t bring myself to work with people who call themselves \u2018creatives\u2019\u201d is one of the Dean apercus meant to elicit a knowing chuckle from his target demo), and his forlorn qualities are hardly unfamiliar. As for Gillian Jacobs\u2019 Nicky, her appeal does have a certain pixieish quality. There seems to be an inevitability to the Nicky/Dean pairing that\u2019s paralleled across the country in a storyline that find\u2019s Kline\u2019s dad getting intrigued by Mary Steenburgen\u2019s Carol, a real-estate agent who\u2019s helping with the under-protest-from-Dean house sale. Where the movie becomes worthwhile is at the point when the storyline puts up the speed bumps to the happy ending.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Holy Hell", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"Holy Hell,\" a documentary by Will Allen, is an account of an American religious cult as told by a filmmaker who was right in the middle of it in the 80s, and whose skills were put in service of glorifying it. Much of it consists of video footage generated by Allen when he was a member of the Buddhafield, a homegrown religion led by a man named Michel.\u00a0 Imagine you'd purchased a ticket to an evening with a filmmaker, during which he played some of the video footage he created during his time in a cult, and talked about the circumstances and about his overall experience. That's fine insofar as it goes\u2014it might even be a fun (though perhaps slightly disturbing) night out\u2014but it doesn't really add up to a compelling nonfiction feature, a format that requires some shape, a narrative spine, and a point beyond \"here is this strange thing that happened to me once.\" Advertisement Something seems off from the opening moments of the movie, which juxtapose images of Allen's stint as Buddhafield's house director with footage from his childhood as a precocious Steven Spielberg-wannabe, shooting low budget knockoffs of blockbusters like \"Jaws\" with a Super 8mm camera. (I wouldn't have minded seeing some of those films at length, honestly; they look utterly charming.) It feels a bit too much like a clip reel, advertising Allen as a filmmaker and a nice person.\u00a0 He talks about coming of age as a gay man and how his mother failed to support him, and then suddenly we skip ahead and he's in the cult. We don't get much sense of how he ended up there, exactly\u2014I mean the dramatic arc of it, the line you can trace from childhood to that moment. Nor are we given enough information and insight to understand what the cult is like on a day-to-day level\u2014what its rules and beliefs are, what the experience of life is like there. Mostly we're looking at footage of people experiencing some sort of rapture in nature. It could be an evangelical Christian group where hands are laid on the body; it could be a bunch of post-hippies tripping somewhere; it's all rather fuzzy. So is Michel, though as the story unfolds we at least get a strong feeling of of how petty, vindictive and controlling he was. (Cult leaders aren't generally known as well-adjusted people.) Throughout, there's a frustrating sense that a potentially fascinating and unsettling experience has been glossed over. At times Allen seems to be protecting himself from harsh judgment; as Michel's chief PR architect and keeper of legend, executing his requests, he is complicit in some of his former leader's worst behavior, but we don't get a clear sense of why he keep saying yes to his demands, beyond the need to kowtow the leader's charisma. In a first-person documentary where the main character is the storyteller, we really need to get a sense of how every major life choice originates in the storyteller's psychology and personal experience. We are never really privy to the depth of remorse and shame Allen surely feels at having helped burnish the image of an obviously disturbed and very destructive man. At times, the movie seems to be turning away from its subject, as you might strategically turn away from a guest at a party that you would rather not talk to. This is curious. This film's very existence amounts to an apology and an explanation, or at the very least an inquest into the self. But that should've come across much more strongly, to the point where it was hard to look at the movie because it made us feel incredulity and embarrassment at the weirdest, darkest, most inexplicable parts of our own experience.\u00a0\"Holy Hell\" should have dug a lot deeper and told its story with a lot more finesse. What happened? Maybe, after all these years, Allen was still too close to his subject? \u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Seymour: An Introduction", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The title of the new documentary directed by and featuring\r\nEthan Hawke provides a vague indication of the work\u2019s eventual assets and\r\nliabilities. On one level, the title is straightforward: the movie does\r\nintroduce viewers to Seymour Bernstein, a classical pianist in his 80s who, at\r\nthe midpoint of his life, gave up public performances and became a teacher of\r\npiano instead. Then there\u2019s the allusion to J.D. Salinger\u2019s novella, an account\r\nof the precocious genius of the Glass family, by now something of an American\r\nliterary legend. Although the evocation of Salinger and his creation evokes\r\nintriguing associations of reclusiveness and talent and all that, in the end\r\nthere\u2019s not much here to do with Salinger or his character: the title plays on\r\na coincidence, and is in a sense a bit cute and/or pretentious (my own\r\npreferred term is \u201cknow-somethingish\u201d).\u00a0 Advertisement Hawke might have more appropriately called\r\nhis short feature \u201cSeymour: An Interrogation,\u201d because while the film lays out\r\nBernstein\u2019s life story and his perceptions on art, and explores his talent,\r\nHawke makes clear from the outset that he chose Bernstein as a subject (the two\r\nmet when seated next to each other at a dinner party) in order to explore\r\nquestions hyphenate Hawke (the \u201cBoyhood\u201d and \u201cTraining Day\u201d co-star has accrued\r\nnot just several directorial credits but is a published author as well) has\r\nabout his own artistic practice. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was authentic,\u201d Hawke\r\nadmits of his own work in an early conversation with Bernstein. He apparently\r\nsees something very authentic in his subject.  In limning the world of classical music during the period in\r\nwhich Bernstein practiced, then abandoned, performance, Hawke gives viewers the\r\npicture of a very different New York City than exists today: a Manhattan, or\r\nat least a pocket of Manhattan, both aesthetically refined and at least mildly\r\naffluent. In a caf\u00e9, Bernstein reminisces with an adult former student who\r\nneglected his lessons to the extent that he became \u201cincorrigible;\u201d this\r\nwell-heeled fellow is Michael Kimmelman, now an art critic for \u201cThe New York\r\nTimes.\u201d\u00a0 Throughout the picture, Bernstein interacts with genteel folk who\r\nquietly deplore what they see as the American perception of art and\r\nart-making\u2014\u201cthey want the \u2018Flashdance\u2019 fallacy,\u201d one sighs, alluding to a\r\ntalent that flies out of a bottle like a genie with no craft or labor involved.\r\nIn between these exchanges, Bernstein works with young students, counting out\r\nmeasures, contemplating accents, working out the problem of how to get one\u2019s\r\npinkie to just this particular distant piano key in time to make the musical\r\nphrase coherent. Like Jody Lee Lipes\u2019 recent documentary \u201cBallet 422,\u201d Hawke\u2019s\r\nmovie patiently demonstrates that Art Needs Work. But it also needs philosophy,\r\nand Hawke, while never so louche as to just up and ask the reason Bernstein\r\ngave up the limelight to impart his wisdom to others instead, prods the ways\r\nBernstein\u2019s struggles to be a great performer abraded his desire to be a decent\r\nhuman being.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cJackson Pollock and\u2026Marlon Brando were all pretty notoriously\r\nhorrible people,\" Hawke suggests to\r\nBernstein at one point. \u201cThey were. And there are musicians who were monsters,\u201d\r\nBernstein responds. \u201cGlenn Gould, for example,\u201d Hawke offers. Bernstein takes\r\nthe bait, and offers up some spicy Gould dish. For Bernstein, the tragedy of\r\nGould\u2019s approach is that he\u2019s only able to hear Gould\u2019s playing: \u201cI don\u2019t hear\r\nBach,\u201d Bernstein says. Hawke lets it lay, not pursuing the question of whether\r\nthere\u2019s any value in hearing Gould qua Gould. Also curious is, given how one of\r\nthe film\u2019s threads seems to deplore the trappings of fame and acclaim him,\r\nBernstein\u2019s pleasure in having apparently played a small part in gaining a\r\nknighthood for the British pianist Clifford Curzon.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think the\r\ncontradictions implied here can\u2019t be resolved or at least fruitfully explored;\r\nit\u2019s that Hawke doesn\u2019t seem to think so. So the movie kind of flits along\u2014if\r\none wanted to be cruel one would use a word like \u201cdilettante\u201d\u2014pleasantly and\r\ninformatively enough without ever lifting off. Until the last fifteen minutes\r\nor so, in which Bernstein, having been convinced to play a semi-private recital\r\nfor Hawke\u2019s theater company, performs and discusses Schumann\u2019s \u201cFantasia.\u201d\r\nHawke, in a rather disarming display of cinematic virtuosity, cuts from\r\nBernstein playing the piece, Bernstein directly addressing the camera,\r\nBernstein directly addressing a live audience, keeping the music on a through\r\nline for the most part as Bernstein lays out its history and its significance\r\nfor both himself and music itself. A prior pronouncement by mystic Andrew\r\nHarvey, \u201cI had an experience of music creating the whole universe,\u201d suddenly\r\nseems a little less dippy. The effect of the sequence is both pedagogically\r\nrewarding and aesthetically transportive. It lifts the movie into a higher\r\nrealm.", "Critic": "Gamma"}

He seems like a nice kid, the kind stunned to\r\nbe invited to a cool party in Manhattan on an October night. When his friend, who is also his ride,\r\nbails on him, Naz \u201cborrows\u201d his father\u2019s taxi to go into the city. As he\u2019s\r\ntrying to find the party, a beautiful young woman gets into his cab. She wants\r\nto go to the beach. She's pretty enough and mysterious enough that Naz plays along. By the end of the night, he\u2019ll be arrested\r\nfor murder.  This first hour, shot by the legendary Robert Elswit (\u201cThere\r\nWill Be Blood,\u201d \u201cInherent Vice\u201d) and directed by Steven Zaillian (all but one\r\nhour were helmed by the director of \u201cSearching For Bobby Fischer,\u201d and that one\r\nwas directed by \u201cMan on Wire\u201d\u2019s James Marsh), hums like the best procedurals.\r\nModern, educated TV audiences know something is going to happen to Naz\u2014there\u2019s\r\nno show otherwise\u2014but the premiere takes its time with details that you won\u2019t\r\neven know matter until episodes later when the show is in trial. Every\r\nencounter, every decision, every moment feels both naturally captured\u2014thanks in\r\nlarge part to Ahmed\u2019s spectacularly lived-in performance, which only gets better in subsequent episodes\u2014and also part of a\r\ncomplex piece of art. In that sense, \u201cThe Night Of\u201d reminds one of Lumet\u2019s '70s and \u201880s\r\nfilms in that character is never lost in the \u201cbigger picture\u201d of mystery or\r\ncommentary. Lumet had an incredible ability to tell NY stories that were both sprawling and intimate. \"The Night Of\" shares that duality. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the arguable protagonist of the\r\npiece, attorney John Stone (John Turturro) has echoes of Paul Newman\u2019s Frank Galvin from \u201cThe Verdict.\u201d He carries around business cards with his smiling face\r\nand just happens on Naz in the precinct holding cell on the fateful night in question. Does he see innocence\r\nin Naz\u2019s eyes? Or does he just see opportunity? Exactly what each of the key characters in \u201cThe Night Of\u201d are getting out of the situation, especially major\r\nplayers like Detective Box (the great Bill Camp) and a young attorney named Chandra\r\n(Amara Karan), becomes essential to the way it unfolds. And when Naz gets to\r\nRikers, where young men are held until trial and either hardened further or\r\npossibly even killed, he meets a career criminal (the mesmerizing Michael K. Williams) who\r\nsees him as an opportunity. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d exemplifies the ripple effect of not just crime but the mechanics of a\r\ncriminal investigation, from the men whose path crosses with Naz\u2019s at Rikers to\r\nhis family (including the great Asghar Farhadi regular Peyman Maadi as Naz\u2019s father),\r\nunable to cover his defense.  Advertisement On top of all these great ensemble performances and\r\nmemorable characters, there\u2019s a riveting procedural element to \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d\r\nespecially in the early episodes, in which Zaillian and Price display an\r\nobvious fascination and respect for relatively unwanted jobs being done\u2014from the\r\ngraveyard shift at the police station to the morgue attendants and so on. It\u2019s\r\nthe kind of show where you distinctly hear the squeak of a dry erase marker as it writes \u201cHomicide\u201d\r\non the white board. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d doesn\u2019t cut corners, giving Price fans the\r\ndetails they expect but that we rarely see in episodic television. And yet the\r\nbalance between detail and character is never thrown off. In one sense, it\u2019s a\r\nprocedural with a protagonist uninterested in procedure or facts (Stone makes\r\nclear that he doesn\u2019t care if Naz did it or not\u2014actual guilt or innocence is\r\nonly one issue in the criminal justice system). It unfolds confidently as a\r\ngreat crime novel AND as a character study of two men who would never meet if not for a murder, likely because of Price\u2019s ability\r\nwith the detailed mechanics of the crime novel mixed with Zaillian\u2019s very human touch with actors. Let\u2019s hope\r\nthey work together again soon. (Note: They only made seven of eight episodes available for press so if it all goes off the rails in the final\r\nhour, remember the star rating is based on what I\u2019ve seen. I have faith, though.)", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Dark Places", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Gillian Flynn\u2019s script for\r\nDavid Fincher\u2019s incredible adaptation of \u201cGone Girl\u201d was a master class in\r\ngenre, taking an admittedly ridiculous, twisting and turning narrative and making its plot holes forgivable\r\nthrough sheer force of entertainment value. It makes sense that another of\r\nFlynn\u2019s novels, the sinister \u201cDark Places,\u201d would get the cinematic treatment\r\nas well, although this failed exercise could be used comparatively with \u201cGone\r\nGirl\u201d as a What Not to Do cinematic lesson. Whereas Fincher and Flynn brought\r\nstyle and flair to the saga of Amazing Amy, writer/director Gilles\r\nPaquet-Brenner presents a drab, dull, uninspired affair, enlivened only\r\nslightly by the talented cast assembled. Failing to find a visual language\r\nfor the piece that reaches beyond a Lifetime TV Movie and adapting the material\r\nin such a way that makes her protagonist largely inactive in her own story,\r\nPaquet-Brenner only makes the already-underrated \u201cGone Girl\u201d look even more\r\naccomplished. Advertisement When she was only seven, Libby Day (Sterling Jerins)\r\nsuffered the unimaginable. Her entire family was murdered in a shotgun rampage\r\nlike something out of \u201cIn Cold Blood.\u201d In fact, the murders earned that kind of\r\ninternational attention, especially after Libby\u2019s brother Ben (Tye Sheridan)\r\nwas arrested and sentenced for them. Accused of dabbling in Satanism,\r\nBen was convicted on little evidence, and true crime nuts have been convinced\r\nfor years that there was more to the Day murders. Of course, there was, because,\r\nwell, there\u2019s no movie otherwise. Bitter and hardened by life, grown Libby (Charlize Theron)\r\nhasn\u2019t been in touch with her incarcerated brother (played by Corey Stoll older)\r\nsince the crimes. That\u2019s when she\u2019s contacted by Lyle Wirth (Nicholas Hoult), a\r\nmember of a true crime club that collects items and information from bloodbaths\r\naround the country. He convinces the broke Libby to tell her story to the club,\r\nand she needs the cash enough to do so. Of course, Lyle has ulterior motives,\r\nconvinced that Ben is innocent, and he eventually talks Libby into digging\r\ndeeper into what really happened that night.  Both narratives\u2014the current-day investigation and the days\r\nleading up to the murder years earlier\u2014are intercut in this murky, unrefined\r\nscreenplay that piles up narrative and twists without ever considering the\r\npiece\u2019s deadly lack of characters. Theron does her brooding best to make Libby\r\nthree-dimensional, but, and this could be partly the fault of the source\r\nmaterial, she is almost always merely a listener to someone presenting more\r\ndetails about her past or entirely absent in the extensive flashbacks. Consequently,\r\n\u201cDark Places\u201d is a film without a protagonist, akin to watching recreated footage\r\non \u201cDateline NBC,\u201d as each flashback or revelatory conversation fills in a few more\r\ndetails of the overheated story without giving us a reason to care about it in the\r\nfirst place. Poor Theron wanders through a narrative designed around reveals; so she\u2019s either remembering things she couldn\u2019t have possibly\r\nknown about or hearing about things she should have figured out a long time ago.\r\nAs he often has lately, Corey Stoll actually makes out the best in a few\r\ncrucial scenes as the older Ben, and Hoult certainly isn\u2019t bad even if his\r\ncharacter, like so many of them, feels like a plot device.  Advertisement All of this leads to a distinct lack of urgency in \u201cDark\r\nPlaces,\u201d which makes the dour, depressing subject matter that much harder to\r\nenjoy. It's a checklist of awful things that can happen to a Middle American family. The Day matriarch (Christina Hendricks) is afraid of losing the farm,\r\ntheir dad (a suspect in the murders) is missing, Satanism threatens to entice\r\nyoung Ben, the kid is accused of child abuse, drugs, teenage pregnancy\u2014the whole\r\nthing verges on poverty porn given the lack of genre escapism provided. We\r\nneeded a reason to wallow in the dark places of Libby Day\u2019s horrible life to\r\nmake the cinematic journey worthwhile. No one involved in the production of \u201cDark\r\nPlaces\u201d ever asked a crucial question: Why should we care?", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "U Want Me 2 Kill Him?", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Sixteen-year-old Mark (Jamie Blackley) sits in a cold interrogation room in the opening scenes of \"U Want Me 2 Kill Him?\" and is asked why he stabbed John in the alley. Mark answers, \"For the greater good.\" Based on a true story, which dominated British tabloids in 2003, resulting in a groundbreaking legal case (and inspiring an opera), \"U Want Me 2 Kill Him?\" takes us through how Mark arrived at that particular creepy answer. The facts of the case almost beggar belief, and were told, in full, in a 2005 Vanity Fair article by Judy Bachrach. The film assumes we do not know the story. Director Andrew Douglas, who helmed the \"Amityville Horror\" remake in 2005, and screenwriter Mike Walden, have chosen to structure the film like a typical thriller police procedural, with a jumbled chronology and a third-act reveal when the truth comes out. It's effective, in its way, and the acting is excellent, across the board. But \"U Want Me 2 Kill Him\" side-steps the real fascination with the story, its real guts, which is: Why?  Advertisement Criminal duos are endlessly interesting due to the psychological questions they bring up: Would either of the individuals have acted alone? Would Macbeth have done what he did if he hadn't had his wife whispering in his ear to \"man up\"? Would Leopold and Loeb have ever committed that crime by themselves? What is in the alchemy of the respective pairings that created this murderous third? Cinema loves its deadly duos, from \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" to \"Heavenly Creatures,\" to \"Gun Crazy,\" to \"Don't Deliver Us From Evil\", the list goes on forever. The pairing in \"U Want Me 2 Kill Him?\" is different in many important ways, mainly because Mark is unaware that he is being played. He was a dupe, a fool of a much more cunning individual. What happened to Mark that made him open to the whispered sinister suggestion, what was in him (or not in him) that made him blindly accept everything at face value?  Mark lives with his parents in Manchester. He goes to school, he's popular, and he has big vague dreams of doing something that nobody has done before (\"like create the Internet.\") His parents are nicely drawn individuals, the father who lifts weights and tells his son to be \"his own Master\", while the mother compulsively buys lottery tickets every week. Meanwhile, Mark has a whole world they do not know about. Every night he sexy-chats online with a girl he has never met, a pretty blonde named Rachel (Jaime Winstone). Not only is Rachel great at dirty talk, she is also (and this seems to be the most attractive part to Mark) a damsel in distress. She is afraid of her violent boyfriend Kevin (Mingus Johnston). She has secrets. She also happens to have a little brother who goes to school with Mark, a geeky weird kid named John (Toby Regbo). John gets bullied. Rachel pleads with Mark to look out for him.  Mark and John, somewhat improbably, become friends, after Mark beats up some of the bullies. The two hang out, John opens up to Mark about all of his problems, how worried he is about his sister Rachel, how much he hates how he is treated at school. Through John, Mark learns more about his mysterious night-time Internet friend, Rachel. Her boyfriend is in the witness protection program, she has cut ties with the family, everyone is afraid she is in danger. Ominously, Rachel stops contacting Mark. When Mark confronts John about this, John tearfully tells him that Rachel is dead, probably murdered by Kevin.  Advertisement Mark is devastated. He starts lifting weights. He fools around with his dad's gleaming sword, slicing through the air in his living room, lost in a fantasy of revenge. Things take a turn into the definitely bizarre when an MI5 agent contacts Mark, via IM, and warns him off Kevin, saying that MI5 is tracking Kevin for their own byzantine conspiracy-theory reasons having to do with counter-terrorism. Mark never once questions the credibility of those he encounters online, and never once asks why on earth an MI5 agent would not only reach out to him personally, but enlist his help in another one of their operations. Mark's credulity is certainly believable, and one can sense that this is a boy who doesn't know what he wants to do in life, his grades are not all that good, and he wants to make a big impression on people. He's a perfect \"mark\", in other words.  The puzzle-piece timeline, starting with the crime and the ensuing investigation (led by a police inspector, played by \"Downton Abbey\"'s Joanne Froggatt) mixed with flashbacks to how it all began, works, but the real horror, of why this might have happened, is ultimately lost in the cliched genre-trappings of the story's structure. Instead what we are given is a cautionary tale about being wary of the folks you meet on the Internet, which has been done before and done better. The reason this story ignited debates that persist to this day is the \"why\" of it. How was Mark so manipulated?  Douglas has used an almost entirely blue palate, drenching the film (too much at times) in cold paranoia and isolation. There are some great visuals, John and Mark approaching Kevin's towering tenement building, dwarfed by its sheer stone walls, or the two boys strolling on a rock jetty by the seaside, almost entirely surrounded by water. Mark looks out at the boats in the sea, and they seem misty and glamorous and far far away. These are tantalizing glimpses, hinting at the deeper psychological abysses at play here, but they are left unexplored.  By holding back on the big \"reveal\", by prioritizing the desire to \"sting\" the audience at the end, \"U Want Me 2 Kill Him\" stays frustratingly on the surface.

{"Title": "Tomb Raider", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Based on the 2013 video game, and featuring Alicia Vikander as\u00a0the latest incarnation of a character who's been around for 22 years, \"Tomb Raider\" surprisingly\u00a0plays like a throwback to the classic late-'80s/early '90s\u00a0era of action filmmaking, represented by the likes of \"Cliffhanger,\" \"The Last of the Mohicans,\"\u00a0the first couple of Indiana Jones films, and Jackie Chan's \"Armour of God\" series. From the animated prologue, wherein the title character's archeologist father, Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), tells of an ancient, cursed tomb supposedly containing the all-powerful, weaponizable\u00a0remains of the Japanese shaman queen Himiko, through its gracefully executed series of chases and emotional moments, to its finale set on a Pacific island riddled with booby-trapped ruins, \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0is much better and more original\u00a0than anyone could have expected.\u00a0 Advertisement Although it borrows\u00a0from the game (and, partially, its sequel) for structure and most of its key\u00a0action sequences, \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0never feels like a pointless companion piece to a work that was created for a different medium. I've never played the game this film is adapting, but I\u00a0had a great time watching the movie it inspired, thanks mainly to the\u00a0direction; the stunt choreography, which leans on real performers and props whenever it makes sense to; the emphasis on problem-solving one's way out of tight situations; and most of all,\u00a0the actors, who flesh out archetypal\u00a0characters who might have seemed cliched or merely flat on the page, and make them as real as they can, considering what sort of movie they're in.\u00a0 First among equals is Alicia Vikander with her faintly regal bearing. She's correctly cast as a woman\u00a0who's literally to-the-manor-born, but the\u00a0humility and sense of fair play that she exudes\u00a0makes you like rather than resent the character.\u00a0More importantly, though, she's an action hero par excellence.\u00a0Carved like a wood sculpture, and seemingly bereft of body fat, Vikander hurls\u00a0herself into the film's action sequences. She makes you feel the physicality of this intensely visceral\u00a0performance, letting\u00a0out a high-pitched grunt of rage or pain when Lara crashes into a wall or\u00a0gets slammed on the ground by a brawny\u00a0foe, and letting sparks of fury flash in her eyes as Lara delivers a coup-de-grace. The movie has given a lot of thought to the question of\u00a0how a small woman could successfully fight opponents who are a lot\u00a0bigger and stronger than she is. The answers are relentless\u00a0speed, the strategic use of full body weight, and dirty fighting.\u00a0This is not to say that \"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0is \"realistic\" in any sense, because no video game movie is\u2014at one point, Lara powers through after\u00a0a puncture wound that would put a 250-pound Green\u00a0Beret out of commission\u2014but that the filmmakers and Vikander are doing everything they can to sell the physical and emotional reality from moment to moment. Advertisement To that end, \"Tomb Raider\" is more emotionally demonstrative than films in this vein tend to be. As written by\u00a0Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons, there's\u00a0a strong element of domestic\u00a0melodrama at the heart of the tale: Lara's father went missing and is presumed dead. The movie gradually\u00a0fills out the\u00a0details of their relationship, balancing Lara's admiration, even worship, of her father\u00a0against the deep pain\u00a0caused by his frequent absences and ultimate disappearance. This is the story of a daughter learning from, surpassing, and ultimately forgiving\u00a0her dad\u2014a journey that hits fresher beats than you tend to get in genre films starring male heroes\u00a0whose fathers died, vanished, or disappointed them (although the third Indiana Jones movie deals in these themes, too).\u00a0 Paternal abandonment and its aftermath are at the heart of every character's story here.\u00a0Lu Ren (Daniel Wu), the alcoholic sea captain who ferries Lara to the island that contains Himiko's tomb, is dealing with his own daddy issues:\u00a0his same-named father once ran the boat, and ultimately vanished, too, which might account for why their relationship feels more brother-sister than romantic (they obviously\u00a0respect each other, but there's no sexual chemistry because the movie isn't interested in finding any). The bad guy, archaeologist turned corporate mercenary\u00a0Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins), is himself an absentee husband and father.\u00a0He's\u00a0spent seven years trying to locate Himiko's tomb at the behest of the mysterious Trinity organization, and feels great resentment toward the unseen master who's keeping him on the island\u00a0until he can complete\u00a0the job.\u00a0 Lara is an emotional person who has empathy for others and feels things deeply. I liked how you could hear the catch in her voice or see tears almost well up in her eyes as she deals with moments that cause her distress, because these details\u00a0affirm the validity of such a response, and confirm\u00a0that the movie isn't going to just graft a bunch of standard-issue, strong-silent tough guy cliches onto a female lead\u00a0and call it a day. There's more sensitivity and intelligence on display here\u00a0than there needed to be,\u00a0and while \"Tomb Raider\" doesn't go as far in this direction\u00a0as I\u00a0would've liked, the unmistakable effort means a lot. \u00a0Particularly striking is the moment after Lara kills someone for the first time: she sits next to the corpse for a long moment, looking psychically disturbed as well as physically exhausted. The act of\u00a0killing is presented in such a cavalier manner in so many action and adventure\u00a0films that it\u2019s a bit shocking to see it treated as if it means something. Advertisement In the end, though, this is a movie about a woman running, running, running, running, and then maybe\u00a0pausing just long enough to kill a man with a bow and arrow, defeat him in hand-to-hand combat, or solve a tumbler-styled puzzle that will open the stone door of a temple containing ancient treasures.\u00a0\"Tomb Raider\"\u00a0treats Vikander as a moving piece of sculpture, admiring her not in a sexually objectifying way,\u00a0but as one might an athlete.\u00a0When filming her in action, director Roar Uthaug (\"The Wave\")\u00a0often adopts the perspective of an especially kinetic videogame, shooting Vikander from a low angle as she races toward the camera, or from an elevated perspective looking at the back of her head and her shoulders, the better to appreciate Lara as she cuts a path through her world.\u00a0 There are at least five action sequences in this movie that rank with the best I've seen recently. The first is a\u00a0\"fox hunt\" on bicycles\u00a0through the streets of London which sees\u00a0Lara, who works as a\u00a0bike messenger before embracing her destiny as heir to her dad's legacy, leading a pack of her colleagues on a\u00a0chase through winding streets packed with cars and trucks. Another finds Lara diving off a cliff into a raging river; she catches herself before going over a waterfall by clinging to a rusted-out,\u00a0World War II-era bomber that's teetering\u00a0on its edge, then gradually moves over and through the rotting husk of the\u00a0plane, trying to get to the riverbank before the whole thing falls apart. (A great Indiana Jones-style moment: as she hears the buckling groan and sees the plane falling to pieces, she mutters, \"Really?\")\u00a0 There are frustrations here and there, mainly having to do with the plotting and some of the\u00a0supporting characters, who are lively and memorable but often lack one or two scenes that would've made them seem as mythically vivid as the material demands. (Vogel's misery is fascinating at first, but ultimately becomes tedious, and I\u00a0didn't like the way the film sidelined Ren during the final act.) Still, this is a beautifully crafted and unpretentious piece of action cinema, with a number of sequences that are as gorgeous as they are thrilling, and\u00a0a female hero who's as elegant\u00a0as she is deadly:\u00a0an ass-kicking Audrey Hepburn.

{"Title": "Tangerine", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Tangerine\" is a comedy about a transgender prostitute looking for her pimp's girlfriend\r\n on Christmas Eve, shot with an iPhone camera. That description sounds like it could have been written as part of a parody of a film festival schedule. But the movie is the real deal. As written \r\nby Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch and directed by Baker, it's assured and immensely likable, and truly \r\nindependent in story and style. The heroine is Sin-Dee \r\nRella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez), who gets out of jail after six weeks and \r\nlearns from her best friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) that the pimp she's \r\nin love with cheated on her while she was away\u2014and with a cisgender \r\nfemale, of all things. This betrayal is established in the opening scene\r\n of \"Tangerine,\" a conversation near the front window of a coffee shop. \r\nThe scene lasts several minutes and is carried entirely by the \r\nperformers' energy and humor, and by Baker and Radium Cheng's innovative photography. The movie was shot with an Anamorphic widescreen attachment, and the colors are \r\nsuper-saturated to the point where Sin-Dee and Alexandra might as well \r\nbe characters in a Technicolor musical. The result is at once edgy and glossy, adjectives you don't normally see paired. Sin-Dee withdraws \r\ninto sullen rage and stalks through the neighborhood. She spends the first \r\nhalf of the movie looking for the girlfriend, Dinah (Mickey O'Hagan), \r\nwhose blond whiteness and God-given ladyparts amount to a double insult.\r\n During the second half, she's looking for her pimp, Chester (James \r\nRansome, aka Ziggy on HBO's \"The Wire\"). Woe betide the bastard: Sin-Dee\r\n has fire in her eyes. Advertisement Sin-Dee's odyssey through Hollywood \r\nprovides the film's main action, but there are a couple of parallel \r\nstories. One involves Alexandra's attempts to get everyone to come see \r\nher perform that night at a local nightclub; she hands out postcards \r\nwhen she's not chasing after her friend and inquiring about the targets \r\nof Sin-Dee's wrath. The second strand belongs to an Armenian cabdriver \r\nnamed Razmik (Karren Karagulian) who is married and has a child but \r\nfrequents transgender prostitutes on the side. His tastes are quite \r\nspecific, and he won't settle. In one of the movie's most revealing \r\nscenes (in every sense), Razmik picks up a prostitute that he assumes is his\r\n type only to discover that she has a vagina, and angrily demands that \r\nshe get out of his cab immediately.  This scene could stand for \r\n\"Tangerine\" itself. It creates its own world, one with different \r\ndefinitions of \"normal\" or \"acceptable\" than Hollywood or even \r\nmainstream indie cinema usually offers, and the film is most thrilling for that \r\nreason. The originality extends to the setting and how it's presented. Long sections of \"Tangerine\" consist of shots of people walking and walking and walking and walking to get anywhere in Los Angeles, sometimes after having waited on a bus that seemed as though it would never arrive, or taking a cab because they were too old or too drunk to drive their own vehicle, or because they don't have a vehicle, or can't have one. You almost never see a Los Angeles movie about people who don't own cars. This is a minor point in the movie's greater scheme, but it seems like one key to appreciating the movie's specialness.\u00a0  None of this should imply that the film is a flawless masterpiece. Like the \r\nrecent American indies \"Gabriel\" and \"Runoff,\" both of which I liked \r\nquite a bit, \"Tangerine\" has a brief running time but still feels padded\r\n in places. Some of the dialogue sounds too improvised (even if it was \r\nscripted). The ending seems to be aiming for a spectacular, screwball \r\nmeltdown, but it nearly implodes the movie, because it goes and on and on, and the various \r\nstorytelling threads that converge there haven't been properly guided \r\ntoward their supposedly inevitable collision. It often plays like an attempt to force coherence on an\r\n otherwise endearingly loose movie.  Advertisement And certain aspects of the story \r\nare\u2014as Internet thinkpieces are found of saying\u2014problematic, particularly the violence that Sin-Dee inflicts on Dinah, grabbing and dragging and lifting and even slapping her repeatedly, over the course of several scenes. \"Tangerine\" treats this action as outrageously funny; it seems to expect us to write it off as, \"Well, this is just what would happen in that world,\" a valid enough observation, but one that only takes us so far. True, the violence is balanced by subsequent scenes of Sin-Dee and Dinah and eventually Alexandra reaching a kind of understanding, and even displaying tenderness toward each other. But the later scenes don't cancel out the sour taste left by the earlier ones. This is a case where the problem isn't what's being shown, but the film's evident attitude toward what it's showing us, at the moment that it's showing it. That we rarely see transgender characters in movies who aren't prostitutes is an entirely separate issue that I'm sure will be discussed in months to come\u2014but here, too, we have to keep such misgivings in context: American films rarely show us worlds like these, and when they do, the films don't tend to get much attention.  If it were possible to time-warp \"Tangerine\" back a few decades, it could be part of that wave of indies that redefined American cinema \r\nin the eighties and nineties, with features like \"Go Fish,\" \"The Living \r\nEnd,\" \"Clerks,\"\u00a0 \"The Brother from Another Planet\" and \"She's Gotta Have It\"\u2014 works that, acting- and storytelling-wise, were rough around the \r\nedges, but compensated by depicting worlds rarely seen onscreen, with warmth and confidence. \"Tangerine\" has that kind of vitality. It turns murals and signage, palm trees and Spanish tiled strip-mall roofs into \"production value,\" and has the guts to let key scenes play out as silent montages scored to dreamy synthesized music cues, like something out a Michael Mann film. Sin-Dee and Alexandra and Dinah and Chester and Razmik are great characters, played by actors with tremendous energy. They seem to have existed before the opening credits rolled. After the closing credits have faded you'll think about them, and wonder how they're doing.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "London Town", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "For as many valid and well-reasoned arguments exist about how nostalgia is a spiritually and culturally ossifying force, human beings and the culture industry that pursues them can\u2019t seem to help the practice. Of all the bands that emerged during the U.K.\u2019s punk rock years, The Clash was perhaps the most explicitly anti-nostalgia; the entire point of the songs was a here-and-now anger. This extended from the no-Elvis-no-Beatles-no-Stones new rule of its single \u201c1977\u201d to the 1981 simulated emergency broadcast of \u201cThis Is Radio Clash.\u201d By pointing this out I don\u2019t mean to suggest that The Clash\u2019s music has no validity when heard in 2016. But it signifies very differently. Advertisement In any event, the particularity of what the band did in the late 1970s makes the nostalgic spectacle of \u201cLondon Town\u201d kind of curious. The movie, directed by Derrick Borte from a script by Matt Brown (adapting a prior project written by Sonya Gildea and Kirsten Sheridan, and no, these kinds of pass-the-conceptual-football writing credits never really bode well, do they) gets the music pretty well, even as it fudges some release dates. But the movie\u2019s impersonal, conventional telling of a reasonably standard male coming-of-age story almost tends to make the punk milieu it depicts beside the point.  As the movie opens, Shay (Daniel Huttlestone), a fellow in his early teens who wears flared pants that are at least four years behind the times even by 1977 standards, feels oppressed in his just-outside-of-London home, living with single dad Nick (Dougray Scott) and a little sister. He gets a letter and a cassette tape from his mum, who\u2019s apparently swinging in London, punk style. A few tentative forays to the big city find Shay romancing a sassy punkette named Vivian (Nell Williams), finding that his mum\u2019s communal lifestyle is somewhat more rough and ready than is appropriate for a 15-year-old, and being counseled by Joe Strummer himself, a fellow who seems to turn up in the most unlikely places. For instance, as a fare in Shay\u2019s father\u2019s cab, which Shay is driving, in drag.  It\u2019s a long story, tied up with his dad\u2019s hospitalization after an accident and the subsequent economic doom it portends. While trying to stave off disaster, Shay also experiences the exhilaration of being young and idealistic and in love and actually attending Clash rehearsals. In the hands of more distinctive filmmakers this might come off, but the approach here is indie-slick and impersonal. Which, among other things, underscores just what a boring readymade character young Shay is. When he discovers that Vivian\u2019s home environment is quite a bit posher than she\u2019s let on, he responds with a hissy fit of ugly sexism that you just know is going to be forgiven by both Vivian and the film before the final credits. This might be realistic, but it\u2019s also boring and stale. The portrayal of Strummer by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (who has a history of portraying rockers simultaneously iconic and iconoclastic; see \u201cVelvet Goldmine\u201d) is, I suppose, an interesting rethink of Strummer\u2019s micromanaged guttersnipe charisma. But it\u2019s one that would have been more interesting in a better film. Advertisement As it happens, in 1980 Jack Hazan and David Mingay directed a picture called \u201cRude Boy,\u201d about a genuinely lumpen young man who hangs out around The Clash long enough to become a roadie for the band. It\u2019s not a good film per se but it\u2019s authentically grungy and purposefully uningratiating, and the band members, playing themselves, have the honesty to depict themselves as not-entirely-nice guys throughout. Not louts, but working performers who can\u2019t be around to hold anyone else\u2019s hand, to say the least. It might make an instructive double feature with this film, which is a confection by comparison.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Where everything is bad, it must be good to know the worst.\" The British philosopher F.H. Bradley wrote that, and while he was surely not referring to the relative glut of bad movies that American distributor dump into theaters during the six-to-eight week winter/awards season lull at the beginning of each year, such is the state of things that while it may indeed be good to know the worst, it's kind of difficult to tell. There's also a kind of inverse correlative possible: with so much bad, how can you tell what's good?  Advertisement On the face of things, a studio reboot of the late writer Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character, a sort of American James Bond for the neocon/family values set, seems like an opportunistic and banal idea. And for the first minutes of \"Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit,\" which rewrites the Ryan origin story by placing the young character in the London School of Economics for the terror attack of 9/11, opportunism and banality go hand in hand with nary a care in the world, it seems. Things get less blithe, and a little shaky, when appealing, square-jawed, eagle-eyed Chris Pine's undercover C.I.A. fiscal analyst Ryan is pairing off romantically with what seems to be a severely miscast Keira Knightley, who, try as she might, doesn't quite make it as a wholesome, uncomplicated young American woman of substantial backbone. So my question during the initial part of the movie was, \"Just how bad will this be?\"  But then something interesting (and pretty rare) happens: the movie finds its feet, and unrolls as a pretty suspenseful, largely engaging, and hardly ever too-over-the-top spy thriller. Once Ryan finds himself in Moscow, investigating what looks to him like a conspiracy to sink the U.S. dollar (you can tell this movie is a fantasy because as the plot proper unfolds one character refers to our native currency's \"strong performance\"), the ex-Marine finds himself back in action, and a fight scene that quotes purposefully from both \"From Russia With Love\" and \"Torn Curtain\" gets the adrenaline up. The presence of Russian villains suggests a certain Cold War nostalgia, at least as far as plot-point potential is concerned, on the part of screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp. On the other hand, maybe they're just spy movie classicists.\u00a0In any event, director Kenneth Branagh casts himself as one of them, and boy does he have a devil of a time playing chilly, drug-addicted psychopath financier Viktor Cherevin. (Mikhail Baryshnikov also seems to enjoy his role as an old-school Kremlin cardinal.) Also adding a good deal of juice is a straight-backed, just-offhand enough Kevin Costner as Ryan's spymaster. After Knightley's curious Cathy follows Ryan to Moscow and obliges him to blow his cover (I assume you're all familiar with the covert-C.I.A.-agent-drill in Popular Cinema by now), it's all in for a quasi-\"Mission Impossible\" style breach of Cherevin's corporation (whose logo bears a striking resemblance to that of Enron, oddly enough), to stop not just a fiscal disaster but a new terrorist attack on American soil. Yes, the movie does pack in a lot of plot, and as you may have inferred, much of said plot is pretty derivative (the talk early on of a controversial oil pipeline will ring \"The World Is Not Enough\" bells for spy movie mavens). Derivative doesn't mean dumb, though (okay, it doesn't mean \"too dumb\"), and what the movie lacks in originality the cast and the director make up for in sheer let-us-entertain-you enthusiasm. Knightley eventually finds her footing\u2014largely when she's left alone with Branagh, and their respective characters can cagily chat about Lermontov, as British thespians so often do among themselves. And while the movie does eventually trot out the too-common commonplaces of the damsel in distress and the ticking time bomb for the climax and grand finale, it plays those tropes with what passes for discretion in contemporary action movies. In short, a spy movie that will satisfy if you happen to be in the mood for one. Which in January constitutes something of a minor miracle.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Pacific Rim Uprising", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "I'm writing this review in a hurry because every hour I wait makes it harder to remember \"Pacific Rim Uprising.\"\u00a0 On a craft level, this sequel to Guillermo del Toro's monsters-versus-biomechanical warriors saga \"Pacific Rim\" isn't terrible. At the very least, it doesn't stint on images of huge things crashing into other huge things, as well as collateral damage in the form of cratering streets, collapsing buildings, and panicked civilians (who are shown racing away from the mayhem but rarely being hurt or killed). Set ten years later, the movie showcases giant gundam, or j\u00e4gers, fighting a new kind of kaiju (I won't go into details because it would spoil one of the film's only surprises) and, for variety, j\u00e4gers battling other j\u00e4gers. Younger kids might like it, and it's probably a safer bet for that age group than the \"Transformers\" films, which are strangely filled with racist and sexist images as well as a needlessly sleazy undertone. Advertisement And the cast is filled with actors doing everything they can to make their characters as memorable as possible even when the script (credited to four people) isn't lending them the support they deserve. John Boyega, in particular, saves long stretches of the movie just by being his appealing self. Ever since \"The Force Awakens,\" he's been honing a screen persona that owes a lot to the late James Garner\u2014a funny, cynical survivor who makes a point of avoiding unnecessary fights and keeping one eye on the exit at all times, but who also has a buried streak of righteous honor that surfaces during dire moments. He's operating in that mode here, playing Jake Pentecost, the pilot-turned-scrapper son of the original film's inspirational warrior-guru Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). But there are two major problems, and the movie never manages to overcome either of them.  One is that the whole sequel storyline feels like a sad afterthought to the original, which saw various two-person crews of misfit eccentrics overcoming their animosities and neuroses to become one mind, operate their machines, and bash, smash and burn giant beasts who'd slipped through a dimensional portal at the bottom of the sea. To its credit, this sequel from director Steven S. DeKnight (TV's \"Spartacus\") doesn't just decide, \"Well, the portal that we thought we'd closed is open again, and there are more monsters, so everybody saddle up,\" because that would've been as lame as the plot of the\u00a0 \"Independence Day\" sequel. But what the movie does come up with has been built out in a halfhearted, clumsy manner that underlines the cynical nature of the exercise: a plot involving the rush to deploy j\u00e4ger drones overseen by the shadowy Shao Corporation, which has been getting a little too close to the kaiju brains that its top secret research depends on.  There are supporting turns by returning characters, including Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), the \"Pacific Rim\" pilot who subsequently became an important world leader, and oddball scientists Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) and Dr. Newt Geiszler (Charlie Day). The latter moves to the center of the story thanks to his kaiju mind-meld in the first film. Now he's the co-chief of the Shao Corporation's drone development program alongside Liwen Shao (Jing Tian of \"Kong: Skull Island\" and \"The Great Wall\"). While Day doesn't have the gravitas for what he's been asked to do here, his oddball intensity is a welcome contrast with the earnestness displayed elsewhere (Scott Eastwood's snarling pilot Nate Lambert being an especially one-note example). An orphaned  street urchin turned juvenile pilot named Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny) is also regrettably indistinct\u2014essentially a retread of Mako Mori with a few years knocked off her age, ready-made for big brother-little sister or surrogate father-daughter bonding.  It's not the actress' fault that the movie mistakes gritted teeth and cartoon spunk for a personality. Advertisement Which brings us to the second problem: no Del Toro. Even at their liveliest, these performers can only do so much without the originator at the helm. The project lacks the purplish intensity and explosions of juvenile poetry that made the original \"Pacific Rim\" so distinctive, whether you loved or hated it. I loved it. In fact, I like to tell people it's the \"Citizen Kane\" of movies where robots smash dinosaurs in the face with boats. That film's feverish commitment to every detail of the universe it created was admirable. From the names and powers it bestowed on its machines and creatures to the thought it put into what urban life and popular culture would look like in a world besieged by kaiju attacks, there was no doubt that it meant something to the people who made it. It was the work of true believers with childlike enthusiasm for the absurd. Del Toro even believed in the themes of personal redemption and collective effort that were baked into the details of the j\u00e4ger's mechanics.  He got high on his own supply, and not only was that forgivable, it was exactly what a filmmaker was supposed to do in that kind of circumstance. Here, with a few brief exceptions, it feels as if the studio and the filmmakers just held onto a lot of the CGI programs they'd used to create the effects in the original film and decided to give them one more lap around the track for box office's sake, while making a point of pandering to the Chinese market that made the original film an international success after it did disappointing business elsewhere. (There's nothing wrong with that last part, of course\u2014I only mention it because, once you've seen the movie, it seems like a far better explanation for why \"Uprising\" exists than anything supplied by the script.) The fate of the world has rarely been decided in as rote a manner as it is here, although I'll confess that the final act\u2014a battle climaxing on the crest of Mt. Fuji, site of many a showdown in a golden era Japanese monster flick\u2014has a flair for melodrama and grandiose imagery that the rest of the project sorely lacks.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Mummy", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "By now you\u2019ve probably read a number of scathing reviews of \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d Universal\u2019s inaugural entry in a possibly grievously ill-advised \u201cDark Universe\u201d franchise, wherein the legendary studio intends to reboot its most Famous Monsters of Filmland. Perhaps I\u2019m becoming jaded in my old age, but I was more amused than appalled.  Don\u2019t get me wrong. \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d directed (if that\u2019s what you want to call it; I honestly think the better term here is \u201costensibly overseen on behalf of the studio executives\u201d) by Alex Kurtzman from a script by David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie, and Dylan Kussman, has plenty to get irritated about. I got sand in my synapses during an early scene in which Tom Cruise, as a looter named Nick Morton (oh, \u201cMort,\u201d I get it now), and his sidekick, played by Jake Johnson, casually slaughter a bunch of \u201cIraqi insurgents\u201d trying to track down a mysterious treasure. Oh, sure, filmmakers, by all means use a tragic and unnecessary war that\u2019s still yielding horrific consequences for the world as the backdrop for your stupid horror movie plot machinations, no problem here. Advertisement And, of course, there\u2019s the movie\u2019s very old-school sexism. \"The Mummy\" has two female characters: One is corrupt albeit not unattractive ancient Egyptian royal Ahmanet, who, once freed from her tomb in the present day, is the incarnation of all evil and stuff. (She is played by Sofia Boutella, whose filmography testifies that she\u2019s accustomed to being ill-used in motion pictures). The other is faux-archeologist/genuine anti-evil secret agent Jenny (Annabelle Wallis) who\u2019s mainly around to be rescued by Nick, and whose surface venality suggests that his business card describes him as a \u201clovable rogue.\u201d  So yes, should one choose to take offense, one certainly may. But I have to be honest\u2014speaking of venality, I found something almost admirable about the film\u2019s cheek. It\u2019s amazingly relentless in its naked borrowing from other, better horror and sci-fi movies that I was able to keep occupied making a checklist of the movies referenced. At its opening, remnants of a past civilization are discovered while workmen are tunneling underground for a new subway route. That\u2019s from \u201cQuatermass and the Pit,\u201d aka \u201cFive Million Miles to Earth.\u201d As many other reviewers have noted, once Jake Johnson\u2019s character buys in and is reborn as a wisecracking undead sidekick warning Nick about how he\u2019s been cursed by incarnation-of-evil Ahmanet, it\u2019s \u201cAmerican Werewolf in London\u201d time, albeit with PG-13-rated special effects rather than the side of ketchup-dipped corned beef that fell from Griffin Dunne\u2019s face in the earlier movie. What else? A woman whose kiss drains the life force out of those who receive it, from the wacky space-vampire movie \u201cLifeforce\u201d? Check. A brain-draining insect in the ear from \u201cStar Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\u201d? Check. Spavined slapstick undead assaulters out of \u201cEvil Dead\u201d? Check. Underwater fights with the undead out of Lucio Fulci\u2019s \u201cZombie\u201d? Check. (These too are toned down considerably from the source material.) Someone saying \u201cPlans?\u201d with the precise intonation Sir Ralph Richardson used in \u201cTales from the Crypt\u201d? Also check. Don\u2019t even get me started on the, um, appropriation of a famous line from the Universal monster movie \u201cBride of Frankenstein.\u201d But that\u2019s life, and that movie literally IS Universal\u2019s property.  There have been a lot of crocodile tears already shed about the fact that The Mighty Tom Cruise has allowed himself to be used in such dreck, and also that Russell Crowe has been compelled to continue to sink into a form of self-parody by appearing as the head of Jenny\u2019s anti-evil agency, a character named Dr. Henry Jekyll, and yeah, it\u2019s the same guy. Or some iteration of the same guy. As it happens, Dr. Jekyll was never one of the Universal Studios monsters, but the character IS in the public domain, so I guess the corporate overlords of the Dark Universe figured \u201cwhat the you-know-what.\u201d\u00a0  Advertisement Anyway, I cannot feel too aggrieved for either star. As Richard Harris and Richard Burton found out for themselves many years before Crowe came along, there comes a time in the career of every loose-cannon macho actor where the any-port-in-a-financial-year-storm approach to career management is all for the best. As for Cruise, he is known for his try-anything-once sense of cinematic adventure, and he does like his franchises. The Morton character is admittedly more of a callow nothingburger than any he\u2019s played. And given how the movie ends I\u2019m a little disappointed that he wasn\u2019t named Larry Talbot. But who knows, maybe he\u2019ll be obliged to change it for the next installment. Which I am looking forward to, out of nothing but base curiosity.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Ride", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Helen Hunt's second film as a director, \"Ride,\" is about a brittle book editor who heals old wounds and her strained relationship with her son by learning to surf. From its opening scenes, it settles into what seems like a familiar if very specific comic mode exemplified by such filmmakers as Woody Allen, Nancy Meyers (\"Something's Gotta Give\") and James L. Brooks (\"Broadcast News\" and \"As Good as it Gets,\" for which Hunt won an Oscar).\u00a0 The characters in these movies tend to be white, American, upper-middle class to rich, educated, and nervously talkative, and the whole thing tends to be pitched somewhere between a TV sitcom and a laid-back American indie film in which nothing too terribly upsetting happens onscreen. Lessons are learned, loves lost or found, quotable lines uttered, roll credits. None of which is meant to denigrate the movies as unworthy: well-done, they can be incredibly satisfying, and it's questionable whether they're any more or less trivial than a superhero film or \"Godzilla\" in the greater scheme (at least you get to see a version of the actual world on a movie screen). Just that usually you go in having a pretty good idea what you're in for, and you're rarely proven wrong. Advertisement \"Ride,\" though, is a somewhat different animal. Hunt, who directs her own original screenplay, nails the Allen-Meyers-Brooks aspect of the film from the opening scene, in which her heroine Jackie banters with her college-bound son Angelo (Brenton Thwaites) about a short story he's written. The rat-a-tat rhythm of the dialogue, complete with people talking over and past each other, is highly structured, every word and pause carefully chosen to put across a particular rhythmic or emotional effect. Nobody's just winging it here. The rest of the setup for the story is similarly meticulous, with dialogue scenes and bits of physical comedy blocked as meticulously as anything you might see in a Broadway play (one of the cleverest is the scene where Angelo allays his mom's fears that he's moving too far away from her by walking her across the park, counting each step along the way). We deduce that this is a movie about learning to let go, with an empty nest story at its center, and we figure it'll manifest itself by showing us that Jackie is a control freak, like a lot of older rom-com heroines, and that her son chafes at that even though he obviously has a touch of it himself, and that they're both going to have to get used to the idea of not being in each other's lives 24/7. But then Angelo goes to Venice, California to visit his father and his new family one last time before college and impulsively decides to drop out and just hang around the beach. Suddenly the whole temperament of the film changes, and you start to figure out that the tight-knit relationship between a single mother and her only son is not the main story here, but a gateway into the real main story. Suffice to say that once \"Ride\" gets around to explaining why Jackie and Angelo are so incredibly, perhaps unhealthily close (bickering and swapping in-jokes like a brother and sister, or an old married couple) and then has Jackie decide to stay in Venice for a while and learn to surf and open some long-locked doors in her psyche, the film goes darker than you expected it to go; but it explores that darkness with a plainspokeness that goes up to the edge of agonized psychodrama but somehow never punctures that feeling that Hunt established early on. This is a remarkable feat that required keen instincts to pull off. It's as if somebody had spliced bits of a French art house drama about grief, suffering and repression into \"Spanglish\" or \"It's Complicated,\" without one aspect canceling out the other. The film is high-strung, nervous and slightly chilly in the New York scenes, but once the action shifts to the beaches of Venice, it slows down considerably, and fittingly; the rhythm of the waves dictates the pace and color of the movie, and it makes sense to apply the brakes to a story about a woman who's always talking and working and running all over the place and defining and ranking and describing everything in her life. (Complaining about LA, she says, \"By the time you drive to a museum, you've lost the will to look at a painting, so it's hardly a decision based on culture\").  Advertisement The slowing-down effect of Venice makes it possible for Jackie to actually live in reality rather than hurrying through it or avoiding it. This in turn encourages her to confront the real reason she's so controlling towards Angelo and so incapable of letting him go. Without giving away the movie's big reveal (it's horrifying, in an everyday sort of way, but not \"surprising\" in a movie way) I can say that once we face it along with Jackie and Angelo and their loved ones, the film seems to go through much the same revelatory experience that Jackie has on the beach as she learns how to ride a board with help from a handsome, slightly younger instructor and soon-to-be-love-interest named Ian (Luke Wilson). It chills out and loosens up. And then it goes deep\u2014deeper than you expected\u2014into pain. There's a long, wordless sequence out in the ocean, just Hunt on a surfboard, that has the ritualistic power of a sacrament.  \"Ride\" isn't going to win any prizes for cinematic innovation. Its comfort in privilege has an irritatingly unexamined quality (Jackie's got the sort of job where she can fly cross-country for several days and drive to and from the beach in a limo and not be fired immediately). And there are aspects that feel more generous than dramatically wise, such as most of the scenes involving Angelo in LA; I think it would've been all right to let him be a supporting character after the film leaves New York and slip toward the margins of the story, which is mainly Jackie's. Still, this is an unusual movie, especially when you look back and realize how usual it seemed going in.  Certain actors seem to understand their screen persona better than almost any director they've worked with. Hunt might be one of them. She's often been cast as a killjoy, a micro-manager, a voice of reason, or a somewhat abstract figure of mystery and longing, and she's written a part for herself that incorporates all of those shards. (\"It sounds like hubris, but I know that once I get out there I am going to be better than average at intuiting how to do this,\" she says, explaining why she doesn't want surfing lessons at first.) But there's an earthier, warmer figure buried just beneath Jackie's surface, and the movie digs her out in a disarmingly natural way. Jackie can get high and laugh endlessly at a completely innocuous question, or march into her ex-husband's house and have a tearful meltdown that's been a long time coming while being keenly aware of how inappropriate and selfish it is, to the point of preemptively describing what she thinks the other characters in the room are thinking and feeling about her.  Advertisement The movie is funny until suddenly it's not funny at all. Then it's funny again while discussing the fact that some things really aren't funny. And near the end, it's affecting without seeming to try to hard to be affecting. A lot of this has to do with the way Hunt invests ordinary words with strong emotion by having the characters deliver them in an offhand way. \"Life is long,\" Ian tells Jackie. \"It is,\" she replies. I hope a lot of people see this movie. It's not great, but it has greatness in it, and as a filmmaker, Hunt is the real deal.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Queen of Katwe", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Director Mira Nair introduced her thoroughly crowdpleasing \u201cQueen\r\nof Katwe\u201d on Saturday night at the Toronto International Film Festival by quoting the slogan\r\nof a film school she has founded in Uganda, where she lives: \u201cIf we don\u2019t tell\r\nour own stories, no one will.\u201d That sense of ownership and authorship permeates \u201cQueen of Katwe,\u201d elevating it above your average feel-good biopic and allowing\r\nits message to feel not only inspirational but genuine. The story of Phiona\r\nMutesi is a fascinating one on its own, but what could have just been an\r\nextended \u201c30 For 30\u201d feels lived-in, compassionate and truthful. It helps\r\ngreatly to have not only Nair\u2019s clear love for her country guiding every\r\ndecision but also the amazing depth of David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong\u2019o to\r\nground it from most of its sentimental clich\u00e9s. Some of the dialogue in the\r\nfinal act feels a little false and manipulative, but those scenes stand out because it\u2019s been so believable up to that point.\u00a0 Advertisement The nuanced, subtle newcomer Madina Nalwanga plays\r\n10-year-old Phiona Mutesi, a young lady who lives in the slum of Katwe in\r\nKampala, Uganda. She has almost no possessions, can\u2019t read and sells maize in\r\nthe street to try to scrape together change for her family, which includes two\r\nbrothers, a sister, and her headstrong mother Harriet (Nyong\u2019o). Phiona and her\r\noldest brother Brian (Martin Kabanza) cross paths with a local sports ministry head named\r\nRobert Katende (Oyelowo). Recognizing that the slum kids he\u2019s working with\r\naren\u2019t going to compete at football, he decides to teach them something he\r\nmastered at a young age, the art of chess. It\u2019s a game that equalizes issues of\r\nclass, education and income. It can be played by anyone in the world, and\r\nKatende soon realizes that this young girl from Katwe has a special gift,\r\nespecially when she starts beating him. It\u2019s to be expected that the education segments of \u201cQueen of\r\nKatwe\u201d include a number of nods to how the game reflects Phiona\u2019s life, but\r\nthe execution doesn't feel heavy-handed. Nair is confident enough in her characters and\r\nthe story she\u2019s telling to avoid the pitfalls of repetitive lessons. So we get\r\nthe idea that Phiona likes the act of \u201cQueening\u201d because a pawn makes it all\r\nthe way across the board, against all odds, and becomes a Queen. We don\u2019t\r\nhear it 15 times like we would in a lesser film. When Katende explains the idea\r\nof finding a \u201csafe space\u201d whenever your opponent is on the offensive, it\u2019s easy to\r\ntranslate that to Phiona\u2019s real life but the movie doesn\u2019t hammer it in. This\r\nsubtle touch is undermined a bit in the final act as issues of Phiona\u2019s success\r\nand class conflicts start to tear the family apart in a way that feels manipulative\r\nand melodramatic, but Nair recovers by the end. Two of the reasons she manages to get the film back from the\r\nedge of treacle are right there in David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong\u2019o. The \u201cSelma\u201d\r\nstar is as charismatic as ever, capturing the kindness of a man who saw a\r\npotential escape for a young lady and did whatever he could to make it happen.\r\nOyelowo\u2019s work here is subtle but so consistent. He never looks like he\u2019s\r\nworking the message of the film more than the character he\u2019s playing. Opposite\r\nhim, Nyong\u2019o is phenomenal. She has an incredible ability to convey backstory.\r\nWe believe Harriet isn\u2019t merely a sounding board for our heroine or an\r\nemotional plot device. She feels real because of the intense passion that Nyong\u2019o\r\nbrings to her. And it\u2019s in the subtle things, like a glance that conveys fear about her family\u2019s future or the different tone she takes with each of her\r\nchildren. One also shouldn\u2019t miss how good Nalwanga is here, giving a fluid and physical performance. Advertisement Of course, much of the credit should go back to Nair and her\r\ntechnical team, who capture the streets of Uganda in a way we haven\u2019t really\r\nseen before, certainly not in a Disney film (Nair joked in the intro that it\r\nwas the first Disney film set in Africa that doesn\u2019t have a single animal in\r\nit). From the way Nair and her designer use costumes to convey economic status to how the great cinematographer Sean Bobbitt (\u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d) fluidly\r\ncaptures a corner of the world that makes it feel specific, \u201cQueen of Katwe\u201d is a team effort. With the combined efforts of Nalwanga,\r\nNair, Nyong\u2019o, Oyelowo, Bobbitt and many more, \u201cQueen of Katwe\u201d makes it clear\r\nthat we can\u2019t successfully tell \u201cour stories\u201d alone.

{"Title": "Playing It Cool", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Films about writers are tough enough. Films about writers\r\nwho think they\u2019re the smartest person in the room and too cool for the love story\r\nin which they\u2019re essentially starring are even more ill-advised. Such is one of\r\nthe many problems with \u201cPlaying It Cool\u201d, a movie that suffers greatly from its\r\ntendency to constantly remind you that \u201cThis is a Film About WRITERS.\u201d Our narrator\r\nnot only comments on the action of the piece incessantly, he\u2019s credited as \u201cMe\u201d.\r\nAnd the narcissism doesn\u2019t stop there. This \u201cMe\u201d constantly reminds us about\r\nhow differently writers see the world, how idiosyncratic they are, how smart\r\nthey are, how much better they are than you, etc. It\u2019s like being stuck in the head of a Creative Writing student who looks down on everyone else's major.\r\nAnd the film ultimately falls victim to the false assumption that highlighting clich\u00e9s\r\nmakes them easier to bear, when, in fact, I find the opposite true. Embrace\r\nyour manipulation, don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re above it before you use it. Only the\r\nreally strong cast, including great chemistry between the leads, keeps \u201cPlaying\r\nIt Cool\u201d from totally derailing. Advertisement Chris Evans plays the narrator, a lovelorn, one-night stand\r\ntype whose mom left him years ago with a note on the Cap\u2019n Crunch and whose\r\nheart isn\u2019t just on his sleeve, it\u2019s taken form and follows him around,\r\nchain-smoking. Then, of course, he gets smacked in the face with love when he\r\nmeets \u201cHer,\u201d played by the lovely Michelle Monaghan. It wouldn\u2019t be a movie if\r\nour object of desire was single, and so we get an uptight beau named \u201cStuffy\u201d\r\n(Ioan Gruffudd) to eventually overcome. More problematic for our hero is the\r\nfact that he doesn\u2019t really believe in the love in which he\u2019s falling. He talks\r\nthrough his concerns with writer friends Scott (Topher Grace), Lyle (Martin\r\nStarr), Mallory (Aubrey Plaza), and Samson (Luke Wilson)\u2014a group of characters\r\nso poorly realized that I started to wonder if they weren\u2019t all figments of our\r\nwriter\u2019s imagination.  \u201cPlaying It Cool\u201d is so self-consciously trying to convince\r\nviewers that it\u2019s the smartest romantic comedy in years that it never bothers\r\nto create characters. I\u2019m sure writer/director Justin Reardon thought he was\r\nbeing clever in his construction (unnamed characters who constantly comment on\r\ntheir own clich\u00e9d situations) but the result is an annoyingly pretentious piece\r\nof work. There\u2019s more \u201ccommentary\u201d about writing and love in \u201cPlaying It Cool\u201d\r\nthan actual romance or friendship. It defiantly fails the \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d\r\nargument. It is all telling. Which adds to how remarkable it is that Evans and Monaghan\r\nkeep the film from becoming totally unbearable. He\u2019s likely to always be most\r\nfamous for Captain America, but I\u2019ve always found him a likable actor\u2014believable,\r\ncharismatic, smart. Evans is up for anything. It\u2019s Reardon\u2019s fault that he\r\ndoesn\u2019t give him anything consistent to do. Evans\u2019 writer is a total narcissist\u2014he\r\nliterally puts himself in the leading roles of every story his writer friends tell\r\nhim. Lovely, right? And yet Evans is too likable to make this guy the total\r\nasshole he probably would be in real life. Similarly, while we never quite\r\nunderstand what Monaghan would see in him besides the physical, she\u2019s a typical\r\ndelight. She\u2019s another actress I\u2019d love to see get better work.

{"Title": "Concussion", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cI am the wrong person to have discovered this,\u201d Dr. Bennet Omalu, played in this movie by Will Smith, laments to his wife Prema, near the final quarter of \"Concussion.\" Omalu, a practitioner who has such pride in his profession that he corrects people who refer to him as \u201cMister\u201d with \u201cDoctor,\u201d but who is so kind-hearted, brilliant, enthusiastic and likable that the tic doesn\u2019t play here as irritating, is in an unusually American fix in this fact-based drama.\u00a0 \n Omalu is the real-life doctor who, while working as a forensic pathologist in Pittsburgh, discovered a new and terrifying brain disorder that he named Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. He discovered it performing an autopsy on a retired Pittsburgh Steeler named Mike Webster (movingly portrayed here by David Morse). Webster left the game as a hero and began losing his mind well before his death at fifty; scenes shortly before his death show him living in his pickup truck, huffing turpentine. A fellow player, himself to suffer a similar fate in the movie, tries to help him out. Neither man understands what\u2019s happening to them. Omalu figures it out:\u00a0 the persistent head injuries sustained in football play shake up the brain\u2014as the character explains, unlike some other mammals, humans don\u2019t have built-in shock absorbers for their grey matter\u2014and release a protein that builds up and causes hallucinations, memory loss, and much more trauma.\u00a0 Advertisement \n This film, written and directed by Peter Landesman and based in part on a 2009 magazine article, portrays Omalu as a cheerful, quietly religious man who, as a Nigerian-born immigrant, believes strongly in the American Dream, and believes that doing the right thing is part of that whole trip. The response his findings elicit from the NFL quickly prove him mistaken. As Omalu\u2019s boss and mentor, played by Albert Brooks with a nice mix of world-weariness and faith, puts it, Omalu is going up against an organization that \u201cowns a day of the week.\u201d Omalu thinks the NFL will be glad of his findings, and use some American ingenuity to do something about the problem. This is not what occurs. \n Will Smith\u2019s performance as Omalu is lovely: small-scaled, precise, imbued with righteousness but not tritely pious. One thing I\u2019ve noticed when Smith essays such a performance in a movie that\u2019s not entirely bad (and this movie is rather good): my fellow critics seem a little surprised. I don\u2019t understand why. Even since before his first \u201cserious\u201d film, an adaptation of the acclaimed stage play \u201cSix Degrees Of Separation,\u201d he was clearly a gifted and versatile performer. Although his career in recent years has admittedly encompassed a lot of work in which he more or less merely has to \u201cbe Will Smith,\u201d that hasn\u2019t necessarily led to a diminishment of his chops. He\u2019s also surrounded by expert players, including Alec Baldwin as a one-time team doctor who\u2019s both disturbed and stimulated by Omalu\u2019s findings, and who tries to build a bridge between Omalu and the stonewalling NFL, an effort that ends in teeth-gritting frustration.\u00a0 \n The movie also depicts Omalu\u2019s personal life. You know that feeling when you have no social life because you\u2019re devoted to your work and your church, and some of the church elders ask you to provide a room from a recent immigrant from abroad, and that immigrant turns out to look just like Gugu Mbatha-Raw? No, I don\u2019t either. But that\u2019s what happens to Smith\u2019s character, and soon enough Mbatha-Raw\u2019s character, Prema, is more than a roommate. The movie treats the couple\u2019s relationship, and their strong faith, with refreshing delicacy and respect. And Mbatha-Raw makes Prema more than a long-suffering helpmate as the hostility against Omalu and his findings begins to mount.\u00a0 Advertisement \n The movie is engaging and fascinating for much of its two hours. The editing, by Oscar-winner William Goldenberg (he won for \u201cArgo\u201d and also put together \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d for which he was also nominated), is brisk and inventive, managing to imbue excitement into montages in which Omalu is doing nothing more pulse-pounding than looking at a bunch of slides. Once Omalu finds fans, players, and the football industry itself giving him the very aggressive side-eye, the narrative begins to diffuse a bit. The movie isn\u2019t shy about implicating that NFL chief Roger Goodell (played here by Luke Wilson) is a corporate weasel and liar. But as certain bad things begin happening around Omalu and his colleagues and his wife, things grow vague; the movie, I suppose, can\u2019t just come out and SAY that the NFL is willing and able to do stuff that skirts \u201cParallax View\u201d/\u201dThree Days of the Condor\u201d territory. I found that this possibly involuntary discretion worked to the movie\u2019s advantage; the non-ratcheting up of the drama somehow made the story feel more true, more honest. The real story, in a sense, is how Omalu\u2019s belief in the goodness of some institutions came under assault, and how he refused to become a cynic even after all that. When he\u2019s called an American hero near the end of the movie, the truth of that phrase, as well as all the contradictions that trail in its wake, are vividly felt.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Endless", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "If you have a good idea, a strong cast, a smart script, and directorial chops, you don't need a lot of money to make a compelling movie. \"The Endless\" is proof.\u00a0Overseen by the filmmaking team of Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead\u2014who specialize in brainy meta-horror, and who star as brothers who decide to revisit the UFO cult where they grew up\u2014this is a movie that plays with our perceptions of time, space, and reality, and\u00a0sketches the outlines of unimaginable terror while leaving the details to our imagination.\u00a0 Advertisement Like much of the cast, Benson and Moorhead play characters who share the performers'\u00a0real-life first names\u2014a common indie filmmaking affectation that wouldn't raise an eyebrow if this were a drama, but that adds one more layer of oddness in a science-fiction film. Justin is the older brother, Aaron the younger. They grew up in a compound in a hilly stretch of forest somewhere in Southern California (the movie was shot near San Diego). The story begins with Justin and Aaron living an anonymous life as regular citizens. The opening scenes reveal that Justin \"rescued\" Aaron and took both of them out of\u00a0the cult. Then Aaron watches a videotaped message from a once-fellow cult member, Callie Hernandez's Anna, and realizes he misses the place even though he knows it was bad for him. He tells Justin that he\u00a0wants to go back for \"closure.\" Justin thinks this is a bad idea but agrees, out of love for his brother and because, on some deep level, he misses it, too. Things get weird before the brothers even reach the compound, thanks to an atmosphere of mystery and menace realized with clever sound design, a synthesized score (by James Lavelle) that samples \"House of the Rising Sun\" and evokes the best of John Carpenter; and unexplained images that recur. This story is filled with circles, and circles within circles. Or maybe we should call them \"saucer shapes.\" There's an overcast sky with a hole punched through the clouds; round wind chimes clinking in in the breeze; wooden benches arranged around a campfire. Circles are embedded into\u00a0the score itself: \"House of the Rising Sun\" is built around a series of circular chord patterns, and the\u00a0lyrics are about a gambler's son who escaped an abusive childhood but seems determined to repeat his father's sins by choice.\u00a0Mirrors are as important, too.\u00a0There are actual mirrors in the film, mirrored compositions, characters whose fates or personalities seem to mirror each other, and moments where the universe seems to tear a hole in itself and show us what's on the other side.\u00a0 Things become unmoored from scientifically verifiable truth. We enter the psychic terrain of horror films that make us doubt our perceptions. There are so many strange moments and images, most of them tossed-off, that if you list them all without context, as I'm doing here, it sounds as if your brain is fragmenting. Which, of course, is the point of telling the story as Benson and Moorehead tell it: form follows function here, and the subject is the way cult brainwashing and isolation combine to destroy the ability to distinguish fantasy from reality.  Advertisement Characters keep taking trips of various distances (anywhere from hundreds of miles to a few feet) only to end up where they started. Sometimes they experience and re-experience the same events from the same angle, or a slightly different angle. Do they have free will, or did their psychological conditioning by the cult turn that into one more illusion, like the strange images they encounter around the camp?\u00a0Do they make choices, or do choices make them? The cult prides itself on having no leader, but is this true? There's a quiet, reactive fellow named Tim (Lew Temple) who has a bushy red beard, long red hair, an angular face, and the authoritative demeanor of a tribal chief. He's pictured standing beside the door of a shack that's been sealed with a huge, 19th-century looking padlock: nobody ever goes in there. There are throwaway lines about how particular characters in the film are a lot older than Aaron and Justin, even though they're played by actors their age or slightly younger.\u00a0  I'm being vague about the plot on purpose, because it's ultimately not the main focus of \"The Endless,\" and because so much\u00a0of the film's effectiveness comes from comparing what we're told would happen against what actually does happen (or what appears to happen). The circular visual motifs and circular (or repetitive) plotting evokes films that examine karma, evolution, free will and destiny by confronting their characters with variations of the same challenges over and over again: think of\u00a0\"Edge of Tomorrow,\" \"Groundhog Day\" and \"Looper.\"  The film seems to be set sometime before or immediately after the dawn of the 21st century, judging from the video technology and flip phones and apparent lack of Internet access, but we can't be sure.\u00a0As the movie goes on, even older technology starts to appear, some of it so visibly filthy or damaged (or so divorced from necessary accessory tech, such as as batteries or cords) that there's no way it could work; but of course it does work, conveying messages that seem generated by malevolent forces. A simple card trick that Justin smugly sees through gives way to a trick involving a baseball, so impervious to rational explanation that it chills the blood. And let's not get into the trip the brothers take in a rowboat, or the uncanny events that seem to occur whenever\u00a0Justin goes running.  Advertisement All of the lead performances are superb. The best are probably Moorhead; Benson; Hernandez; Kira Powell as the kind of glassy-eyed kook that Shelly Duvall used to specialize in; and James Jordan as a Dennis Hopper-like babbling lunatic named Shitty Carl. But it's hard to choose. Everybody's giving their all here. And the blatantly \"big\" performance moments are balanced out by numerous, just-right grace notes, such as the teasing, familiar, brotherly way that Justin and Aaron talk to each other, and the zonked-out, practically affectless way Powell's character corrects Justin, telling her that a meth-head hermit she just described to him wasn't a boyfriend, but \"just this guy I was sort of obsessed with, when I was on lithium, Thorazine and PCP.\" The filmmaking is mostly restrained and intelligent, strategically framing characters, moving the camera to reveal or conceal information, and amping up tension with surprising edits, dissonant sound effects, and Lavelle's music, which is so unsettling that I would not be surprised to learn that it was performed on a keyboard made from frayed human nerve endings. Not every moment in the film works: the lead actors overdo it a bit during the opening section, which unfortunately showcases some terrible, exposition-dump dialogue, and the CGI is dodgy in a way that's characteristic of moviemakers whose artistic ambitions exceed their budgets.\u00a0 But it's ultimately the suggestions, implications and shock effects that put the story over the top, as well as the emphasis on the characters' neuroses and longings. What these brothers are ultimately searching for is a place to call home. It doesn't matter to them if it's a cult compound full of deluded, psychologically destructive manipulators or some sort of intergalactic prison, torture compound or zoo (or whatever this place\u00a0is), as long as they know their way around, and are surrounded by faces they recognize.\u00a0The camp is their House of the Rising Sun.\u00a0These two have\u00a0one foot on the platform, the other on a train, and they've gone back to the compound to swing that ball and chain.

{"Title": "The Family I Had", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Katie Green & Carlye Rubin\u2019s \u201cThe Family I Had,\u201d which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and will air on Investigation Discovery\u00a0tomorrow night, December 21st, is an undeniable tragedy. What makes it a more interesting film than it might otherwise have been is its filmmakers willingness to recognize that there are no easy answers to questions that no one should ever have to ask. It is a story about a murder that tears a family apart and how the people who remain navigate an entirely different world than the one they were in the day before. And it presents an impossible situation for its central figure, someone who has to live the rest of her life with questions of regret and forgiveness that it\u2019s impossible to really even imagine considering much less finding the answers that would make one sleep easier at night. Advertisement That impossible situation belongs to Charity, a woman who was working her job at BW3s one night when she got a call that would forever change her life. Ella, her 4-year-old daughter, was dead. And her 13-year-old son Paris was being held for her murder. Paris had grabbed a knife and stabbed his sister to death, claiming on the 911 call that he believed the toddler was a demon (however, his own mother claims this story and the call are merely a story concocted by a boy, it\u2019s suggested, wasn\u2019t getting the attention he demanded). Immediately, Charity was faced with an impossible situation. As she says in heartbreaking interviews, if she tried to get Paris the help he so clearly needed, she wondered if she\u2019d be betraying the memory of Ella. But if your son was mentally ill, would you let the system lock him up and throw away the key?    Green and Rubin keenly understand the complexity of what they\u2019re covering. \u201cThe Family I Had\u201d is, thankfully, not an \u201cexplainer\u201d movie. It\u2019s not the kind of thing that\u2019s going to tell you exactly why Paris did what he did. Were his cries for attention ignored before that fateful night? What about his mother\u2019s substance abuse problems? What about the missing fathers in this narrative? What about cycles of emotional abuse? Or how our system really has no idea what to do with a sociopathic child, much less a single mother in Abilene, Texas? And then the narrative here takes a twist in the family tree that you won\u2019t see coming and offers another layer of debate to the nature vs. nurture issues at the core of this human tragedy.    And that\u2019s the key to this project\u2019s success\u2014the filmmakers never lose sight of the human beings looking for answers to impossible questions. Charity has another child after Paris goes into a system that will release him at the age of 33. She now has to worry about what Paris may do to her new child once he\u2019s out. Could he really do it again? Can you imagine watching someone who killed your child interact with another one? No, you can\u2019t. None of us can. And \u201cThe Family I Had\u201d recognizes the impossible situation in which Charity has been placed, and then memorably shows us how she has to move forward, one day at a time, one foot in front of the other.

{"Title": "The Family", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Life is tough in the Witness Protection Program. Life is pretty cushy, too, especially if you're the Manzoni family in Luc Besson's \"The Family\": you get to live in a quaint house in a tiny village in Normandy, you eat well, you have FBI guys stationed across the street 24/7, and you have a personal handler who makes sure that you and your loved ones are safe. The point of being in Normandy for the Manzonis is to somehow \"pass\" as regular Americans on holiday or sabbatical, and the Manzonis fail to manage this from the start, mainly because they are all raging maniacs.\u00a0 Advertisement \"The Family\" is a pretty uneven film, lurching from comedy to violence to sentiment, but it's best when it sticks in the realm of flat-out farce. The pleasure comes in watching the actors (Michelle Pfeiffer, in particular) submitting wholeheartedly to ridiculous situations. The film has a mix of influences and genres, obviously, and Besson plays with these and references them openly, but the farcical elements rest uneasily beside the violence, leaving the unmistakeable feeling that this is a film slightly at war with itself.\u00a0 When dealing with the family's adjustment (or lack thereof) to small-town French life, it is on sure (and often hilarious) footing.\u00a0Giovanni Manzoni (Robert De Niro) snitched on his Mafia friends back in the States, and because of that there is now a $20 million price on his head. In exchange for his testimony, he and his family (wife and two teenage kids, Belle and Warren) are placed in the Witness Protection Program, under the control of FBI agent Robert Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones). Maggie Manzoni (Pfeiffer) is already sick of the life in hiding, and has a tiny habit of blowing stuff up when she gets upset. Of course placing a well-known Mob boss into a tiny village in France doesn't seem like the best strategy for the FBI, because the witness will stick out even more there, but you really can't ask those questions when you watch \"The Family.\" The answers will not hold up under interrogation. The film opens with the family (Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Dianna Agron, and John D\u2019Leo) driving through the French countryside to yet another hideout since their cover was blown in the Riviera. The two kids loll bored in the back seat, Giovanni tries to tell everyone the new place will be fine, everything will be okay, the dog gets blamed for the bad smell in the car (when actually it is the stink of a dead corpse in the trunk, hidden there by Giovanni on his way out of Nice). This opening scene contains everything that is good and pleasurable about the film: watching Pfeiffer and De Niro act with one another, the weird juxtaposition of violence and everyday family matters, the family's anxiety at being in France when they'd rather be in Brooklyn. You are lulled into a false sense that you understand what is going on here\u2014that the father, Giovanni Manzoni (Robert De Niro) is the \"wise guy,\" and his family is just along for the ride. But the next couple of scenes explode that sense of safety (literally) as you realize that all of them, all four of them, are out of their minds.  Advertisement Belle and Warren size up their new small-town school and promptly begin to wreak havoc among their peer group. In a matter of days, Warren has taken over 50% of the blackmarket cigarette business, as well as the prescription pill business, and when he is told by a teacher that his conduct has been poor, he says he wants a lawyer. On her first day, Belle accepts a ride home with four French guys who tell her they want to \"practice their English,\" and when she realizes that maybe they want more from her, she beats one of the guys to a pulp with a tennis racket. Played by \"Glee\"'s Dianna Argon, Belle is a creepy character, gorgeous and innocent, but when she falls in love with her math tutor, you can't get the image of her smashing the tennis racket into another human being's face out of your mind. Meanwhile, Warren and Belle's parents are oblivious to what's happening in their children's lives. Giovanni thinks he might try his hand at a memoir, not a smart move for someone who is supposed to be in hiding. Maggie visits a local church, trying to re-connect to her faith. \u00a0Tommy Lee Jones shows up now and then to say it's hard to protect them if they insist on breaking the plumber's legs because he can't fix the pipes.  De Niro could play this role in his sleep, but he's fun to watch, especially in the scenes with Pfeiffer, and when his power is demeaned by his family's shenanigans. In one awesome sequence, the curator of a local film group calls up Giovanni and asks if he wouldn't come to their next meeting to have a nice debate on a great American film, Vincente Minnelli's \"Some Came Running\" (starring Frank Sinatra as an aspiring writer with a tormented past). Against the advice of Stansfield, Giovanni accepts. The head of the film society tells him they were sent \"Goodfellas\" by mistake, so maybe the visiting American would have something to say about that? Boy, does he ever. It's a giant wink to the audience, an inside joke, as we are treated to the bizarre vision of Robert De Niro as Giovanni Manzoni watching Robert De Niro as Jimmy in \"Goodfellas.\"  Pfeiffer's performance is the reason to see the film, though. Calling back her show-stopping turn in \"Married to the Mob,\" her Maggie is both supportive and bored out of her mind, yearning towards her old Catholic faith but unrepentant about blowing stuff up. She cooks at the stove, her hair in gigantic curlers. She kneels in church, praying to Jesus with earnest eyes. Pfeiffer has been very good in dramatic material, but she might be a comedienne at heart. There's one scene near the end of \"The Family\" where events are coming to a boil, buildings are exploding, and she crawls across the floor as quickly as she can clutching a gigantic kitchen knife. Her eyes are manic, wild, and yet also focused, like an assassin's.\u00a0 Luc Besson has built a career on stylish and thrilling action films, and \"The Family\" is a mess compared to such earlier efforts as \"Le Femme Nikita\" and \"L\u00e9on: The Professional.\" But for what it is, it works, while reminding us and again to not take it too seriously.

{"Title": "The Case Against 8", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"The Case Against 8,\" opening in limited release theatrically before an HBO debut on June 23, 2014, bears no pretense of objectivity. Look at the title. While it may not present \"both sides of the story,\" it thoroughly fulfills the promise of its title in presenting the legal battle against Proposition 8, the attempt to ban same-sex marriage in California. With remarkable access to the plaintiffs and legal team over the course of the five-year battle for equality, \"The Case Against 8\" starts as a relatively straightforward historical document about the specifics of the case but becomes something much deeper, and more emotional in the telling. As so often happens with stories of international importance such as the Supreme Court ruling on Prop 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act, we often lose sight of the men and women involved. \"The Case Against 8\" beautifully reminds us of the human beings who opened up their lives to the world and became representatives for one of the most important movements for equal rights this country has ever seen. Advertisement In May 2008, the California Supreme court legalized marriage for same-sex couples. 18,000 couples were married over the next few months but the backlash was almost immediate. By November of that year, a proposition was on the ballot to define marriage exclusively as being that between a man and a woman. As the country celebrated the election of Barack Obama, Prop 8 passed with 52% of the vote, resulting in a state amendment and the dissolution of thousands of partnerships in the eyes of the law.  The response was as swift as those who mounted the Prop 8 campaign. Activist Chad Griffin formed the American Foundation for Equal Rights and a chance meeting brought aboard one of the most important allies in the case against 8, Ted Olson, the former solicitor general under President George W. Bush. Olson was the man who argued one of the most important cases in decades, the one that determined that Bush would become President over Gore when Florida proved they were generally incapable of determining who won their state\u2019s delegates. Getting a conservative icon like Olson on the side of the case against 8 was a galvanizing, attention-grabbing move that proved to be the right decision. Olson is a passionate, stunningly intelligent man, who happens to be a conservative that believes in not just the legal cause for gay marriage but that all loving couples have the right on a moral level as well. His closing argument in \"The Case Against 8\" is one of the most passionate and moving I\u2019ve ever heard. Watching Olson depose witnesses to such an intellectual degree that he sometimes turns them from \"Yes on 8\" supporters to his cause is one of the film\u2019s great joys. Gay rights are often presented in film as emotional, moral causes, but Olson proves that they\u2019re intellectual, legal ones as well, often by turning their opponents\u2019 own logic against them. Who better to work with Ted Olson than the man who opposed him in Bush v. Gore, the equally impressive David Boies? And now they needed plaintiffs. After the kind of interview/vetting process that is a key part of most political campaigns, enter Kris Perry & Sandy Stier and Jeff Zarillo & Paul Katimi. \"The Case Against 8\" directors Ben Cotner and Ryan White never lose sight of the legal drama that\u2019s unfolding but perfectly place it in a foundation that\u2019s relatably human. We meet Kris & Sandy\u2019s sons, who had to each individually agree to be a part of the case before their mothers would place that spotlight on their family. And we spend a lot of emotional time with Jeff & Paul, two men who just wanted to live their lives together but became focal points of an entire movement. One easily loses sight of how much pressure they must have felt to represent gay marriage as a whole. What if they had lost? Advertisement As we all know, they didn\u2019t. And \"The Case Against 8\" feels like a victory speech. It\u2019s a well-made, moving, informative history that I first worried was too soon to tell; historical documentaries often require a bit more time from the key events to really place them in context. However, as the final act of this HBO film proves, we\u2019ve come an amazingly long way since that day in 2008 when men and women voted against gay marriage. There\u2019s still a long way to go but \"The Case Against 8\" deftly and emotionally chronicles one of the most important legs of this journey for equality.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Fencer", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The extent to which American film practice continues to influence some sectors of overseas moviemaking is both impressive and a little dispiriting. \u201cThe Fencer,\u201d an Estonian/Finnish/German co-production whose story is based on a real-life sports figure and teacher, begins with its protagonist, Endel, on board a train; after he disembarks, the camera follows him from behind, and the director, Klaus H\u00e4r\u00f6, arranges a series of shots that keep the character\u2019s back in the same position in the frame as he moves from train station to an indoor corridor to another corridor and so on, until he reaches his final destination, an office where he\u2019s reporting for his new job. This kind of clever gesture has the redolence of indie flair; the soft lighting throughout is meant to evoke a certain nostalgia (despite the fact that the setting and period of the movie, Soviet Estonia in the early 1950s, is not one most who were there tend to be nostalgic about, although in fairness sometimes you never know), and when Endel sits before his interviewer, we know he\u2019s going to end up as the bad guy because the actor playing him looks rather like Dylan Baker and wears orange-rimmed round spectacles that practically scream \u201cobedient bureaucrat.\u201d  Advertisement \u201cThe Fencer\u201d is largely a quiet and understated movie. Endel, played by M\u00e4rt Avandi, has a lean and haunted look from the start. At his job interview, the school principal and eventual bad guy, Hendrik Toompere, notes that Endel, who\u2019s to be the new phys ed instructor at a secondary school in Haapsalu, has listed \u201cfencing\u201d as among his skills, and comments \u201cNot a sport for the working man.\u201d Endel agrees, but in his off hours, he gets in a little practice at the sport, and is soon spied doing so by one of his younger female students, who is intrigued. So Endel starts a fencing club at the school. He is initially frustrated: \u201cQuite frankly I\u2019m not good with children,\u201d he confides to Kadri (Ursula Ratasepp), a fellow teacher with whom he will, yes, become romantically involved. But he improves. And the kids improve. To one of them, Jaan, a fellow whose home life is constantly upended by KGB types coming to his house and taking away a family elder, he says \u201cI will make you a fencer.\u201d Things move along well enough until one of the students becomes aware of a school fencing tournament to be held in Leningrad. Which is where Endel came from, looking for a place to hide out. From what is hinted at first in an on-screen text before the narrative begins; Endel then explains his situation to Kadri.  But in this movie of story beats, this is the one where the protagonist must make the decision: whether to let down his kids by saving his own skin, or not. The beats that follow are predictable, albeit more understated than how they\u2019d play out in a \u201cKarate Kid\u201d film. But they\u2019re still the same beats, within a sport that the viewer may not be too familiar with but which director H\u00e4r\u00f6 distills to some cinematically-friendly basics so that the viewer might savor the emotional satisfaction of the likable characters\u2019 victories. Finally, to provide a requisite happier ending, the movie invokes the little-known Stalin\u2019s Death Loophole.  None of this is particularly difficult to watch; the cinematic competence, the sincerity with which the clich\u00e9s get served up, and so on, make a relatively smooth viewing experience. But they also render what would have been an at times harrowing real-life story into something safe and bland.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "McCanick", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "When\r\n fans of beloved character actor David Morse say that they wish he could\r\n star in his own movie, \"McCanick\" is not what they have in mind. As \r\ndirected by Josh C. Waller and written by Daniel Noah, the movie is a \r\ntedious, often incompetently assembled mass of cop-on-the-edge clich\u00e9s.\u00a0 Morse\r\n stars as the title character, a grizzled Philadelphia police detective.\r\n The movie follows McCanick over the course of a single workday, his \r\n59th\u00a0birthday, as he rampages through the city, busting heads and \r\nscreaming threats. In theory, this chaos is in service of tracking down a\r\n recently released felon named Simon Weeks (Cory Monteith), a street \r\nhustler whom McCanick put behind bars seven years earlier. But it's \r\nreally in service of standard-issue dirty cop mayhem. Advertisement As\r\n clumsily written flashbacks pile up, we piece together the bigger \r\npicture of McCanick's history with Weeks: they met while McCanick was \r\ninvestigating a politician's murder. McCanick's commanding officer \r\n(Ciaran Hinds) hints that sleeping dogs should be let lie, but McCanick \r\nwon't listen; we discover the terrible secret that binds McCanick to \r\nWeeks, but only after enduring a repetitive series of \"searing\" \r\nconfrontations between the hero and various perps, accomplices, and \r\nrandom citizens, including a scene in which McCanick intimidates a \r\nroomful of tough guys by playing \"spin the pistol.\" There's\r\n also an unremarkable mentor-pupil relationship, with McCanick training a\r\n handsome young patrolman (Mike Vogel) who does things by the book and \r\nis appalled by the hero's can't-make-an-omelette-without-breaking-skulls\r\n attitude. The movie seems content to alternate between imitating \"Bad \r\nLieutenant\" and imitating \"Training Day,\" minus the genuine spiritual torment \r\nof the former and the sleek preposterousness of the latter.\u00a0 With\r\n his menacing bulk and soulful eyes, Morse lends the material more \r\ndignity and heft than it deserves, and there are a few affecting moments\r\n between him and Monteith, who died of a heroin overdose last year at \r\n31. (This is his final screen performance.) The movie has a suitably unsettling look, somewhere between a TV-14 cable police drama and a poverty row film noir. Waller and cinematographer Martin Alghren embrace darkness, favoring silhouettes and half-shadowed faces when they're justified, and sometimes when they aren't. A few scenes play much longer than you expected, generating an odd tension. You wonder: Are we still here because the filmmakers don't know when to quit, or because they're lulling us into complacency to set up a sucker punch? But none of these virtues \u00a0compensate for the film's shallow, derivative script and direction. \r\nWhen a goon in the spin-the-pistol scene asks McCanick \"what are you \r\nPopeye f------g Doyle?\" it seems meant as a self-aware preemptive \r\nstrike against criticism, but it's merely descriptive. \"McCanick\" barely\r\n has a frame it can claim as its own. It shambles\u00a0in the shadows of similar but richer films, and never hits its own stride.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cRumble,\u201d the guitar instrumental recorded by Link Wray in 1957, is to modern rock music what the monolith was to those primates in the \u201cDawn of Man\u201d section of \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d If you\u2019re ever on a quest for The Thing Itself in amplified music, \u201cRumble\u201d is a convincer. Sure, Chuck Berry invented licks and riffs and a worldview that invented \u201crock n roll,\u201d but Wray, with a surly distorted tone that one-upped the broken-amplifier crackle of Ike Turner\u2019s axe on \u201cRocket 88,\u201d helped invent \u201crock.\u201d Hendrix, hard rock, heavy metal all owe him big.  Advertisement He\u2019s the launching pad for this movie about Native Americans (here called \u201cIndians\u201d for reasons that become clearer as the movie goes on) and their influence not just on rock but on American music. As is pointed out more than once, the music of the Shawnee, the Choctaw, the Mohawk, the Apache, and so many other tribes, is in a very real sense the first American music. Race-mixing between blacks and Indians resulted in a cultural consciousness that enabled a melding of African music and Indian. Among other things, the movie makes a convincing case that the Indian tradition was one explicitly drawn upon by Charlie Patton, one of the giants of Delta Blues. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. The movie, directed by Catherine Bainbridge with Alfonso Maiorana, begins with Wray. And the section devoted to him is actually the weakest one in the movie. As if wanting to convince the viewer as to its authoritativeness, it mixes scintillating archival footage of the badass guitarist, from clean-cut-with-pomaded-hair \u201850s incarnation to leather-clad \u201870s Gibson SG mangler with a parade of talking heads talking about how significant \u201cRumble\u201d was. I enjoy hearing from Steven Van Zandt, the MC5\u2019s Wayne Kramer, Slash, music critic David Fricke et. al. as much as the next enthusiast, but after a while I\u2019m thinking, \u201cInstead of talking so much about \u2018Rumble,\u2019 how about letting us actually HEAR more of it?\u201d  It\u2019s also peculiar that the movie drops Wray pretty much right after giving us the news that \u201cRumble\u201d was banned from a host of radio stations, a signal accomplishment for an instrumental. \u201cThe theme song of juvenile delinquency,\u201d Van Zandt says, delightedly. Wray\u2019s subsequent career was as action-packed and eccentric as any rock figure you can name, and it doesn\u2019t get played out here. Maybe they\u2019re saving it for a separate documentary.  But the stories the film tells after Wray\u2019s are mostly well-done and frequently moving mini-movies. A section in New Orleans, featuring local hero Monk Boudreaux and several members of the Neville Brothers, is a superb pr\u00e9cis of the roots of that region\u2019s infectious music. Buffy Sainte Marie speaks of becoming a musician by happenstance, and suffering under a blacklist she wasn\u2019t even explicitly aware of for almost twenty years. Robbie Robertson recount his procession from journeyman teen guitarist to Bob Dylan\u2019s wingman during his controversial switch from folk to rock. \u201cBe proud you\u2019re an Indian but be careful who you tell,\u201d he recalls his people advising him. The movie also examines the Indian roots in the work of Mildred Bailey, a pioneer for female jazz singers and a profound influence on some male superstars who came after her, one of whom, Tony Bennett, appears in an interview.  Advertisement And there are heartbreaking stories, especially the one of Jessie Ed Davis, the spectacular guitar player who worked with blues singer Taj Mahal in the \u201960s. Allman Brothers Band member Butch Trucks recently told an interviewer that one reason the band long declined to put a studio recording of its rendition of \u201cStatesboro Blues\u201d on an album was they felt it was just a second-string copy of what Taj and Davis had done on their first album. Davis\u2019 adoption by British rockers led to a high life that unfortunately plunged Davis into junkiedom. Cleaned up, Davis teamed with Native American activist and poet John Trudell for the great \u201cAKA Grafitti Man\u201d project. In the film, Trudell (who was interviewed prior to his own 2015 passing) says of Davis, \u201cHe set me on my way, and then he checked out.\u201d  The movie goes down byways you might not have expected: Taboo from Black Eyed Peas makes an appearance, and heavy metal shows up via both guitarist Steve Salas (one of the movie\u2019s executive producers) and drummer Randy Castillo, who played with Ozzy. Their stories are among the movie\u2019s most moving. Appropriately, \u201cRumble\u201d ends at Standing Rock, North Dakota, with the sight of indigenous people protesting the Keystone pipeline, confronted by faceless authority figures who look ready to beat them down. The struggle continues. \u201cWe\u2019re right and the world is wrong,\u201d as Robertson said he came to believe in the period when he and Bob Dylan were practically getting booed off the stage every night.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Armor of Light", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cThe Armor of Light\u201d begins with footage from a 1992 anti-abortion rally, in which one of the protest\u2019s leaders, a minister, is seen cradling a preserved human fetus in his hands. This gentleman, the Reverend Robert Schenck, happens to be the protagonist of the documentary.\u00a0 \n I\u2019ll put my cards on the table, for what it\u2019s worth. I\u2019m what some would call \u201cpro-choice\u201d and I am neither moved nor engaged by tactics such as the one used by Reverend Schenck. Regardless, one supposes that the footage does establish what some would call Schenck\u2019s \u201cpro-life\u201d credentials, and once the movie has done so, Schenck narrates an event that would change his life: the 1998 murder, or assassination if you please, of Dr. Bernard Slepian, an abortion provider who was killed by an anti-abortion activist. \u201cI was more than shocked, I was stunned,\u201d Schenck says, going on to say that he just couldn\u2019t believe that anyone \u201cpro-life\u201d would actually take a life. \u201cI was na\u00efve,\u201d he concludes. Gee, you think? Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it seems relatively clear that the rhetoric used by those from Schenck\u2019s camp is frequently on the heated-to-the-point-of-inflammatory side. There\u2019s not much hate-the-sin-love-the-sinner going on in this debate.\u00a0 Advertisement \n In any event, Schenck was genuinely moved, because he took a hard, detailed look at the gun culture within the wide-ranging evangelical community in the United States, and decided to \u2026 well, to question it. Schenck, as this documentary from co-directors Abigail Disney and Kathleen Hughes demonstrates, is not exactly an anti-gun crusader. Rather, he seeks to imbue a spirit of mindfulness to his flock. To just think about the potential contradictions within deeming oneself both \u201cpro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-gun.\u201d For merely suggesting such a thing, he gets a lot of pushback.\u00a0 \n Intersecting Schenck\u2019s story is that of Lucia McBeth, a flight attendant whose son was shot to death by Michael Dunn after a service-station conflict over music coming from the vehicle in which victim Jordan Davis sat. Davis was African-American, Dunn white. Dunn invoked Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws, which had recently served George Zimmerman so well, to justify his actions.\u00a0 \n So yes: this movie pokes its camera eye into about a dozen distinct forms of controversy. And yet \u201cThe Armor of Light\u201d is a calm, measured, and very visually attractive film (each and every shot that\u2019s not from archival or found footage is meticulously composed and executed; Disney & Hughes do NOT do \u201cB-roll\u201d), one that holds conclusions at arm\u2019s length.\u00a0 \n While drawing compelling portraits of Schenck, McBeth, and McBeth\u2019s family lawyer John Phillips, the movie also provides some peculiar glimpses into the aforementioned gun culture. Archival footage shows NRA head Wayne LaPierre proclaiming, \u201cThe only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.\u201d Later in the film, at a quiet meeting with fellow evangelicals (which opens with a prayer, even), an Operation Rescue member earnestly parrots those exact words to Schenck. It\u2019s like something out of \u201cThey Live,\u201d or Orwell. The same fellow also utters the catchphrase \u201cAn armed society is a polite society,\u201d and goes on to explain that two people who meet on the street who both know that the other is armed are not going to shoot each other, which begs the question of why they were going to shoot each other in the first place. In other scenes, several church-going folk discuss a fantasy scenario in which a child molester is luring a kid into a van but is stopped by a gun-toting parishioner. When has this ever happened, really? There\u2019s a tendency among some folks to try and bolster LaPierre\u2019s position by sending skeptics a blog post from Controversial Times, or some other highly reliable website, about the dozen or so times that a good guy with a gun HAS stopped a bad guy with a gun. I don\u2019t know what the actuarial tables make of this, given that the number of times this hasn\u2019t happened is well over a dozen but \u2026 oh, good grief.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Disney and Hughes' film, for all its evenhandedness of tone, is clearly in Schenck and particularly McBath\u2019s corner; it regards the conviction of Dunn as a triumph for common sense and justice. For all that, the film\u2019s calmness, and its roundabout approach to narrative\u2014somewhat unavoidable given the structure Disney & Hughes choose, which is to tell a lot of the story more or less as it happens rather than in retrospect\u2014diffuse some of its power. The overwhelming and slightly dispiriting (for this viewer, at least) note that \u201cThe Armor Of Light\u201d ends on is that the road ahead for Schenck is a long one, and the folks he wants to persuade along that road are not easily swayed from their reflexive disdain of a \u201cnanny state.\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "After the Storm", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Hirokazu Kore-eda has drawn comparisons to Yasujiro Ozu in the way he\u2019s not as interested in major plot twists or set pieces as he is subtle human emotion, typically hinging on family dynamics. In films like \u201cNobody Knows,\u201d \u201cAfter Life\u201d and \u201cStill Walking\u201d (the three best of an incredible career if you\u2019re looking for a place to start), he turns the camera into a window. We look through it and see people a lot like us on the other side, but that empathy never comes through manipulation or clich\u00e9. With his latest, the remarkably moving \u201cAfter the Storm,\u201d he again finds truth and drama in relatable human behavior, and does so by sketching fully-realized, three-dimensional characters. \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d is about a man unable to live in the present. He is always longing for what he\u2019s lost or dreaming about what he has yet to achieve. And it\u2019s destroying him. We\u2019ve all been there. We\u2019ve all waded in regret and felt skeptical about the future. \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d is one of our best filmmaker\u2019s best films. Advertisement Ryota (Hiroshi Abe) has understandable reasons for his depression. He\u2019s a prize-winning author, but he has yet to follow up on the success of his novel, The Empty Table. He has a job working as a private detective, but it doesn\u2019t seem to bring him much joy\u2014and it\u2019s a profession that plays into Kore-eda\u2019s themes as Ryota is always looking at other people\u2019s lives instead of his own. He\u2019s taken to bringing along his P.I. colleague on surveillance of his ex-wife Kyoko (Yoko Maki), who has a new beau. Even though Ryota has never met the new man in Kyoko\u2019s life, he feels challenged by him, especially when it comes to the attention of his son Shingo (Taiyo Yoshizawa). One night, during a typhoon, Ryota finds himself stuck in his mother\u2019s (the amazing Kirin Kiki) apartment with Shingo and Kyoko. There are no grand revelations or emotional breakdowns, just a series of heartfelt conversations, but the sunlight looks a bit different the next day. \u201cAfter the Storm\u201d is as delicately balanced as any film Kore-eda has made, a film that seems to not have much action or momentum but finds cumulative emotional power. Ryota worries about his mother now that his father has passed; he spies on his ex and son; he gambles more than he should\u2014he lives in the past, always talking about his now-broken family, his father, his childhood. And he has a certain victimhood to his tone when he does so, as if life dealt him a bad hand and it\u2019s not his fault. There\u2019s an almost throwaway moment\u2014although Kore-eda\u2019s films are so finely balanced they contain no such thing\u2014in which Ryota and his partner tell a client about a cheating husband, and she doesn\u2019t respond as emotionally as they expect, saying \u201cFor better or worse, it\u2019s all part of my life.\u201d It's that comfort with life's speedbumps and the fact that they shape us as much as anything. Ryota is the kind of guy who gives money to his mother and then asks to borrow some from his sister. He so desperately wants to impress those about whom he cares deeply, and he confuses material goods and cash flow with actual communication and attention. Notice how he doesn\u2019t eat when he takes his son out for a meal\u2014he can\u2019t afford it\u2014and he totally wastes the chance to get to know him by grilling the boy about the new man in his mother\u2019s life. Perfectly directed by Kore-eda, Hiroshi Abe gives one of the best performances in any of his films. He has the perfect hangdog face: unable to make eye contact easily, uncombed hair and unshaven.

{"Title": "Battle of the Sexes", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Going into \u201cBattle of the Sexes,\u201d one might expect an equally-balanced look at the lives of self-proclaimed chauvinist Bobby Riggs and tennis superstar Billie Jean King. This is not that movie. And it shouldn\u2019t be really. The best angle of the film is the way it illuminates the difference between fighting for equality and battling to hold on to perceived superiority. Of course, this is a fight that continues to this day, and not just in terms of gender. If anything, there\u2019s a better version of \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d that focuses even more fully on King, villainizing Riggs and his grotesque culture of sexism in a way this movie disappointingly seems scared to do. The material involving King\u2019s fight for equality is powerful, and the performances are uniformly strong, but there\u2019s a TV movie approach to the emotion and truth of this situation that softens it in detrimental ways. It\u2019s not a \u201cbad\u201d film, but Billie Jean King\u2019s story could have been so much deeper. It\u2019s a movie that doesn\u2019t hit nearly as hard as she did. Advertisement King is played by the Oscar-winning Emma Stone, who captures her unique blend of determined grit and awkward social behavior. Her take on King is relatively shy and spotlight-averse, the opposite of the gregarious Bobby Riggs, portrayed by Steve Carell. A gambling addict, the 55-year-old Riggs has lost his drive, looking for the next hustle to keep him happy, even as his bad habits frustrate his wife, played in a totally thankless role by Elizabeth Shue. When the head of the Tennis Association, played with an almost caricature degree of smarm by Bill Pullman, offers a tournament in which the female winner will get $1,500 while the male winner gets $12,000, King jumps ship, and she takes almost every female tennis player that matters with her. Led by Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman), the ladies form their own tennis tour, and the world notices, including Bobby Riggs. While Riggs is looking for his next big thing, King is confronted with something she didn\u2019t expect, a romance with her hairdresser, Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough). Happily married to Larry (Austin Stowell), Billie Jean never expected to fall in love with another woman, and it\u2019s the kind of affair that could destroy her career, especially as the new tour is trying to find sponsors. With this new romance as the backdrop, King ends up agreeing to a one-time match with Riggs, who believes that an over-the-hill male tennis player can still beat the #1 young, female tennis champion. While a lot of the people around her see this as just a gimmick, she realizes the message it could send to the world if she loses.  With copious amounts of \u201870s style and music, directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (\u201cLittle Miss Sunshine\u201d) work hard to recreate a period in which male chauvinism could still be very easily taken as a public position. It\u2019s hard to imagine a dinosaur like Bobby Riggs getting any attention beyond a small core of morons nowadays. Even if his brand of sexism is depressingly alive and well, it\u2019s not the kind of thing sports announcers openly defend. Listening to Howard Cosell and company legitimize Riggs\u2019 worldview shows how much of a culture King had to work to tear down. Advertisement However, it also makes one wonder why writer Simon Beaufoy didn\u2019t take a tougher stance against Riggs. Scenes with his wife and child are clearly designed to humanize him in a way that feels oddly disingenuous. At one point, he\u2019s a goofy charmer, but then we see how much larger a hill that King had to climb because of the Riggs brand of sexism and it\u2019s hard not wish the movie didn\u2019t too often treat him as a harmless clown. There\u2019s a better version of \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d that focuses more completely on just King because this half-developed, comedy approach to Riggs\u2019 life doesn\u2019t add enough to this version. As for performances, Dayton & Faris have always been strong with an ensemble, and that\u2019s true here as well. Stone is subtle and powerful, but Riseborough actually gives my favorite performance of the film, playing someone who feels more three-dimensional than the icons at the center of the piece. Similarly, Alan Cumming does a lot with just a few scenes, which isn\u2019t that unusual for him. Less fortunate are Shue and Pullman, turned into the archetypes of the Frustrated Wife and the Sexist Boss. The final scenes of Pullman sneering as he watches the match might as well have had him twirling a curled mustache. It\u2019s that superficial approach to the world around Billie Jean King that diminishes her story. Instead of a timeless story, this feels like a Hollywood production that softens what was truly and genuinely a battle, one that women are still fighting today.

The game night covered in this movie includes Ryan (Billy Magnussen), a dimwitted friend of Annie's; Sarah (Sharon Horgan), Ryan's much smarter date; the husband-wife team of Kevin and Michelle (Lamorne Morris and Kylie Bunbury); and Max's estranged brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler), who's a success in ways that Max can only dream about.\u00a0 Advertisement Then Brooks invites the guests out to his rich-guy house for a different kind of game night, modeled on those murder mystery dinner parties that became a fad a few years ago, and \"Game Night\" becomes a roller coaster ride, whisking the audience through broad slapstick, deadpan exchanges and imminent threats that sometimes erupt into mayhem.\u00a0 Brooks gets kidnapped in a home invasion that everybody else assumes is just part of the game, and threatened with murder if the others don't deliver a precious Faberge egg to a scary-voiced mastermind who's giving them orders from afar. The rest of the team splits up into pairs and tries to solve the mystery in their own way, their paths periodically re-crossing, only to diverge again.\u00a0 If you've seen \"The Game\" or other films in which an escapist adventure turns weird and frightening, you'll anticipate some but not all of the twists and turns of \"Game Night,\" and you'll appreciate the way that the screenwriter and directors tie them to the psychology of the characters, and structure the film as a journey of personal as well as narrative discovery. The brothers'\u00a0mutual resentment and\u00a0rivalry is nearly as important here as it was in \"The Game.\" Max and Annie's inability to conceive a child comes into play as well, as do the psychologies and pasts\u00a0of other game night participants. A subplot about Kevin's obsession with figuring out whether Michelle was ever unfaithful to him has a terrific payoff that flips over on itself. There are juicy bits for supporting players as well, including Jeffrey Wright as an FBI agent, Danny Huston as a decadent rotter (his specialty), Michael C. Hall as a scary criminal known as The Bulgarian, and Jesse Plemons as the divorced and seemingly personality-free cop who lives in the same cul-de-sac as Max and Annie and seems obsessed with getting invited to game night again. None of these characters are quite as they appear on first or second\u00a0glance.\u00a0 \"Game Night\" is a nearly perfect entertainment for adults over a certain age. There's a madcap car chase, a violent incident that leads to impromptu surgery, and a house party with echoes of the masked spectacle in \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" but it's all entwined with\u00a0commentary about aging, disappointment, doomed romanticism and sibling rivalry. The\u00a0actors put it all across with flair\u2014especially Bateman and McAdams, who complete each other's thoughts so gracefully that they really do seem as if they've been married forever, and Plemons, who steals every scene he's in through deft underplaying. And while\u00a0there are a few touching moments, the film never tries to claim sentimental or revelatory power it hasn't earned. Advertisement Control of tone is essential in any film that doesn't adhere to a familiar formula, and luckily for the audience, Daley and Goldstein are on top of things. They've got a knack for figuring how far is too far, pushing right up to the border, then stopping with one toe over the line. The understated cartoonishness, anchored in Bateman and McAdams' teamwork, helps a lot. Characters keep sustaining physical injuries that would kill or incapacitate people in reality, only to bounce back and resume the game, but their mishaps are calibrated so that they just seem to smack a bit of sense into them, like an exploding cigar or an anvil on the head in a Bugs Bunny short. This is one of the best surprises of a still-young movie year: a comedy that takes nothing seriously except fun.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cWhat\u2019s the highest grossing Swedish movie of all time?\u201d you\r\nask. Wait, no, you didn\u2019t ask? Well, too bad. The highest grossing Swedish\r\nmovie of all time, apparently, is this one, new to U.S. release, and watching\r\nit, one can see why. The Swedish film industry is one of the oldest and most\r\nadvanced in the world\u2014during the teens and \u201820s of the 20th century,\r\nits output was absolutely on a par with what the greatest innovators of the\r\nU.S. and France were up to\u2014but it is often associated with a kind of dourness,\r\non account (somewhat unfairly) of Ingmar Bergman and his death-occupied allegories.\r\nEven Sweden\u2019s popular culture is pretty dark\u2014it\u2019s from this country that the\r\ndark thrillers of Steig Larsson hail. This movie, as it happens, is a comedy,\r\nbut it\u2019s a frequently grisly one, and one that makes rollicking fun of a lot of\r\ndark Swedish preoccupations.  Advertisement Its plot is very neatly summed up by its title, which was\r\nalso the title of the bestselling novel upon which it is based. The movie\r\nbegins with a dynamite fuse crackling through the opening credits; then, its\r\naged hero, Allan, puts his cat Molotov outside for a bit, and the poor kitty is\r\nkilled by a coyote. Allan takes his revenge by blowing up the offending\r\ncreature. This action lands him in a nursing home, out of whose window he\r\nclimbs on his 100th birthday. The nursing home staff never finds him\r\n(that\u2019s not really a spoiler), but we follow him on his subsequent adventure,\r\nwhich is intercut with his narration and flashbacks of his picaresque 100-year\r\nlife.  \u201cAll I ever want to do is eat, sleep, and blow things up,\u201d\r\nAllan avers at one point. A cruelty inflicted on him in childhood precludes (or\r\nat least inhibits) romance, leaving him with those three easy-to-fulfill\r\ndesires. The blowing-things-up part is part of what gave this story particular\r\nappeal to Swedes. Sweden was, of course, the home of Alfred Nobel, the inventor\r\nof dynamite whose subsequent guilt about it led to the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nSweden\u2019s national character, apparently, is at least partially defined by the\r\nparadox that this peace-loving, ostensibly \u201cprogressive\u201d country is most\r\nnotable in 20th-century world-historical terms for advancing the\r\nscience of explosives. And so we see Allan cavorting through the century,\r\nblissfully free of ideology or perspective\u2014a more well-spoken, self-aware Forrest Gump, if you please\u2014encountering the likes of Franco and Oppenheimer\r\nand Stalin, and just happy to make things go boom the whole while. In the\r\npresent day, he stumbles upon a suitcase full of cash, makes an accomplice of a\r\nrascally railway station agent, helps rescue a circus elephant, and more, all\r\nwhile thoroughly flummoxing a motorcycle gang who want the cash and the\r\nextremely understaffed and indolent police force that\u2019s pursuing him. That last\r\nelement is a bit of a subtle counter to the depiction of Swedish cops in the\r\naforementioned Steig Larsson books.  Still you don\u2019t have to be Swedish to enjoy the film. The\r\npicaresque mode is one that\u2019s well-liked throughout Western culture, and this\r\nmovie, directed by Felix Herngren and starring popular Swedish comedian Robert\r\nGustaffson, executes it reasonably well, with touches not just reminiscent of\r\n\u201cGump\u201d but of \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d and other popular tall tales of our\r\ntime. It is ever so slightly more cynical and in-your-face with mordant humor\r\nthan a mainstream American film would have been; the insouciant treatment of\r\nAllan\u2019s first experiment with dynamite is more Adam Rifkin than Robert\r\nZemeckis. Such slight tonal eccentricities didn\u2019t quite do the trick for this\r\nreviewer, however.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Borgman", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In the same black, poisoned vein as \"Dogtooth\" and \"Funny Games\" pumps Alex van Warmerdam\u2019s \"Borgman,\" another darkly comic thriller about domesticity crumbling into violence and even insanity. Like a religious parable designed to present more questions than answers, \"Borgman\" can sometimes frustrate but it is an accomplished piece of work, driven by a uniquely malevolent tonal balance and two fantastic central performances. It sometimes simmers when I wish it would boil over but damn if it isn\u2019t fascinating to watch the water bubble. Advertisement \"And they descended upon the Earth to strengthen their ranks.\" After that unsettling biblical quote, van Warmerdam opens with a series of equally unsettling images as an old-fashioned hunting party heads into a wooded area with spears, a barking dog and a shotgun. I should mention that the gentleman carrying the firearm is a priest. They\u2019re clearly after something evil and that something lives underground. Having crafted himself a home under the Earth (or perhaps born there as some sort of demon), lives Camiel Borgman (the fantastic Jan Bijvoet). He escapes the hunting party and alerts two fellow earth dwellers\u2014Richard (Jeroen Perceval) and Ludwig (the director himself)\u2014that they must move on as well. Is Borgman just a homeless man? Why were people trying to kill him? Why does he live underground? What is he planning next? What ranks? Did he \"descend upon the Earth\"? \"Borgman\" is one of those films in which questions pile up much more quickly than resolutions, which leads to a growing sense of unease that only strengthens as Borgman and his mates enter suburbia and bodies begin to pile up. Borgman knocks on the door of Richard (Jeroen Perceval) and Marina (Hadewych Minis), the heads of a seemingly normal family, complete with children and a regular nanny (Sara Hjort Ditlevsen). All Borgman asks for is a bath. Can a well-spoken, seemingly harmless homeless man get clean? When Richard balks, Borgman claims to know Marina. She denies it but the first crack is already in place in this relationship before he\u2019s even in the house. Richard confronts the tramp on his front step, beating him brutally. When Marina later finds Borgman hiding in the garage, she takes pity on him, in no small part because he\u2019s been injured by her husband. She lets him stay in hiding in the house. And Borgman knows how to hide, often having to say \"I\u2019m here\" because no one actually hears him come in. He borders on supernatural in the way he smoothly slides in and out of the family home, and he begins to influence Richard, Marina, and their children. \"Influence\" is one word for it. Where \"Borgman\" goes from here, I won\u2019t spoil, but it takes a turn from what you might presume is a simple domestic thriller to something much stranger when Borgman\u2019s crew gets heavily involved in what one could only describe as the takeover of an upper-class family. Van Warmerdam is clearly commenting on class issues, countering Borgman\u2019s tramp status with the wealth on display in the world that he increasingly manipulates. However, the social commentary of \"Borgman\" feels like background more than thematic centerpiece. Van Warmerdam is way more interested in mood, malevolence, and the general sense of unease that permeates every frame of \"Borgman.\" To start asking too many questions about Borgman\u2019s background and purpose is to lose focus on the more tonal joys to be held here. There is malice, darkness, and true evil potentially hiding not just within every knock at the door but at the family dinner table. It only takes a catalyst to reveal it. At almost two hours, some of \"Borgman\" feels a bit too cinematically deliberate\u2014purposefully opaque without meaning at all, even tonally. There were times when I wanted to \"get on with it\" and I'm not sure the destination satisfies as much as the journey. However, frustrations are few and far between, thanks in large part to the riveting work by Bijvoet and Minis as the drifter and the woman he claimed to know when all he needed was a place to take a bath. Or did he? Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Silence", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Silence\" is a monumental work, and a punishing one. It puts you through hell with no promise of enlightenment, only a set of questions and propositions, sensations and experiences. It is no surprise to learn that the film's director, Martin Scorsese, has been working on it for decades, since he first read the 1966\u00a0source novel\u00a0by Sh\u00fbsaku End\u00f4 about Jesuit priests suffering for their faith in 17th century Japan, where Christianity is outlawed. I can't think of another Scorsese film that's so intent on simply showing us things and letting us consider their meaning. There's a little bit of voiceover narration and a few shots that go inside characters' perceptions, but for the most part you're an observer, watching people from a purposeful distance. The film starts with a long moment of actual silence, and embraces silence throughout its running time, or something akin to silence. Wood burning, waves crashing, wind moving through grass: this is what you often hear in place of a musical score. When \"Silence\" is not quiet, you wish that it were, because the soundtrack is filled with moans of pain and screams of agony and the sounds of bones being broken and flame searing flesh. And, of course, during such moments you fear silence, too, because the grave is silent. Advertisement The story is simple: two priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) leave Portugal for Japan to find a third priest (Liam Neeson) who has gone missing while working as a missionary. The third priest is believed to have committed apostasy by stepping on an image of Jesus Christ after being tormented by the Japanese. Eventually, one of these wandering priests\u2014Garfield's character,\u00a0Father Sebasti\u00e3o Rodrigues\u2014gets captured and goes through a similar experience, surviving torture and witnessing the torture of others while pondering unanswerable questions: How much suffering can a man take before breaking and renouncing that which is most important to him? If he does break, does it mean he has failed God? Does God want him to resist blasphemy no matter what the cost? Or does he want the priest to give up and renounce his faith, secure in the knowledge that God's love is great enough to forgive him for not being able to endure unendurable pain? Is God indifferent to the suffering? Does He even notice it? The movie starts with the first priest,\u00a0Father Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Ferreira (Neeson), witnessing mass torture of Christians and being told that if he will only commit apostasy, the suffering will cease. The story then jumps forward many years to find Father Rodrigues and his partner,\u00a0Father Francisco Garrpe (Adam Driver), as they make their way to Japan by way of Macao (with help from a Japanese Christian whose own faith seems reawakened by serving as their guide). The first hour of the film is a somewhat picaresque narrative that slowly builds dread as the priests get closer to figuring out what happened their predecessor. The Japanese authorities don't take kindly to Europeans wandering around their island nation talking about the glories of Jesus. In fact, they see Christianity as a cancer to be cut from the body politic. In the film's second half, Father Rodrigues finds himself locked in a wooden cage and forced to watch and hear the torture of Japanese Christians\u2014some of whom followed and helped him. He is plagued by doubts, not just about the wisdom of coming to Japan or his capacity to survive this ordeal, but the wisdom of the missionary enterprise, which expects people to suffer and die on behalf of ideals. The priest even begins to wonder what God wants, what He's thinking, and whether He has a point-of-view on misery and pain. Advertisement What would Jesus do? A lot of people in Father Rodrigues' position would interpret that as a physical challenge:\u00a0if Christ withstood the agonies of the cross, I can get through this.\u00a0But Christ wasn't mortal, so it's an unfair test. But what if the unfairness of the test is the test? And what of the other prisoners in the facility with the priest? All it would take to end their suffering\u2014or so the priest is told\u2014is one footprint on the image of the savior. Is it moral to allow others to suffer when their suffering can be ended with a single symbolic gesture? Would God want that? Maybe the priest is destined to realize that it\u2019s all right to apostatize if it ends the pain of others.\u00a0 Scorsese and his co-screenwriter Jay Cocks\u2014the two did uncredited rewrites on \"The Last Temptation of Christ\"\u2014have been accused by some of my colleagues of glorifying the European missionaries, or at least not examining them in a critical enough way. I didn\u2019t get this out of \u201cSilence\u201d at all. In fact, one of the things that impressed me most about it was the care it devotes to understanding the position of the Japanese authorities. Without condoning their brutality, it lets a major character\u2014Inoue Masashige (Issei Ogata), one of the officials in charge of eradicating Christianity from Japan, and the supervisor of the hero\u2019s suffering\u2014explain the official point-of-view on Western religion. He doesn\u2019t just consider it a corrupting influence on Japanese culture, he doubts that Christianity can truly take root in the \u201cswamp\u201d (his word) of his home country. There are echoes here of another recurring Scorsese fascination, the self-preservation instinct of the tribe. The tribe may tolerate rebellion, heresy or external threats up to a point, but after that they crack down mercilessly.\u00a0 Scorsese's respectful distance makes the suffering more unbearable than it would be if he showed every atrocity in close-up. It's unsettling because it conflates the point-of-view of God and the point-of-view of the audience. You're paralyzed. You want to act, or you want the movie to act, to stop the suffering, but the suffering continues until finally it doesn't. We're watching men of God being tested. Try as they might, they cannot entirely wrap their minds around the purpose of the test, and when they do grapple with it, they worry that they've arrived at the wrong conclusion. They worry that they\u2019ve missed the point; that they're not faithful enough or smart enough to understand why this horror exists, or must exist.\u00a0I don\u2019t know what to think of the ending of the film, which I won\u2019t discuss here except to say that I\u2019ve changed my mind about it many times, and that it seems to be constructed to encourage viewers to come at it again from new angles rather than settling on a single conclusion.\u00a0This is not the sort of film you \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdon't like.\u201d It's a film that you experience and then live with.\u00a0 Advertisement Scorsese has been here before, in one sense or another\u2014not just in straightforwardly theological dramas such as \"Kundun\" and \"The Last Temptation of Christ,\" but in his crime pictures and thrillers as well. The entire running time of \"Silence\" could be the self-flagellating fantasy of the young hoodlum hero of Scorsese's 1973 breakthrough \"Mean Streets\" as he holds his hand over a flame (the title character in \"Taxi Driver\" did the same thing), and the terrors visited upon the priests and their flock are sadistic enough to have come straight from the reptile brain of Max Cady in \"Cape Fear,\" a devil or demon figure who exists to punish people for the sins of weakness, hypocrisy and pride. But \"Silence\" foregrounds such things in the manner of a parable that is not intended to lead the listener to a single realization but to stimulate thought and emotion. This, too, is characteristic of Scorsese, who studied to be a priest but became a monk for cinema, and who nonchalantly describes himself as a \"lapsed Catholic\" yet has been preoccupied with sin and salvation for nearly 50 years and weaves Christian themes, imagery and situations throughout his work. You even find them in what might otherwise be straightforward commercial genre projects\u2014\"Cape Fear,\" \"The Departed\" and \"The Color of Money\" spring to mind\u2014in which Scorsese seems to be using theology to frame his story and characters in ways that he understands, maybe as a way of personalizing a story that's not all that personal otherwise. For a lapsed Catholic he sure does see the entire world in terms of imponderables and spiritual tests. Maybe there\u2019s an alternate reality in which Scorsese became a priest. I bet he was a good one.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "For \u201cThe Kingdom of Dreams and Madness,\u201d director Mami\r\nSunada was allowed remarkable access to one of the most important artistic\r\nenterprises of the last half-century, Studio Ghibli, at a unique point in\r\nits existence. News about the shuttering of the company that has given the\r\nworld masterpieces like \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d and \u201cSpirited Away\u201d reverberated\r\nthroughout the animation community and beyond earlier this year. And there\u2019s a\r\nsense in \u201cKingdom\" that this is an elegy of sorts, a goodbye to an era of\r\nremarkable creative resonance. The cinematic visions that emerged from the\r\ndrawing tables of this relatively nondescript building have influenced\r\ncountless creative voices, and will continue to do so for the rest of time. To\r\nsay I\u2019m a Ghibli fan would be something of an understatement (my \u201cTotoro\u201d\r\niPhone case had to be internationally ordered, for the record), and so \u201cKingdom\u201d\r\nnaturally speaks to my interests. If you\u2019re not enraptured with the work of\r\nHayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and the rest of the artists at Ghibli, it may not\r\nbe precisely what you\u2019re looking for, but Sanada captures something poetic\r\nabout art and creativity that could speak to anyone, animation fan or\r\notherwise. Advertisement Having said that, it\u2019s very helpful to have seen \u201cThe Wind\r\nRises\u201d and \u201cThe Tale of the Princess Kaguya,\u201d the two most recent Ghibli films,\r\nand the two pieces being worked on for the year Sanada had access to the\r\nstudio. Just the very idea that two such massive productions from two masters\r\nof the form were being produced simultaneously seems to cause ulcers in several\r\nproducers involved. And yet Miyazaki\u2019s process has been the same for decades.\r\nHe works from 11am-9pm every day, on the dot. He doesn\u2019t write scripts, he\r\nwrites storyboards, and his assistants begin production from those drawings\r\nbefore he\u2019s done, unsure of how the film will end. Miyazaki is very open with\r\nhis process, opening his studio and home to Sanada, and philosophizing on art\r\nand humanity in ways that feel like someone coming to terms with a life\u2019s work.\r\nHe speaks candidly about how he makes films for others, most notably the people\r\nat Ghibli, and yet there\u2019s something so deeply personal about \u201cThe Wind Rises\u201d\r\nthat it\u2019s the first film that makes him cry after its premiere screening. He\r\nshares the \u201cbeautiful but cursed dreams\u201d of its protagonist. \u201cThe Kingdom of Dreams and Madness\u201d contains surprisingly\r\nlittle actual film footage. There are more shots of Miyazaki's cat than his films. We see bits and pieces of \u201cWind Rises\u201d as it\u2019s\r\nbeing assembled, but this is more a \u201cyear in the life\u201d documentary than a\r\nhistory of the studio, although there are bits and pieces of the latter. Sanada\u2019s\r\nfilm is at its best when the director conveys the realization that this is a\r\nstudio and creative voice at the very least in a transitional period and\r\narguably in its twilight phase. The music, the tone, the subject matter of the\r\ntwo films, Miyazaki\u2019s candid self-reflection\u2014it all combines to paint a\r\nportrait of something beautiful that\u2019s coming to an end. At nearly two hours,\r\nSanada hits a few of these beats a bit too many times, even for this fan, and\r\nthe film bizarrely feels like it\u2019s ending around the 90-minute mark, complete\r\nwith a production-finishing montage, only to go on for another half-hour. It\u2019s\r\na fascinating look into a creative process that has been essential to the\r\nhistory of animation, but it could have been tighter as a documentary. There\u2019s an amazing passage in which Miyazaki receives a letter\r\nfrom a man who received assistance from Miyazaki\u2019s father after the war. The\r\nproduction of \u201cThe Wind Rises\u201d inspired the man to write Miyazaki, and the\r\ndirector points out how the event \u201cProbably shaped the way this man looked at\r\nthe world.\u201d Reality influenced art which then reflected back on reality. The\r\ntruth is that Miyazaki and the people at Studio Ghibli have been shaping the\r\nway we look at the world for years, and will continue to do so long after the\r\nKingdom has closed.

{"Title": "Much Ado About Nothing", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Within the first 10 minutes of Joss Whedon's \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" I found myself smiling with excitement, while also holding my breath in nervous anxiety. Would the film be able to sustain its confident manic tone, maintain its humor and smarts, its depth of characterization and innovative use of text and landscape? Would the magic hold? The magic holds. It holds from beginning to end. Audiences will remember Kenneth Branagh's well-received version from 1993, with the cast of stars tumbling and laughing over bright hillsides in Tuscany, dressed in flowing period garb. Whedon takes a different approach. It's done in modern dress. There are no big stars in it, although fans of Whedon's films and television series will recognize many of his regulars. He shot in glamorous black-and-white (Jay Hunter was the cinematographer), which may seem like a serious choice for such comedic material until you remember that some of the funniest comedies ever made were filmed in black-and-white. Whedon firmly places \"Much Ado About Nothing\" in the screwball tradition where it belongs. He uses one main location (his own house), and much of it takes place in echoing high-end interiors, perfect for a story where everyone is constantly eavesdropping on everyone else. The acoustics in the house are very poor for anyone who wants to keep a secret. The adaptation, done by Whedon, is terrific. The play moves from comedy to tragedy and back with dizzying speed, and while you may feel like you're getting whiplash, that's the desired effect. Advertisement Whedon, beloved by television audiences for his cult favorites \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Firefly\" (to mention just a few), is known for creating independent and memorable female characters, and in this, Shakespeare is a perfect fit for him as a director. Shakespeare created Rosalind in \"As You Like It,\" Katherine in \"Taming of the Shrew,\" Lady Macbeth in \"Macbeth,\" Cleopatra in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and a host of iconic others.  Misogyny is alive and well in Shakespeare and takes on a particularly vicious aspect in \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" when a woman's virginity is prized above her humanity, but Shakespeare, as usual, has his cake and eats it too. \"Much Ado\" strolls into some pretty dark forests, morally and spiritually, and while I'm not sure that Hero, the betrayed heroine, would agree with the title that it all had been \"much ado about nothing,\" the crookedness of the universe is righted gloriously in the end. The intrigues of Italian war and political life are merely backdrop in Shakespeare's comedy and it's backdrop here, too. The opening shows Don Pedro and Claudio (Reed Diamond and Fran Kranz, both excellent) returning from abroad, complete with security detail and a motorcade of gleaming cars. They bring with them Benedick (the marvelous Alexis Denisof), Don John (Sean Maher, who looks like Robert Chambers, the Preppy Murderer, a perfect choice considering Don John's malevolent character), and Don John's cunning sidekick Conrade (played, in Whedon's version, by a woman, Riki Lindhome). They stop off at the beautiful home of Leonato (Clark Gregg), to celebrate with relatives and friends, all of whom have nothing else to do besides hang out in the house, drink wine, gossip, and make mischief with one another's love lives. Claudio confesses to Don Pedro that he has fallen in instant-love with Leonato's beautiful young daughter Hero (Jillian Morgese). Don Pedro immediately begins scheming on a way to bring the romance to fruition. A masked ball thrown that night gives him the opportunity he is looking for. Hero's cousin Beatrice (played by Amy Acker) tells anyone who will listen (and even those who tune her out) that love is not for her, and marriage is for the birds. She especially wants everyone to know that Benedick is a jerk, and he doesn't matter to her at all! Benedick returns her insults, to her face and behind her back. Of course if the two were as indifferent towards one another as they declared, then why do they keep talking incessantly about each other? Hero and her maids, along with the menfolk in the house, conspire to bring the arguing two together. Advertisement All of this love-making could have gone forward without a hitch if Don John had not been in the house. Don John is disturbed by other people's happiness. He is the evil version of the melancholy Jaques in \"As You Like It\". He has no purpose beyond making trouble for others. He figures out a way to make it seem as if Hero had been unfaithful to Claudio, on the night before the two were to be wed. Claudio reacts ferociously. Hero faints. Leonato screams that his daughter has besmirched his family name. Don John smiles happily. Beatrice and Benedick find themselves unlikely allies in untangling the web of intrigue and malice. Doug Moston, acting teacher and Shakespeare scholar, had this to say to his classes about Shakespeare's language: \"If you think a line is bawdy, it\u2019s bawdy. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s bawdy \u2014 it\u2019s only because you haven\u2019t worked it out yet.\" Joss Whedon and his capable cast have \"worked it out.\" Every line shimmers with double entendre. Sex roils underneath every moment, every motivation, every misunderstanding and every rejoinder. Even the scene between Don John and Conrade, where Don John discusses how disturbed he is by joy, becomes a scene of hot foreplay between the two, where lines like, \"If I had my mouth I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking\" take on new worlds of meaning. Dogberry, a policeman in charge of security at Leonato's house, enters the scene late in the game, having stumbled across the plot against Hero, and once he arrives you never want him to leave. Dogberry tries to sound smart and official, all while saying things like, \"You shall comprehend all vagrom men,\" when he clearly means \"apprehend\" and \"vagrant,\" or dispatching his security guards with the order, \"Be vigitant, I beseech you.\" He is ridiculous, saying these mispronounced words with total confidence. He covers up his incompetence and lack of vocabulary with a bluff swaggering persona, complete with dark sunglasses, and Nathan Fillion, from \"Firefly\" and \"Serenity,\" gives a great and entertaining comedic performance. Advertisement Beatrice and Benedick steal the show, though, in this version and in every version I've seen, on film or on stage. Nobody has informed the two of them that they are not the leads, that their romance is the subplot. Their barbs are sometimes vicious, and both characters show a studied indifference towards marriage and love. Beatrice and Benedick are the patron saints of 1930s screwball comedy. Sam and Diane from \"Cheers\" carried on their tradition. Any rom-com we see today is haunted by the arguing defensive love-mad ghosts of Beatrice and Benedick. The two are so equally matched, so dazzlingly verbal, so witty, so \"self-endeared\" (as Hero calls Beatrice), and totally obsessed with each other that, frankly, who else could put up with either of them? It's no surprise that when Hector Berlioz turned \"Much Ado About Nothing\" into an opera in 1862, he called it \"B\u00e9atrice et B\u00e9n\u00e9dict\". Claudio and Hero are the ostensible leads of \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" but Beatrice and Benedick are the ones that everyone remembers. Watching Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof battle it out, in words and in a near wrestling match near the end of the film, is a supreme pleasure. Beatrice is a tough-talkin' dame like Carole Lombard or Katharine Hepburn, and Benedick is an independent irritable guy, reminiscent of Cary Grant or William Powell. Underneath the hostility is a coursing current of love and desire, lust and fondness, which both characters struggle mightily to hide. When they finally crack, when they finally give in, it is breath-taking and emotional. \"Much Ado About Nothing\" is one of the best films of the year.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Central Intelligence", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "There's a kitchen fight in \"Central Intelligence\" pitting a man with a butcher knife against a man with a banana. The man with the banana wins. I love scenes like this, where the movie seems to be saying, \"This is the kind of movie I am\u2014the kind where you can kill a man with a banana. Enjoy.\" And you do.  The film is a buddy action comedy in the vein of \"The In-Laws\" and \"Midnight Run,\" with a splash of 1930s movie slapstick. Kevin Hart plays Calvin Joyner, a deadpan worrywart who was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" in high school. He has a good job and a charming wife but still feels like a failure. Dwayne Johnson plays his old high school classmate, Robert Weirdicht, aka Bob Stone, a bullied fat kid who grew up to become a muscular CIA agent but still wears a fanny pack and can't stop talking about \"Sixteen Candles.\" Bob is six-foot-four and built like an action figure, which comes in handy in scenes that require him to do battle with a nunchacku-wielding assassin on a motorbike, or pirouette through a battle zone tossing tiny explosives from his fanny pack like Bugs Bunny as Br\u00fcnnhilde strewing flower petals in her wake.  Advertisement Bob says he just wants to hang out with Calvin, the only guy in high school who was ever nice to him, on the eve of their 20th high school reunion. He's secretly a renegade agent accused of killing his partner and committing treason, and he needs Calvin's accounting expertise to thwart a terrorist plot and clear his name. But his adoration of Calvin is sincere. He loves Calvin the way little kids love superheroes. Worships him. Adores him. He tells Calvin he needs his help and asks if he's out or in. Calvin says he's not in. Bob says he's in, that he was always in. Calvin wants to know why Bob asked him if he was in or out if he was always in regardless. Bob says it's because he wanted to feel the pride and excitement of hearing Calvin tell him he's in. \"I'm not in,\" Calvin says. He says this again and again, all through the movie: \"I'm not in.\" He screams it while Bob is pushing him in a mail cart through a hail of gunfire and telling him to relax, everything's gonna be fine. This is their relationship.  And the best thing about this movie is that you believe in the relationship. Hart and Johnson are a classic comedy duo in the tradition of Abbott & Costello, Bob Hope & Bing Crosby and Gene Wilder & Richard Pryor. And they certainly have the silhouettes for it: when the two stand side-by-side, their height difference is so great that they become iconic: the genie and the man who summoned him.  But the film also takes them seriously as characters with dashed hopes and unrealized aspirations, men who feel things deeply even though they might not show it. They bicker, they yell at each other, and they get drawn into circuitous conversations about subjects that have little to do with the mission.\u00a0 Hart is playing a mid-period Matthew Broderick character: an emotionally constipated Everyman who sounds like he's trying to be\r\n polite even when he's hollering about some cockamamie plan\r\n that Bob has roped him into. When a \r\nburly CIA agent hands him an iPad that was supposed to show images that \r\nwould frighten and horrify him, he stares at the iPad for just exactly \r\nthe right length of time before saying, \"That's PornHub.\"\u00a0   Bob is Calvin's id, lying to him and manipulating him to draw him into dangerous situations, but he's also his voice of conscience, urging him to act like the shining example of bravery and kindness that Bob always knew him to be. Johnson, who's become a fearless comic actor as well as a great action star, does the best work of his career as Bob. Calvin calls him \"Jason Bourne in jorts,\" but despite the fact that Bob can kill a man with anything, even a banana, and has a mysteriously chilly (and chill) quality that makes Calvin wonder if those awful stories about him are true, he's a sweetie-pie\u2014a Great Dane puppy bounding through the movie. Nobody in Hollywood has Johnson's aura of decency\u2014he should have played Superman\u2014and it's used ingeniously here, to allow us to like and even root for a man who is as innocently selfish as a child, a one-man wrecking crew demanding Calvin's full attention. \"I'll never be like Molly Ringwald,\" Bob laments. He means it. And it's tearing him up inside. Advertisement Each man embodies the other's unfulfilled fantasies of \"real\" success; Bob is the bad-ass knight in shining armor that Calvin was told he was destined to become. Bob aspires to have a relationship as stable and nurturing as the one Calvin has with his onetime high school girlfriend-turned-wife, Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). Calvin thinks he's a little man, in every sense\u2014a man of no importance\u2014but Bob Stone would not exist without him. And yet Bob is still a scared kid inside, a truth conveyed in expressionistic scenes of humiliation that replay in reflected surfaces and even behind Bob's head (like a movie that Bob has literally turned his back on because he can't bear to watch).\u00a0 Bob Stone is a magnificent comic creation, a man who exhorts his friend to be the hero of his own story because it worked for Bob, and who never stops searching the text of his world for bits of foreshadowing, for signs and symbols. But he wouldn't have the same impact if Calvin weren't there beside him, babbling in apprehension and improvising whopping lies while big men threaten to kill him. The two complete each other in an ungainly yet perfect way, like the centaurs that serve as the duo's high school mascot.  \"Central Intelligence\" is written by Ike Barinholtz, David Stassen and Rawson Marshall Thurber, and directed by Thurber, who also did \"We're the Millers\" and \"Dodgeball,\" two of the better recent examples of the smart dumb comedy. It may not be a deep and complex masterpiece that will spawn symposiums and appreciations, but it is a classic of a very particular sort. It's the kind of movie that you watch on TV when you're supposed to be doing more important things, or experiencing more important movies, even though you've already seen it ten times, because it's still funny, and because you believe in the big man and the small man that he looks up to.

{"Title": "The Young Karl Marx", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Raoul Peck is on a roll. The Haitian director raised some consciousness with last year\u2019s James-Baldwin-speaks-to-today-in-his-own-words documentary \u201cI Am Not Your Negro.\u201d And now there\u2019s this, a bold, some might say dialectical exercise. That is, an account of the title character\u2019s life and thought in the packaging of a conventional and possibly sentimental biopic. The movie begins with a text account of the industrial revolution\u2019s creation of a working class called \u201cthe proletariat\u201d in Marxist thought. Then, in 1843 German, a Marxist parable, in which poor folk are slaughtered for the crime of collecting deadwood in a forest. 25-year-old Marx writes incendiary articles for the Rhineland News, and upon arrest, agrees to follow a wealthy patron, Arnold Ruge, to Paris to work on his post-Hegelian philosophy and stuff. The action moves to Manchester, England, and a sewing-thread factory owned by Friedrich Engels, Sr. Junior, his wide-eyed son, has no use for his father\u2019s autocratic mien and mistreatment of workers, and one of the movie\u2019s most audacious scenes in staging the meeting of young Engels and his future partner Mary Burns, a working class woman with then-radical ideas, as a kind of meet-cute on the father\u2019s factory floor in the middle of a walkout.    Advertisement In Paris, Marx struggles, unpaid by Ruge, unable to provide for his wife Jenny and their daughter. Jenny is played by Vicky Krieps, of newly minted \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d fame. She is a very vivid presence from her entrance on\u2014the filmmakers could have cashed in by re-titling the U.S. release \u201cThe Hungry Karl Marx.\u201d Marx meets the visiting Engels in Ruge\u2019s drawing room, and after sniffing around each other\u2014Karl instinctively distrusts the born-into-wealth Friedrich\u2014express admiration for each other\u2019s work. They head to the streets, run from French monarchist police who are busting heads of foreigners and agitators, and get wildly drunk, on both exchanged ideas and spirits. Then it\u2019s The Hungover Karl Marx.    The movie chronicles their friendship, collaboration, and the tough time they had persuading more idealistic and less proactive workers\u2019 representatives that a coherent doctrine was necessary for any meaningful movement to form and thrive. Marx in particular spars, politely, with French anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudon. Marx\u2019s response to the elder statesman\u2019s famed pronouncement \u201cProperty is theft\u201d is an inquiry: \u201cWhose property?\u201d    The movie does not put ideas at the forefront, but it does present ideas with a solidity that\u2019s admirable. Peck\u2019s co-screenwriters Pascal Bonitzer, a longtime collaborator of the late Jacques Rivette, and the two clearly know their stuff. The movie is largely a story of personalities. Karl is fiery, brilliant, disorganized, passionate. Engels is, despite his courage and curiosity, a bit more of a wide-eyed innocent and certainly a more organized person. Their female partners do take secondary roles, but the movie depicts them as committed, innovative, and acute: true fellow travelers and comrades. The actors portraying these figures are all exciting to watch. August Diehl (who played a German major in \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d) is a fiery, sardonic, likable Marx. Stefan Konarske is a sincere, appealing Engels. Krieps\u2019 Jenny has more than a touch of slyness while Hannah Steele\u2019s Mary is appropriately fiery and proud. French great Olivier Gourmet is droll as Proudhon.    Marx and Engels\u2019 thought was genuinely revolutionary, and it\u2019s clear that Peck and Bonitzer would insist that said thought had little if anything to do with the depredations of the supposedly Marx-inspired Soviet Union. A post-diegetic text refers to Marx\u2019s \u201cKapital,\u201d noting that the work was unfinished, in part because Capital itself is ever evolving. An end credits sequence, a montage scored to a well-known '60s rock tune, attempts a precis of the evolution in very short form. It\u2019s not unpersuasive.\u00a0  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}

{"Title": "Results", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Writer/director Andrew Bujalski's latest film, \"Results,\" is his first to feature established actors (Guy Pearce, Cobie Smulders, Kevin Corrigan), and it is his version of a rom-com. What that means is that romance is a series of messy encounters and bizarre interludes, with buried motivations running the show. Human emotions are a mystery to these characters. They don't know how to speak the language of the heart, which (coincidentally) makes them seem more \"real\" than most characters in movies. In conventional rom-coms, when a character makes a heartfelt speech, it is articulate and cathartic. In \"Results,\" the characters (most of whom are physical trainers) fall back on fitness metaphors, and even as they do so they know that they aren't quite getting to the heart of the matter. Words help you access your emotions and these characters, for the most part, don't have the words. It's a very Bujalski-esque quality, awkward, prickly, irritable. \"Results\" doesn't have the inventiveness of \"Computer Chess\" (2013), and in some cases Bujalski feels out of his depth in \"Results,\" but perhaps that is just where he needs to be. \"Results\" is not entirely successful (the two main plots don't quite fit together) but it does have a charm and a style that works. In its own weird way, it is quite romantic, while acknowledging that romance is sometimes unpleasant, always messy, and hooking up with someone represents the beginning of a lifetime of getting into messes and digging oneself out. That quality alone makes \"Results\" a really refreshing film.\u00a0 Advertisement Taking place in Austin, Texas, \"Results\" introduces us to a close-knit, argumentative group of personal trainers, who all work at Power 4 Life, a gym created by the ambitious and helplessly inarticulate Trevor (Guy Pearce). Trevor has big plans: He wants to be a guru. He wants to create an entire \"philosophy\" for fitness and wellness, although he can't really articulate what that philosophy is. He wants to expand his gym to include juice bars and psychiatrists on call. The personal trainers who work for him are at each other's throats in competition for clients. When we first meet Kat (Cobie Smulders), she's on her daily run, and she chases down a car she recognizes to demand that the driver settle up late payments. Kat is ferocious and judgmental. Terrifying, really. She's also been sleeping with Trevor, her boss. They both know it's inappropriate, but they can't help it.\u00a0 Into this cloistered world of extraordinarily fit and driven people strolls the schlubby, sweaty Danny (Kevin Corrigan, in a hilarious performance). Danny is a transplant from New York, recently wealthy, holed up in an empty McMansion, playing his electric guitar in echoing rooms. For unknown reasons, he walks into Power 4 Life to sign up for training. Trevor, acting all shiny and inspirational in that desperate way that characterizes the anxious salesman, asks Danny what he's looking for and Danny, who does not know the lingo of wellness, says that he wants to know how to take a punch and not fall down. Trevor asks, \"Have you spent much time in gyms?\" Danny laughs scornfully, saying, \"Fuck no.\" Behind Trevor's desk is a poster declaring \"NO FEAR EXCUSES SURRENDER,\" but Trevor's head blocks Danny's view, and Danny expresses confusion why the poster says \"FEAR EXCUSES SURRENDER.\" This small comedic \"bit\" encapsulates the gap of understanding between the two men. They both speak English, but they can barely understand one another. Kat is assigned to train Danny.\u00a0 Kat's training sessions with Danny have a similar gap of understanding. Danny does what Kat tells him to do, but her inspirational language doesn't make a dent. It's all empty to him. He starts to obsess on her, watching Youtube videos of her workouts. It's creepy, but in a benign way. Besides, she's drawn to him too. What's Danny's deal? In the middle of the night he puts out messages on a local message board: \"I will give you $200 if you set up my television.\" Someone shows up to do that. \"I will give you $200 if you give me a cat.\" A cat shows up at the door. Danny's journey is so bizarre (is he malevolent? is he just lonely?) that it creates its own force field of energy, and when the film moves away from him to detail the relationship between Kat and Trevor, the film loses some of its charge. Danny disappears from the film for a long period of time, and the film tips over without that counter-weight.\u00a0 Advertisement There are a couple of hilarious set-pieces, beautifully filmed and performed, the main one being the chaotic dinner Kat and Trevor have with a Russian body-builder (Trevor's idol) and his submissive wife. Trevor cannot seem to stop speaking in halting homilies of inspiration, and yet he also turns into a cringing sycophant in the presence of his idol, bowing and scraping before the Great Man. The unsmiling Russian shoots down everything Trevor says in an unimpressed deadpan. The wife can barely sit down because she is so busy re-filling everyone's glasses and being a good hostess. Kat and Trevor fight with one another, using the Russian and the wife as sounding-boards. They are the worst guests ever. It's a totally screwball sequence. Bujalski's script is top-notch.\u00a0 These people, Kat and Trevor, don't know how to feel things. Or, they feel things but then resent the feelings, and go for a run to shake it off. The bond they share starts to make demands, emotional demands, and neither one handles it well or gracefully. This makes them very human. It's strangely touching, to see these two control-freak people submit to the conventions of a rom-com, spouting fitness metaphors the whole way. Love is not neat. It's a mess and \"Results\" does not try to clean up the mess.\u00a0 Guy Pearce is very funny in the role of Trevor, a good person who really cares about fitness: he's trying to create a \"brand,\" but he doesn't really understand what that means. He is not a good businessman. When he is asked to explain himself, he flounders, but all with an eager \"just hear me out\" energy that ends up being charming and almost pathetic. Cobie Smulders, so intimidating in her first appearance in the film, manages to suggest that Kat is in a bit of an existential crisis. She's almost 30. Does she have any plans? Is she good at anything else? And Kevin Corrigan, sweaty and clueless, creepy and benign, brings depth and humor to every line that comes from his mouth. He's the outsider in the main world of the film, but he becomes its compelling center.\u00a0 Advertisement Bujalski has carved out a very interesting place for himself in the world of independent film, starting with \"Funny Ha Ha\" (2002), a low-budget (putting it mildly) film about post-graduates meandering aimlessly through their lives in New York, talking endlessly, kissing each other, getting into messes, and then floundering around in the mess. \"Mutual Appreciation\" (2005) continued that trajectory, only this time in black-and-white. Most of mumblecore films were shot digitally and featured lots of improvisation, while Bujalski shot his on film and wrote detailed scripts. He is interested in the various forms that make up mainstream film and brings his own unique viewpoint to these well-established forms. \"Computer Chess\", from 2013, was an experiment in form (Many didn't care for it; I loved it.) Shot on an old Sony AVC-3260 camera and in 4:3 aspect ratio, \"Computer Chess\" looks like it actually was made in the year it takes place, 1984, and it tells the story of a group of software programmers competing in a computer chess tournament. \"Computer Chess\" was compelling visually, and extremely out there in some of its plot-points (the cats!), but it was hypnotic, entertaining and intelligent.\u00a0 \"Results\" is less focused than \"Computer Chess,\" but in a way that serves its particular story. It is interested in the emotions of people who are not accustomed to feeling emotions (besides irritation). When the characters clamp down on their softness, on their natural affinity for one another, they cause chaos in their own lives. The whole movie is chaos. And that's a good thing.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "A Coffee in Berlin", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "There's a sharp commentary at the heart of writer-director Jan Ole Gerster's debut feature, \"A Coffee in Berlin\" (originally titled \"Oh Boy\"), which swept up many of the major German film awards last year. It tells the story of Niko (Tom Schilling), a twentysomething guy who has dropped out of law school, failed to inform his father of that fact, and yet still accepts the father's funding for the schooling that no longer exists. \"A Coffee in Berlin\" has some funny things to say about the \"younger generation\" and its prolonged adolescence, its putting-off of dealing with serious matters. With themes reminiscent of \"Frances Ha,\" down to its being filmed in black-and-white, \"A Coffee in Berlin\" presents a day or so in the life of Niko, as he careens from one absurd interaction to another, clearly floundering, but still not seeing that it is up to him to create the life he wants. Not tomorrow, but right now. Advertisement What is truly delightful about the film is its loopy, gently slapstick sense of humor, its use of continuous running gags that pay off cumulatively (no small feat), and the dreamy sense that Schilling's somnambulism is pierced through only by the insane incomprehensible behavior of others. Schilling is a beautiful actor, accessible and vulnerable, and a veritable \"Everyman\" when compared to the kooks he encounters. Just one example of many: Niko has moved into a new apartment, and his nosy upstairs neighbor (Justus von Dohn\u00e1nyi) shows up at the door with a bowl of his wife's meatballs. The scene seems at first that it will be a friendly meet-and-greet until the neighbor, a big bulky guy, suddenly begins to open up about his lonely life, and how he just wants to watch football in peace, and how his wife recently had a mastectomy (he sobs, \"They took her whole rack!\"), and it ends with the man crumpling down the wall, weeping, all as Niko looks on. They have known one another 10 minutes when this operatic moment occurs. The scene is horrible. The scene is hilarious. It takes a very deft hand to handle such material: to make it both awkward and comedic, inappropriate and true. The film gains momentum as it goes along. There's a beautiful tension in every interaction. With each person Niko meets, you wait for the other shoe to drop.\u00a0He runs into an old classmate named Julika (Friederike Kempter), who seems happy to see him and yet also reminds him that he called her \"Roly Poly Julia\" back in school; she was sent to a \"boarding school for fat people\" to recover. She invites him to attend a performance-art piece put on by her theatre group, which leads to one of the funniest sequences in a film full of funny sequences. Anyone who has ever sat through an overly-earnest performance art piece and yearned to laugh, or at least inject some irony into the proceedings, will relate. There's even a movie-within-a-movie, as Niko and his friend Matze (Marc Hosemann) visit the set of a film being shot in Berlin so that Matze (an aspiring actor) can try to weasel his way into a part. One of Matze's friends plays the lead in the movie-within-a-movie, and it's the story of a romance between an SS officer and a Jewish woman. The friend, in his SS uniform, tells Niko and Matze the plot and gets so worked up by his fictional character's dilemma that he wells up with tears, all as his listeners squirm with embarrassment. Extras mill around outside, some wearing yellow stars and some wearing Swastikas, smoking cigarettes and talking shop. Advertisement The score of \"A Coffee in Berlin\" (original music composed by Cherilyn MacNeil and The Major Minors) is soft and jazzy, light and flippant, creating a comedic mood even when the actual events seem bleak. Niko confesses early on that he often doesn't understand what other people are saying to him, that they speak the same language but somehow he's not getting the message. His openness to others, and then his gentle confusion as things go south (and they always do), is part of his isolation, and also why the film is so strangely and consistently funny. Cinematographer Philipp Kirsamer manages to fill the film with a bustling sense of the urban sprawl of Berlin, with Niko making his way through all of the busses and trains and subway stations, as well as a collage-impression of a city in flux, with vacant lots, graffiti, empty squares at dawn. It's all part of the larger world with which Niko cannot seem to connect. Niko is thwarted throughout the film in his quest to get a cup of coffee. The coffee machine is broken, or the vending machine is out of order, or the urn is empty, or a simple cup of coffee costs over three Euros. As \"A Coffee in Berlin\" goes on, the lack of coffee becomes emblematic of the feeling that the world is somehow massed against him. His relationship with his dad is horrible, his finances have been cut off, Roly Poly Julia has some potential but maybe she is as nutty as everyone else, and Niko can't seem to get a foothold on meaning, relevance, or action. The continued running gag of no coffee gets an enormous emotional payoff in the film's contemplative final moment. \"A Coffee in Berlin\" veers confidently from melancholy to absurdity and back, and then back again. It's amazing that it hangs together as well as it does. The film is both silly and profound, a rare combination.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Escobar: Paradise Lost", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Few actors feel as present as Benicio Del Toro, a performer\r\nthat doesn\u2019t play-act, he embodies the characters he portrays. In \u201cEscobar:\r\nParadise Lost,\u201d Del Toro could be playing with children in a pool or ordering a\r\nyoung man to commit murder, and he performs both scenes with the same genuine\r\nintensity. He has such a keen awareness of his surroundings, whether it be his\r\nco-stars, shooting location, or even the few pounds he put on to play someone\r\nas larger than life as Pablo Escobar. He\u2019s really very good here, as he almost\r\nalways is, no matter the quality of the film around him. The rest of the movie?\r\nNot so much.

It truly will be paradise\u2014and debut\r\ndirector Andrea Di Stefano does a solid job of conveying the beauty of this\r\npart of the world. One day, Nick runs into a lovely young woman named Maria\r\n(Claudia Traisac), who asks if he\u2019s going to bring more \u201cYankees\u201d down to their\r\npart of their world. Nick politely corrects her; he\u2019s Canadian. Nick is very\r\npolite. Nick is also a tad na\u00efve. When Maria introduces him to her\r\nrich uncle Pablo Escobar, Nick doesn\u2019t exactly ask the right questions. He does\r\nhappen to wonder aloud how Uncle Pablo has so much money, to which Maria\r\ncasually answers, \u201cCocaine.\u201d Huh? You don't say. Not long later, Nick mentions over polite conversation that some\r\nlocal thugs have been giving him and his brother trouble, including attacking\r\nNick with a violent dog (in a harrowing scene). Anyone who\u2019s seen a movie will\r\nknow the thugs end up dead. And then Nick happens to be on the Escobar estate\r\non a day that he\u2019s not supposed to be there, and things get really bad. Advertisement The second half of \u201cParadise Lost\u201d is actually a pretty\r\nrobust thriller, especially a centerpiece action-suspense scene in which Nick\r\nstruggles to keep his head above water as the world is crashing around him.\r\nThere\u2019s a harrowing phone call or two and some really strong sense of setting,\r\nbuoyed by confident direction, especially for a first-time director. Here\u2019s the\r\nmoment where I realized that it\u2019s not Josh Hutcherson\u2019s fault that his\r\ncharacter doesn\u2019t really work, and not really even Di Stefano\u2019s, but the fact\r\nthat this is two movies grafted into one. On one hand, we have a true story of\r\ncrime and poverty bringing down paradise on Earth. On the other, we have the\r\nstory of an innocent caught in a web of violence. Both films kind of work, and both films are lessened by the way they are smashed together here. Were this just a straightforward,\r\nfictional thriller, it might be pretty effective. But it\u2019s not. The name is right there in the title. And\r\nevery time that Benicio Del Toro shows up as Pablo Escobar, we\u2019re reminded of\r\nthe movie that this could have been, making it easier to criticize the movie it\r\nchose to be instead.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Monuments Men", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"The Monuments Men\" tests the proposition that an appealing cast can put almost any script across. Near the start of this World War II drama about Yanks searching for art stolen by the Germans, star\u00a0George Clooney asks, \"Who will make sure that the statue of David is still standing and the Mona Lisa is still smiling?\" and the audience thinks, \"Why you, George, and your merry band of character actors playing over-the-hill soldiers, and us, if we can tag along too.\" By the midway point, that rah-rah sentiment has downshifted to, \"You guys, I guess\u2014and where are we now?\" By the end, it's something like, \"Wake me when you find that statue you're always talking about.\" Advertisement That's a harsh assessment of a film whose heart is in the right place, but heart alone does not a good film make. Directed by Clooney from a script he wrote with his regular filmmaking partner Grant Heslov, \"The Monuments Men\" is a throwback to a very specific type of World War II adventure picture: a star-studded adventure made between ten and 20 years after the war's end. Such films were aimed at a morally exhausted U.S. audience that wanted to be congratulated for its role in ending tyranny\u2014however large or small or nonexistent it might have been\u2014but that also wished to be entertained, preferably with a caper, a romance, and knowing jokes about bureaucrats and regulations.\u00a0 Clooney and Heslov's film offers all these elements, plus an alternately rousing and lyrical score by Alexandre Desplat that evokes \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" and \"The Great Escape.\" (Brass, kettle drums, whistling.) As the movie sends Clooney, Matt Damon, Bob Balaban, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville and Jean Dujardin\u2014playing art historians or art experts of one kind or another\u2014in search of German-pilfered paintings and statuary, it adds something else as well: an appreciation of how hard it is to get people to care about art when cities have been reduced to rubble and whole populations wiped out.\u00a0 The movie's best quality is its willingness to be real about the heroes' prospects and illustrate how hard it is to make a moral or philosophical case for their mission when millions have already died. When a field officer informs Clooney's Frank Stokes that even though a particular church contains significant art, they'll still bomb it if Germans decide to use it as a hiding place, you understand in practical terms where he's coming from, because the lead-up to this conversation took you to the beach at Normandy, post-D-Day, then past many bombed-out cityscapes. \"The Monuments Men\" presents its heroes as mice skittering through the margins of history, trying not to get stepped on. They're mostly too old or out-of-shape to be effective soldiers, and they're aware that the combat troops they pass in the field would support their mission only to the point where they had to choose between saving a Picasso and getting shot. Advertisement John Frankenheimer's action thriller \"The Train,\" starring Burt Lancaster as a French resistance fighter trying to stop Germans from looting the country's art at the end of the war, covered these themes in some depth, but with a grimy, sinewy, immediate quality. \"The Monuments Men\" is going for something different: a realistic portrait of wartime, one that shows the heroes being thwarted by higher-ups who aren't bad people but just have different priorities, and that isn't afraid to wander off into nooks and crannies of the main plot and let its characters hang out and just exist.\u00a0 This would all be wonderful news if the film had a discernible shape and a bit of cinematic flair. Unfortunately, it's the most visually un-dynamic film George Clooney has ever directed, a succession of plain vanilla long-shots and closeups that betray no sense of how to block actors within a moving frame. (Odd how each new film Clooney makes is\u00a0less\u00a0visually interesting than the one before; it's as if you're witnessing a learning curve in reverse.)\u00a0Clooney and Heslov's screenplay, meanwhile, amounts to a series of handsomely decorated, intelligently acted, pleasantly shaped, sometimes amusing scenes that ultimately don't add up to much. The not-quite-romantic subplot between Damon's character and Cate Blanchett\u2014cast as a Belgian secretary for the German who's organizing most of the art thievery\u2014is not charming, not sexy, and ultimately doesn't even make much dramatic sense; there are more botched subplots where that one came from.\u00a0Every now and then, Clooney will chime in via voice-over to tell you where everyone's going, or what that scene that just ended meant to the unit, and to the mission. The narration is so slapped-together-sounding that you can picture the star in a recording studio scribbling lines on a legal tablet while viewing a scene that's not coming across, recording a passage in his affably gruff voice, then turning to the booth to say, \"I'm thinking maybe one more take, but this time without the word 'deployed.'\"\u00a0 Every now and then, \"The Monuments Men\" produces a memorably charming or haunting moment. There's an appropriately underplayed sequence of the men discovering a wooden barrel filled with tiny, misshapen bits of gold, then riding a freight elevator in silence as they think about where the bits came from. There's a fine comic scene of Balaban instantly seeing through a deception, but taking his sweet time exposing it because he's trying to get his mind around how stunningly obvious it is. The initial \"getting the team together\" montage has a brief close-up that reminds of what a truly great actor John Goodman is: he suggests a character's entire self-image through the jaunty way he cocks his helmet.\u00a0This is not a terrible movie. It's just not consistently good enough to get excited about. It's the kind of film that you'll stumble across on TV, watch for a few minutes thinking, \"This is all right, I don't know why everybody was so hard on it,\" then change the channel.

{"Title": "Under the Skin", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Is \"Under the Skin,\" in which Scarlett Johansson plays a mysterious woman luring men into a fatal mating dance, a brilliant science fiction movie\u2014more of an \"experience\" than a traditional story, with plenty to say about gender roles, sexism and the power of lust? Is it a pretentious gloss on a very old story about men's fear of women, and women's discomfort with their own allure? Does it contain mysteries that can only be unpacked with repeat viewings, or is it a shallow film whose assured style and eerie tone make it seem deeper than it is? Is there, in fact, something beneath the movie's skin? Why is every sentence in this paragraph a question? Advertisement I can answer that last one: \"Under the Skin,\" Jonathan Glazer's first film since 2004's \"Birth,\" is special because it's hard to pin down. It doesn't move or feel like most science fiction movies\u2014like most movies, period. It's a film out of its time. Its time, I think, is the 1970s, when directors like Alejandro Jodorowsky (\"El Topo,\" \"The Holy Mountain\") and Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now,\" \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\") made viscerally intense features with subjective visuals and sound effects and music and dissociative editing.\u00a0Certain modern filmmakers still work in this mode occasionally\u2014for instance, the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, whose 1998 film \"A Taste of Cherry\" shares some odd similarities with \"Under the Skin.\" As you watch any of those films, you think about what they're trying to say, or what they \"mean,\" or on a much simpler level, what the heck is happening from one minute to the next. But at a certain point you realize that on the simplest level, such films are saying: \"Here is an experience that's nothing like yours, and here are some images and sounds and situations that capture the essence of what the experience felt like; watch the movie for a couple of hours, and when it's over, go home and think about what you saw and what it did to you.\" \u00a0 The opening of \"Under the Skin\" might remind you of the openings of \"2001,\" \"Blade Runner\" or \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" or certain movies by Paul Thomas Anderson: an immersive, hypnotic gambit that feels like the mental equivalent of a palate cleanser. As Mica Levi's score buzzes like an otherworldly hornet's nest, we see a black screen with a tiny white dot in the middle. The dot grows incrementally larger, or closer, before shaping itself into a pattern of rings that simultaneously suggests a birth canal dilating, the stages of a rocket separating, and a lunar eclipse as seen through a telescope's lens. What's happening? The movie doesn't exactly tell us. Maybe this is the heroine, Johansson's character, falling to earth, or landing on earth. Maybe. Then see a man on a motorcycle retrieving the body of a young woman (also Johansson) and the woman donning her body as one might don a set of clothes. Who is the motorcyclist? Is he her mate? Her procurer? Her handler? Who is she? An astronaut? The vanguard in an alien invasion? An intergalactic sex tourist visiting Earth as an American might visit Amsterdam or Bangkok?\u00a0The opening is the first of many sequences in \"Under the Skin\" that feel more figurative than \"real\"\u2014moments in which we suspect we're seeing the poetic representation of a thing, not necessarily the thing itself.\u00a0 Most of the movie does, however, feel \"real,\" particularly scenes of the woman driving around Glasgow, Scotland, enticing men to get into her white van and follow her to an abandoned flat where, it is implied, they have sex. The men (shot by hidden cameras in a series of improvisations) seem like real men. They aren't movie star handsome. They're young, alert and engaging. Some are funny and seem like they might even have a chance with an attractive young woman who was not an extraterrestrial looking for a hookup. The unnamed heroine seems genuinely intrigued by their banter, sometimes amused, never in a condescending way. She seems to be learning about this new environment and the people in it, and enjoying herself when she isn't anxious about passing for human.\u00a0 Advertisement But once we join the woman and her men in the vacant apartment, the film turns figurative again. The men follow the heroine through a pitch black doorway that's yet another symbolically charged portal; it's as if, by stepping through it, both she and they are being born, or reborn. Once the couples step through, we don't see any sex, just nudity plus movement, in what might be a musical number choreographed by performance artists. The frame is completely black except for the woman and her prey. They both take their clothes off, item by item. The woman always backs away from the man, slowly, confidently, but with an eerily blank expression (most of Johansson's expressions are eerily blank, except when she's unexpectedly laughing or showing confusion or fear). The man walks forward, but seems to trudge lower and lower into a black pool. The heroine, meanwhile, continues to walk backward on the pool's undisturbed surface.\u00a0 The leading lady gives a performance different from any you've seen from her. It's keenly attuned to the movie's aesthetic. It's more about intuition and gesture than dialogue.\u00a0Johansson has to be at once achingly specific and so general that you can hang symbols on her. She pulls it off. And somehow Johansson, Glazer and his cinematographer Daniel Landin transform how we think of this star. They've taken one of the most glamorous actresses of the modern era\u2014a woman whose looks have been abstracted into hubba-hubba caricature in most films, and on awards shows\u2014and ironically restored her earthliness by having her play a creature not of this earth. They've made her beautiful in a real way, with hips and blemishes and folds in her skin.\u00a0 There are hints of an unspoken psychic bond between the woman driving around in the white van picking up men and the mysterious motorcyclist zipping around Glasgow, hugging the curves of hilly roads that dip and snake like the ones in the opening sequence of \"The Shining\"\u2014but we never find out precisely what the connection is.\u00a0There are times when the heroine is a vessel emptied of meaning. Other times she seems like a human struggling to learn the subtle everyday details of a new culture. She speaks in an English accent, the men in thick Scottish accents. The absence of subtitles adds to the feeling that she's a stranger in a strange land, and makes us empathize with her as we try to understand the men. We study their facial expressions and gestures to plug gaps in meaning.\u00a0 Advertisement She's the woman as Other, yet she's also \"just\" a woman, or \"just\" an alien creature. She is everything and nothing.\u00a0There are times when the film seems to be too freighted with meaning, as if inviting scholars to write thesis papers analyzing its masculine and feminine symbols. At other times it seems to be deliberately mocking such impulses, giving false clues to literal-minded viewers who insist on trying to \"solve\" movies like equations. But the film's disturbing finale goes beyond such simplistic \"this=that\" analysis. First it removes all doubt as to who the heroine is\u2014what her \"secret\" is. Then goes beyond such questions, so that you feel a mix of despair and wonder not unlike what you'd feel at the end of a melodrama, or a Grimm fairy tale whose ending, however dreadful, is not depressing because it feels\u00a0right. \u00a0 Movies like this don't find their way into commercial cinemas very often. When they do, they don't tend to star anyone you've heard of. When a film comes along that doesn't fit the usual marketplace paradigms, such as \"The Tree of Life\" or \"Upstream Color\" or \"Spring Breakers,\" you take notice. \"Under the Skin\" is a film in that vein. Right after it ended, I argued its merits with a friend who didn't care for it, and I jokingly referred to it as \"what would happen if Michelangelo Antonioni directed 'Species.'\" It sounds like a glib joke, but I meant it as a compliment to the movie's mix of horror film menace and intellectualized control. It seems to hard to believe today, now that the pantheon of great directors has hardened into consensus, but there was a time when people thought there was less to Antonioni than met the eye, too. On the basis of this film, \"Birth\" and his debut \"Sexy Beast,\" Glazer strikes me as a director in the same weight class as Antonioni and all the other great filmmakers I've name-dropped in this piece, including Kubrick, the artist Glazer most often evokes. (Like Kubrick, Glazer takes his time\u2014this is only his third feature in 13 years\u2014and like Kubrick, he becomes more formally audacious, technically innovative, and inscrutable with each new work.) I wanted to watch \"Under the Skin\" more than once before I reviewed it. Life got in the way of that. No matter: I feel secure in saying that it's going to end up on my list of the year's best movies. I saw it almost a week ago and it has never been far from my mind. Is it perfect? Probably not. It might be too much of something, or too little of something else. Time will sort out the particulars. But I do know that the movie's sensibility is as distinctive as any I've seen. \"Under the Skin\" is hideously beautiful. Its life force is overwhelming.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Rob the Mob", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In 1991, as New York City stopped in its tracks to follow the trial of mob boss John Gotti, a story briefly took over the front pages, a sideshow to the main event: a crazy in-love couple from Queens, taking advantage of the chaos in the organized crime world, started holding up various Mafia social clubs, pocketing the cash. They knew the Mob wouldn't contact the police. And was it really a crime to steal from such obviously bad guys in the first place? \"Rob the Mob,\" directed by Raymond De Felitta and written by Jonathan Fernandez, looks at the sideshow from multiple angles. Breezy, sleazy, and sometimes-intense, \"Rob the Mob\" depicts a very specific sliver of time in New York history, a time overrun by crack, graffiti, and omnipresent organized crime.  Advertisement Tommy (Michael Pitt) and Rosie Uva (Nina Arianda) have recently emerged from short stints in prison for holding up a florist's shop. They are in love. Rosie has gotten a job at a debt collection agency, run by a smiling enthusiastic guy (Griffin Dunne) who likes to hire ex-cons (he himself did time for fraud). Rosie, a woman with an ingratiating supportive attitude and a big laugh which masks her intellectual shortcomings, convinces her boss to also hire Tommy. When money is tight one month, they decide on their reckless quick-cash crime spree. Rosie drives the get-away car and Tommy, wearing a ski-mask, does the stick-up, accidentally firing off the Uzi into the ceiling and back walls. The group of \"wise guys\" in the club empty their wallets, all while issuing threats of what they will do when they track him down. When Tommy and Rosie go home to their bleak cold-water flat, they laugh and commiserate over how easy it was.  \"Rob the Mob\" doesn't just stick with Tommy and Rosie. It looks at their crime spree from the perspective of the dogged Federal agent (Frank Whaley) searching for specific Intel on the structure and hierarchy of the New York crime families. We also meet a journalist named Jerry Cardozo (an excellent Ray Romano) who has been covering the Mob for 30 years, and writes a front page story about the mysterious criminal duo, naming them \"Bonnie and Clyde\". He is shocked when, one day, Rosie calls him at his desk to correct one of the facts in his story. We also get scenes of the paranoia within the Mob, brought on by the one-two punch of the Gotti trial and the sudden crime spree. The Mafia here is headed up by a reclusive boss with a mysterious past named \"Big Al\" (played by Andy Garcia, with a white Ernest Hemingway beard in a performance of coiled intensity.)  During one of their stick-ups, Tommy and Rosie steal the wallet of a guy named Joey D. (Burt Young). In the wallet is a folded piece of loose leaf paper, and on it is written what becomes known as \"The List\": a family tree of the Mob, its internal structure, its command set-up. Private home phone numbers are listed. As the Gotti trial goes on downtown, police and FBI work overtime trying to figure out who reported to whom in the organization, and, of course, there is no H.R. department. \"The List\" would represent the break they need. But Tommy and Rosie, whose bravery explodes into increasing delusional mania with each successful stick-up, decide to use \"The List\" as a bargaining chip with the Mob, and they start making threatening phone calls to everyone on it.  Advertisement \"Rob the Mob\" romanticizes Tommy and Rosie, filming them in slo-mo dancing through raining dollar bills, and kissing in the rain on a deserted Coney Island boardwalk, but the couple lacks the iconic power of other famous crime-spree cinematic duos, including their namesake. The romantic treatment of some of their scenes and the sentimental soundtrack is all counter-acted by casting Pitt and Arianda, who inhabit their roles familiarly, grubbily, easily. Both actors portray characters who are clearly not smart, not even a little bit, but they do so without being patronizing about it. You don't get the sense that they, the actors, are \"slumming\". Tommy and Rosie have no self-awareness, and no powers of self-reflection. Tony award-winning Arianda, in particular, is fascinating to watch. She was fascinating to watch in her small part in \"Midnight in Paris,\" where she droningly and happily repeated whatever her snobby husband said. Arianda's Rosie is filled with enthusiasm and support for those around her (watch, in particular, how she butters up her boss, cheering him on like they're at a pep rally), and despite her initial resistance to Tommy's plan, she finally embraces it wholeheartedly. She's not killing anyone. She's stealing from bad men. \"What's the crime in that?\" she asks Cardoza, grinning at him chummily over her slice of pizza. Arianda shows Rosie's shallow grasp of abstract concepts in a frozen smile and confused flicker in her eyes when confronted with something she doesn't understand. Cardoza says to her, \"We got a saying in the newspaper world--\" and she cuts him off, brightly, supportively, missing the entire point: \"I love sayings! Slogans!\"  The rest of the cast is populated by stalwart long-time New York actors, grounding the film in its location and era. Cathy Moriarty shows up in a heartbreaking cameo as Tommy's devastated mother, wrecked by a lifetime of disappointment and violence. Moriarty gives another unforgettable cameo performance in the upcoming \"The Double\". It's exciting to think of the direction her career is taking.  \"Rob the Mob\" is too cutesy a title for this dark grubby little tale.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Being Evel", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Does the world really need another movie about Evel Knievel?\r\nWell it depends. The pioneering (in a sense) motorcycle daredevil has already\r\nbeen the subject of two fiction films\r\n(one in which he played himself, or \u201chimself\u201d), one self-produced documentary,\r\na good number of television specials and retrospectives. Knievel himself passed\r\naway in 2007\u2014not in any kind of stunt accident but rather from a pulmonary\r\nailment, exacerbated, reportedly, by Hepatitis C, which the performer likely\r\ncontracted from one of countless blood transfusions\u2014and the above-mentioned\r\nmovies have long been forgotten by all but the most dedicated cultists. Which\r\nis, in a way, too bad. The first fictional Knievel movie, in 1971, starred George\r\nHamilton as the cycle maniac and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Lolita, Sue Lyon, as his\r\nwife. 1977\u2019s \u201cViva Knievel,\u201d which featured\r\nthe man himself at the height of his hubris (he didn\u2019t cotton to having been\r\nplayed by Hamilton six years before) costarred Gene Kelly (!) and was directed\r\nby deft Hollywood journeyman Gordon Douglas. Given Knievel\u2019s general\r\ndisposition at the height of his fame, directing him is (to paraphrase Steve\r\nAlbini) a job I wouldn\u2019t wish on a dog I didn\u2019t like.  Advertisement Anyway. The point is that the phenomenon that was Evel\r\nKnievel\u2014and he was indeed a phenom\u2014doesn\u2019t get much recognition in contemporary\r\nculture, despite the fact that, as interview subject and co-producer of the\r\nmovie Johnny Knoxville notes early on, the guy kind of invented extreme sports.\r\nThis highly conventional, intermittently\r\nengaging example of the Entertainment Documentary (you know, the kind that\r\nlivens up its talking heads with rear-projected imagery behind them, and\r\nfeatures animated reenactments, that sort of thing) outlines how this cocky kid\r\nfrom Butte, Montana became a post P.T. Barnum icon by essentially risking\r\nsuicide every time he got on a chopper. Discovering early on that he was kind\r\nof thrill crazy, he started using his cycle to jump over cars without any kind\r\nof mathematical calculation or preparation. He just got the cars lined up, put\r\nup the ramps, and went. This method held for quite some time, up to his\r\nill-fated but fame-producing missed-it-by-that-much jump over the fountains of\r\nVegas\u2019 Caesar\u2019s Palace and beyond.  This haphazard approach led to spectacular successes and\r\nperhaps even more spectacular failures. The footage of his crash after clearing\r\nthe Vegas fountains was the most replayed clip of its time. Similarly\r\ncringe-inducing is a scene from earlier in his career, in which he tries to\r\njump over an oncoming cycle, misjudges the timing, and takes a horrific spill.\r\nThe guy had a capacity for physical punishment that was equal to if not greater\r\nthan his talent for self-promotion. The movie interviews dozens of sports and\r\nmedia figures, including the recently passed Frank Gifford, who interviewed\r\nKnievel frequently on \u201cWide World Of Sports,\u201d and they all have wild, hairy\r\nstories of Knievel\u2019s bravery and wiliness. There\u2019s also bracing period footage\r\nof Knievel being a scowling jackass at Snake River Canyon, the site of one of\r\nhis most poorly conceived stunts, in which he attempted to rocket over the\r\naforementioned geological gap after being thwarted for over a decade in his\r\nquest to jump something over the\r\nGrand Canyon.  The movie is certainly colorful\u2014this is a guy who, when he\r\nhad it made, lived VERY large, even if he continued on what seemed like a quest\r\nto break every bone in his body multiple times. And it tells, as it keeps\r\nreminding us, a very American story. For all that, though, it doesn\u2019t\r\nilluminate the guy\u2019s character beyond what\u2019s obvious. Nor does it bestow much\r\ndepth upon Knievel. No, he\u2019s not a monster on the level of Jack \u201cPal\u201d Smurch in\r\nJames Thurber\u2019s caustic short story \u201cThe Greatest Man In The World.\u201d Although\r\nhe\u2019s depicted as behaving pretty badly, particularly with respect to\r\nwomen-chasing, what he does isn\u2019t all that unusual in the annals of late 20th\u00a0Century rags-to-riches guys who become dickheads when they\u2019ve got some cash in\r\ntheir pockets. There is, finally, even\r\nin his most vividly temper-flaring moments, something of a cipher about him.\r\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the movie (competently directed by Daniel Junge, also\r\nof \u201cA LEGO Brickumentary\u201d) or if it\u2019s\r\nhim.

Kayla wants in on the shared experience, and decides she\u2019ll do the deed with Connor (Miles Robbins), and Sam, even though she\u2019s way more interested in a lesbian at her school named Marcie (Sarayu Blue), decides she\u2019ll join in as well with her date. As the trio of couples head out on a night of debauchery, Julie accidentally leaves a group chat open on her laptop and the girls\u2019 parents, in a very funny scene, decipher the emojis and discern the plan. Even though Hunter initially balks, they head out to save the girls from doing something they\u2019ll regret.    Advertisement Despite what you may have thought from the trailers, Cannon is careful not to deliver a comedy that relies on the double standard that has long-defined teenage boys and girls regarding sex. In fact, Julie and Mitchell are constantly being called out on their bullshit. Lisa had Julie at a young age, and doesn\u2019t want the same for her daughter, but it\u2019s also crystal-clear that Julie is in love with Austin and this is no mere hook-up. In \"Blockers,\"\u00a0sex, and experimentation in general,\u00a0is treated as a natural part of the evolution into adulthood and it\u2019s the parents trying to hold it back who are the relics. Some of the best parts of\u00a0\u201cBlockers\u201d make it clear how much being overprotective leaves you stuck in time, and presents the teens as progressive/woke/etc. in a clever, modern way. Clearly, there are some decent ideas for a comedy in \u201cBlockers,\u201d and some very funny scenes from a cast with rock-solid comic timing, but the movie was either rewritten one too many times or one too few. Whatever the case, it\u2019s an understatement to say that it\u2019s all over the map tonally. The first half-hour or so really worked for me, as it became clear how much Cannon could get from a talented cast (not just the adults, but the kids work too, especially scene-stealer Viswanathan), but then \u201cBlockers\u201d falls into that trap where every subsequent scene has to up the ante in terms of insanity. It loses the emotional grounding that feels genuine in the opening scenes as the drugs, booze, and lunacy gets turned up to 11 in an effort to \u201ctop\u201d something like \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d or \u201cSuperbad.\u201d \u201cBlockers\u201d has five credited writers (Ed.-It did at SXSW but has since been reduced to two), and you would be able to guess that if I hadn't told you. It\u2019s just\u00a0incredibly difficult to balance the wildly divergent tones in a movie that features more sex jokes than any I\u2019ve seen in years with characters that feel real talking about going away to school and leaving their parents and friends.\u00a0 With that in mind, it\u2019s notable how close \u201cBlockers\u201d gets to working. The crowd I saw it with at SXSW\u2014a festival that\u2019s become notable for mainstream comedy debuts, launching \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d and more in recent years\u2014ate it up and used words like hysterical on their way out. The film is\u00a0undeniably funny, and I\u2019d like a world in which Cena/Mann/Barinholtz get more work\u2014AND, even more importantly, where more female directors are hired to direct R-rated studio\u00a0comedies. I just hope the next one is a little better than \u201cBlockers.\u201d This review was filed from the 2018 SXSW Film Festival on March 11, 2018. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Sicario", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cSicario\u201d opens with two indicators of a violent world, one a discovery and one an explosion, both setting the stage for the satisfying thriller that follows.\u00a0This is a universe in which evidence of evil exists in plain sight,\r\nhiding in the walls of a house in suburban America. And it is a world in which\r\nviolence can erupt in the blink of an eye, taking lives and shattering others.\r\nAt times, \u201cSicario\u201d is a deeply satisfying, intense examination of a war with\r\nno rules of engagement, driven by a spectacular performance by Benicio Del Toro\r\nand typically mesmerizing cinematography from Roger Deakins. At other times, especially\r\nin its middle act, \u201cSicario\u201d can be frustratingly self-indulgent, filled with\r\noverhead helicopter shots of the Mexican border and a thumping, pretentious\r\nscore. It\u2019s a film that lacks the urgency of the really great thrillers, but\r\nexists in that rarefied air of refined production values on every level and a\r\nflawless ensemble. That it falls short of greatness could be considered a\r\ndisappointment, but there\u2019s still much to like here. Advertisement That opening scene features FBI Agent Kate Macy (Emily\r\nBlunt) trying to find a kidnap victim in an Arizona home. She literally barrels\r\nthrough the wall in her truck, and just takes down a target as he unloads a\r\nshotgun in her direction. The shotgun blasts a hole in the wall, revealing a\r\ndead body, wrapped in plastic. And this cadaver is not alone. Soon, they\r\ndiscover the home is filled with corpses, and their investigation leads to an\r\nexplosion. What is going on? What horror has crossed the border from the\r\nnotoriously lawless town of Juarez to Arizona?  Macy\u2019s fearlessness and quick wit draws the attention of her\r\nsuperiors, and she\u2019s brought in on a meeting for an inter-agency task force.\r\nLed by a mysterious, professionally undefined (he could be CIA) man named Matt\r\n(Josh Brolin), the people behind this task force like what they hear from Kate.\r\nThey bring her aboard, and Matt, Kate and the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del\r\nToro) head South to capture a drug trafficker and bring him back to the States for\r\nquestioning. This sequence alone justifies a look at \u201cSicario.\u201d Venturing into\r\na part of the continent in which drug lords have become so prominent that dead\r\nbodies hang in public places as messages, the team has to act quickly. On the\r\nway back from Mexico, they get stuck in traffic at the border. Cars around them\r\ncould contain the drug trafficker\u2019s cronies, waiting to strike. This scene is\r\na master class in the production of tension. Deakins uses car windows\r\nbeautifully and editor Joe Walker seamlessly cuts the action together. That the\r\nmovie never tops this sequence again is where the problems arguably start. We\r\nopen with such intensity that the lack of sizzle in the second act starts to\r\ntake a toll. Part of the problem is that Taylor Sheridan\u2019s script doesn\u2019t\r\nreally develop a protagonist. Kate is too often an observer, an unwilling and\r\nuninformed traveler on this journey. Brolin\u2019s Matt and Del Toro\u2019s Alejandro are\r\nso clearly in charge of what\u2019s happening that they\u2019re thinking of moves several\r\nmachinations away while Kate is unclear of not only what role she\u2019s supposed to\r\nplay but what roles everyone has as well. I get that this sense of confusion is\r\npart of the point. \u201cSicario,\u201d at its core, is about a world in which the lack\r\nof leadership on either side of the drug war has created complete chaos. And so\r\nit makes sense that it would feature a protagonist equally confused by the lack\r\nof ground rules. However, this makes for a film that doesn\u2019t have the emotional\r\npunch of the best thrillers, at least not until the final act when the tables\r\nare turned, and we realize that we may have been focusing on the wrong story all\r\nalong. Advertisement Despite the issues I have with the narrative of \u201cSicario,\u201d\r\nit\u2019s impossible to deny the technical elements that are so far above average,\r\nand Denis Villeneuve\u2019s skill with directing actors. He draws a great performance\r\nfrom Brolin as the kind of guy who enjoys keeping those around him uninformed.\r\nHe considers intelligence as a tool to an upper hand. Del Toro has a very\r\ndifferent purpose, one that\u2019s slowly revealed, and he\u2019s simply magnetic here.\r\nHe steals every scene he\u2019s in. Blunt is typically excellent as well, even if it\r\nfeels like the underdrawn nature of her character is the film\u2019s biggest flaw. By the time \u201cSicario\u201d gets to its final act, and Villeneuve\r\nand Deakins approach \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d territory through strikes under the cover of darkness with night vision goggles,\r\nit\u2019s impossible to nitpick the screenplay. When life and death are in play,\r\nsuch as in that scene on the freeway, and really the entire final act, \u201cSicario\u201d\r\nrises to the level I hoped it would maintain the entire time. It becomes an\r\nentire film of that opening scene\u2014a movie of secrets and the threat of constant\r\nviolence. It\u2019s about a world that we can\u2019t really even comprehend\r\nwhen it comes to its lack of order and degree of atrocities. And it\u2019s in our\r\nbackyard.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Our Kind of Traitor", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The work of the British novelist John le Carr\u00e9 is inextricably linked, in the minds of many readers, with the Cold War. But he, like many others plugged into current events, has long understood that the fall of the Soviet Union did not, by any means, put an end to Russian, British and American-accented espionage hijinks. His 2010 novel, \u201cOur Kind of Traitor,\u201d capitalizes on explicit links between high profit gangsterism in the former USSR and government corruption in the West, whose self-righteous self-image is just one reason it likes to keep such things tightly under wraps.\u00a0 Advertisement \n The movie adaptation, directed by Susanna White and starring Ewan McGregor, Naomie Harris, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Damian Lewis, is a handsome and often absorbing picture. It begins with the depiction of an unusual ceremony, culminating in the bestowal of a pistol on someone we believe to be a lucky dealmaker; as is the custom in old gangster movies, however, the gift is in fact a \u201cmarked for death\u201d gesture, and several bleakly depicted murders follow, in the snow, yet. Cut to the altogether sultrier climes of Marrakesh, where McGregor\u2019s Perry Makepeace (nice name, John) is unsuccessfully trying to warm up longtime girlfriend Gail (Harris). A rift has occurred in their relationship, a bad one. And while it\u2019s not revealed for a while just what it was, it seems highly ill-advised for Perry, once by himself, to accept the invitation of a blustery Russian named Dima (Skarsg\u00e5rd) to go out and party with him. But go out and party with him he does, and while he\u2019s entranced by visions of (probable) call girls riding horses through the hallways of the site of the revels, he\u2019s also got sufficient conscience to step in and break up a sexual assault. Dima admires Perry\u2019s nerve, or stupidity, in this incident: the would-be rapist, a heavily tattooed ape, is, like Dima, a Russian mobster. Dima deems Perry either noble enough, or stupid enough, to entrust, and enlists him as a sort of carrier pigeon: Perry is to bring British intelligence a teaser of some incriminating evidence that Dima is willing to part with in exchange for safe haven for himself and his family in Britain. Seems he\u2019s under the impression that someone is going to be gifting him with a special pistol some time soon.\u00a0 \n Perry agrees, Gail semi-balks, and soon enough they\u2019re embroiled in a scheme headed by an agent who happens to have an agenda of his own pertaining to one of the British bigwigs on Dima\u2019s list of the corrupt. Far from a simple courier, Perry becomes a major player in the deal. Gail and Perry see their relationship healing as they get to know Dima and his family, and develop protective instincts toward them. Perry\u2019s a professor of poetics, and we see him teaching T.S. Eliot, and evoking Dante, one of Eliot\u2019s great heroes. Later in the movie a character speaks of a certain kind of espionage work as being for \u201cpeople disillusioned with their lives, who have lost their way \u2026 giv[ing] them back a sense of purpose.\u201d Which of course evokes the opening of Dante\u2019s \u201cDivine Comedy,\u201d in which the protagonist, at middle age, finds himself lost in a forest. And the movie ends with a shot that evokes both Eliot\u2019s \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d and the video for Yes\u2019 \u201cOwner of a Lonely Heart.\u201d These touches are a bit heavyhanded, to be honest, even as the movie\u2019s action, featuring train travel to secret rendezvous spots and other pleasing bits of spy movie spycraft, will prove a pleasure to the genre fan. While White\u2019s direction is atmospheric, the sense of tension never gets crucial; the movie\u2019s got more of a mood of resignation than of conflict. For all its respectful and respectable qualities, it also suffers from a certain inertia.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Private Violence", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In the recent uproar following the release of the video footage showing  Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punching his wife Janay in the  elevator, a hashtag started trending on Twitter: #WhyIStayed. Beverly  Gooden, from North Carolina, did not watch the elevator footage, but  heard the commentary, the overwhelming refrain being, \"Why didn't she  just leave?\" A survivor of domestic violence herself, Gooden went on  Twitter and began a series of Tweets about why she stayed. The hashtag  started trending, as more and more people started sharing their stories.  It made national news. HBO's new feature-length documentary, \"Private  Violence,\" directed by Cynthia Hill, has been over a decade in the  making, but its release could not come at a more opportune time. A look  at the complexity of domestic violence, especially when it comes to the  difficulty of prosecuting abusers in a court of law, \"Private Violence\" keeps its focus narrow, a smart choice, following around Kit Gruelle, a victims' advocate from North Carolina. Advertisement Kit Gruelle lives in the mountains of North Carolina, and works with  women's shelters and law enforcement on various domestic abuse cases  about to enter the court system. She also trains first responders,  police officers and hostage negotiators on the complexities of what  goes on in domestic abuse situations. There is a fascinating scene  showing a role-playing scenario where two cops in training interview an  arguing \"couple\" (in reality, domestic abuse advocates). The cops  afterwards are taught what they did right, what they did wrong, what  signals they missed and what red flags they ignored. This is very important  work. Misconceptions and preconceived notions, not to mention  prejudices and judgmental attitudes, leave victims at risk. As a survivor of an abusive relationship herself, Gruelle is able to  communicate powerfully to those who cannot understand why people stay in  violent situations, and why they often keep going back. At one point, when  describing her own relationship, Gruelle says, \"I would always go back  because at least then I knew where he was.\" \"Private Violence\" highlights the diversity of  Gruelle's tasks, featuring her driving around from courthouses to  shelters to doctor's offices, back to her home in the mountains. There  are a couple of moments where Gruelle is shown listening to something,  the testimony of a survivor, or, in one scene, a terrible tape sent to  her of a man whipping his wife, screaming \"Don't you ever cross me!,\" and,  in those scenes, Hill zooms in on Gruelle's eyes, catching the  intensity of the listening going on there. Those are riveting and  empathetic moments. One can see why Hill was so taken with Gruelle as a  subject. \"Private Violence\" also presents the horrifying case of Deanna Walters, a woman kidnapped by her husband  and driven across the country against her will with their 2 1/2-year-old  daughter. He beat Deanna all along the way; so badly in Oklahoma that  he almost killed her. The police officer who finally pulled the truck  over and called an ambulance, said, \"In the 15 years I've been a law  enforcement officer, I've never seen anybody in a car wreck as badly  beat up as that girl.\" However, Deanna's husband was not charged with  anything and allowed to return home to North Carolina. Deanna's daughter  was placed in foster care (Deanna saying, quietly, \"That destroyed  me.\") Because the two had crossed so many state lines, and because  Deanna didn't know what state she was in half the time, there was fear  that the case would get lost in the shuffle, and that nobody would want  to prosecute it on a state-level. Gruelle and others hoped that his  multiple crimes (kidnapping, assault) could be tried in a federal court  where the punishment might be steeper. (Gruelle is quick to point out  the terrible irony that kidnapping is a worse offense in the eyes of the  law than beating someone so badly she almost dies and continues to have  seizures as a result of the beating.) Deanna Walters had been asked  repeatedly, by friends, family, and then law enforcement and lawyers,  the common question: \"Why didn't you leave him?\" Gruelle points out:  Deanna did leave him. And he retaliated by kidnapping  her and then almost killing her. Advertisement \"Private Violence\" is the story the important  work of Gruelle, of Deanna Walters' case, and of the American court  system, the giant loopholes in the law, and the multiple problems with  enforcing restraining orders (as well as prosecuting those who violate  such orders.) Gruelle, appearing on a radio show, comes with a stack of  files over a foot high of restraining orders that had been violated, resulting in the women being murdered. Gruelle says, \"I refer to  restraining orders as a last will and testament.\" As long as survivors are asked \"Why didn't you just leave?\" there will  be a need for advocates such as Kit Gruelle. And as long as there are  people out there like Gruelle, doing the frustrating and often thankless  work of not only keeping victims safe but bringing their abusers to  justice, there is hope. \"Private Violence\" is extremely sad, but it has a lot of hope. \"Private Violence\" opened Friday in limited release and plays tonight, October 20, 2014 on HBO.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Ridiculous 6", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "I\u2019ll be honest. While I really do try not to form any\r\nopinion at all before watching a film, I approached Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d with some understandable trepidation. The stories of a script so racist\r\nthat several of the Native Americans involved in the project walked off the set didn\u2019t\r\nexactly fill me with hope, and Sandler\u2019s comedy track record has been spotty at\r\nbest, somehow getting even lazier as his career has devolved into getting studios\r\nto pay for his vacations (\u201cJust Go with It,\u201d \u201cBlended\u201d). When Netflix decided\r\nto not screen it for TV or film critics before it premiered on their streaming\r\nservice today, it felt like the final straw. Little did I know how bad it would\r\nbe. The combined \u2013isms of a script in which a Native American character is\r\nnamed \u201cBeaver Breath\u201d are overwhelmingly unfunny enough, but it\u2019s really only one aspect\r\nof the monumental failure on display in a film that is almost bafflingly bad.  Advertisement Where do we begin? The recurring joke about a burro with\r\ndiarrhea that can spray across the room? The extended bit in which a man scoops\r\nout his right eye? The character who is supposed to be so dumb that he thinks\r\nwomen poop babies and says \u201ccanty-lopes\u201d\r\nand \u201cpanty-cakes\u201d? The fact that\r\nVanilla Ice plays Mark Twain and actually says, \u201cMake it rain like Twain\u201d as he antes into a poker game? You read that\r\nright\u2014Vanilla Ice plays Mark Twain.\r\nHow about the multiple occasions in which you can see people like Blake Shelton\r\nand Will Forte look around and basically say, \u201cCan you believe we\u2019re getting paid for this?\u201d It\u2019s like someone\r\nmade a bet that they could take money from a major company like Netflix and do\r\nthe absolute bare minimum with it. The best place to start is probably with Adam Sandler\u2019s\r\nhalf-asleep, horrendous performance\u2014the worst of his career\u2014in the lead role of\r\nTommy, aka White Knife, a man raised by the Apaches to have superhuman fighting\r\nskills. Sandler can\u2019t decide if Tommy should be the stoic, leader of this gang\r\nof misfits or the wacky Native American stereotype he likely first conceived him as, and so he makes no choice at all outside of \"sleepy.\" He can\u2019t hide\r\nhis disdain or complete lack of interest in the project. I get that Sandler is\r\nmaking movies pretty much just to keep his friends employed at this point, but\r\nwould it be too much to ask to see an ounce of acting effort?  Tommy\u2019s journey begins when he meets his father, Frank\r\nStockburn (Nick Nolte), just before the old man is kidnapped by a bad guy named\r\nCicero (Danny Trejo). He leaves his tribe to find his dad, discovering along\r\nthe way that Frank was a busy man and Tommy has five half-brothers: Ramon (Rob\r\nSchneider), Lil Pete (Taylor Lautner), Herm (Jorge Garcia), Danny (Luke Wilson)\r\nand Chico (Terry Crews). They form \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d and set out to save their\r\nnewly-discovered patriarch. To say that Sandler and Tim Herlihy\u2019s script is \u201cepisodic\u201d\r\nwould be an understatement. It\u2019s a series of scenes only loosely connected by\r\ncast and location. I\u2019ve seen episodes of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in which the\r\nsketches seemed more of a single piece than parts of this film. One minute,\r\nthey\u2019re learning how to play baseball from John Turturro; another minute they\u2019re\r\nplaying poker with Vanilla Ice, David Spade and Blake Shelton. It\u2019s like\r\nsomeone put ideas for Western-themed sketch comedy on a board and then Sandler\r\nthrew darts at it to determine its order. The film has no flow, no rhythm, and\r\nabsolutely no reason to be 119 minutes. Advertisement And then there\u2019s the broad racism and misogyny of the piece.\r\nAfter the controversial walk-offs, Netflix claimed that this was \u201csatire.\u201d It\u2019s\r\nnot. There\u2019s nothing satirical about Sandler\u2019s bad Native American accent\r\n(which totally comes and goes, by the way) or Schneider\u2019s Hispanic caricature. Saying\r\nthat this is satire is like the drunk guy at the bar telling you how many black\r\nfriends he has after telling a racist joke. Don\u2019t fall for it. There are a pair of good-to-great Westerns coming out in the\r\nnext few weeks in theaters that should satisfy your need for gunslingers and\r\nhorse-riding. Much has been made of the impact that Netflix has had on the television\r\nlandscape. Given the fact that \u201cThe Ridiculous 6\u201d is the first of a\r\nfour-picture deal with the company, they seem to have little interest in making\r\nthe same impact in the world of film.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Mary and the Witch's Flower", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower,\u201d the first film from Studio Ponoc, an animation outfit founded by Studio Ghibli veterans Hiromasa Yonebayashi and Yoshiaki Nishimura after Ghibli closed its doors in 2015, starts in medias res, with a violent firestorm engulfing the screen. A small girl with bright red hair escapes the maelstrom by flying away on a broomstick, pursued by dolphin-squid-fighter-jet hybrids. She plunges down through the clouds and crashes into a field, where her stolen cargo of glowing blue flowers scatters, instantly transforming the landscape (trees burst out of the earth to towering heights in the blink of an eye). Who she is, where she is, and why she needs to escape isn\u2019t revealed until nearly the end of the film.\u00a0 Advertisement After the action-packed prologue, \u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower\u201d segues into another world entirely. In bucolic England, another red-haired little girl, Mary (Ruby Barnhill, in the English dub version), waits out the final days of summer vacation while staying at the home of her great-aunt Charlotte (Lynda Baron). The only other kid around is a boy named Peter (Louis Ashbourne Serkis), whom Mary takes a disliking to for no apparent reason. One day, she follows a black cat\u2014who appears to be beckoning her on, like the white rabbit in\u00a0Alice in Wonderland\u2014into the forest. Deep in the forest, she discovers a twisted tree with a broomstick embedded in its trunk and blue flowers glowing at its roots. Mary picks one of the flowers, and is promptly yanked into the sky by the broomstick, which whisks her\u2014and the cat\u2014to a mysterious colorful city floating in the middle of the clouds. This is Endor College, a school for witches. Headmistress Madame Mumblechook (Kate Winslet) gives the agog Mary a tour of the school and becomes convinced Mary is a prodigy, the likes of which she has never seen. \u201cRed-haired witches have always been supremely superior,\u201d she gushes. Mumblechook brings Mary to see Doctor Dee (Jim Broadbent), a small Lenin look-alike, who scribbles formulae on gigantic blackboards, trying to perfect his hush-hush experiments in transformation. He, too, is impressed by Mary\u2019s promise. All of this unfolds in a pure and almost stately atmosphere of accord and exchanged pleasantries. It\u2019s not until halfway through the film that any conflict arises. Is Endor too good to be true? Well, what do you think?\u00a0 \u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower\u201d tiptoes into some pretty interesting territory about magic, its proper and improper\u2014even immoral, unethical\u2014uses. Eventually, when Mary goes up against Mumblechook and Dee, she won\u2019t rely on magic to get her through but ingenuity and courage. This is not the expected path for a film about magic; it\u2019s saying, essentially, \u201cYou don\u2019t need it. You\u2019ve got everything you need with you already.\u201d I found this aspect of the film tremendously exciting, especially how it plays out in the final third.\u00a0 Advertisement The animators invoke worlds upon worlds in \u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower:\u201d the green woods and mist-filled forests of England rendered in swooning evocative watercolors, and the show-stopping Endor, a psychedelic space from out of a dream or drug trip, packed with strange objects, unexplainable phenomena, students floating by in soap bubbles, fountains morphing into human form, grotesque creatures loping out of the shrubbery and disappearing. Endor is dazzling in an off-putting way (similar to some of the \u201cworlds\u201d presented in \u201cThe Congress,\u201d where animated avatars engulf their originals.) The action sequences are intricate and thrilling.\u00a0 \u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower\u201d is based on\u00a0The Little Broomstick, a 1971 children\u2019s novel by popular British author Mary Stewart (who just died in 2014). It\u2019s not hard to picture J.K. Rowling reading\u00a0The Little Broomstick\u00a0as a child, getting swept away by the story of a regular kid (who\u2019s really not regular at all) attending a boarding school run by witches and warlocks. There\u2019s a lot here reminiscent of other stories, like\u00a0Alice in Wonderland,\u00a0Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter, as well as other films from the Studio Ghibli canon. Yonebayashi\u2019s Oscar-nominated \u201cWhen Marnie Was There,\u201d also adapted from a British YA novel published 50 years ago, features a little girl who discovers an abandoned mansion while staying with her relatives in the English countryside. Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s \u201cKiki\u2019s Delivery Service\u201d comes to mind, too, tracking the adventures of a young witch and her \u201cfamiliar,\u201d a cat named Jiji. \u201cMary and the Witch\u2019s Flower\u201d doesn\u2019t feel derivative, but it lacks the depth of these other explorations.\u00a0 Mary, as a character, is refreshingly unremarkable. She\u2019s a regular kid. She has empathy for animals. She\u2019s got a healthy temper. She takes joy in the simple things. She\u2019s helpful to her great-aunt. She hates her hair. She follows the gardener around asking him questions. She seems like a real child (Barnhill\u2019s performance is excellent). However, there\u2019s nothing\u00a0missing\u00a0for Mary.

{"Title": "Last Flag Flying", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cThe worst thing that could ever happen to anybody has landed on you \u2026 and now you just have to deal with it.\u201d And most of us, if we\u2019re lucky, don\u2019t have to deal with \u201cthe worst thing\u201d alone. Richard Linklater\u2019s moving \u201cLast Flag Flying,\u201d a quasi-sequel to Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cThe Last Detail,\u201d is a film built on the deeply humanist career of its filmmaker, one that is about, at its core, what we\u2019re willing to do for one another on our darkest days. It is about being there for people when they need a shoulder to cry on or a hand to help them get up. And it reflects Linklater\u2019s undeniable belief in humankind. Is there any filmmaker who so clearly loves his characters more than Linklater? Jesse and Celine in the \u201cBefore\u201d films; the kids of \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d and \u201cEverybody Wants Some!!\u201d; everyone in \u201cBoyhood\u201d\u2014Linklater\u2019s affection for the people he presents is palpable, and it\u2019s that graceful humanity that keeps \u201cLast Flag Flying\u201d from descending into melodrama. It dips a few too many times to stand with the filmmaker\u2019s best work, and a few asides into \u201cwacky old person behavior\u201d are regrettable, but this is another solid dramedy from one of our best working filmmakers. Advertisement Larry \u2018Doc\u2019 Shepherd (Steve Carell) has had an absolutely horrific year. His wife recently passed of cancer, and he just received news that his son, Larry Jr., died in combat in Iraq\u2014the film takes place in late 2003 (we see Saddam Hussein\u2019s capture on TV screens). The news that Larry has to accompany his son\u2019s body to Arlington has rattled him and he needs some people by his side to whom he hasn\u2019t spoken in decades, his two Vietnam buddies, Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and the Reverend Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne). Cranston is doing a loose riff on what Nicholson did in the original Ashby film, playing the rebellious, hard-drinking, tough-talking member of the trio; Fishburne is the now-religious man who hasn\u2019t lost the passion of his youth, he\u2019s merely channeled it into something else; Carell sometimes looks like a shell of a man, giving the most subdued performance, and one of the best, of his career. What follows is basically an actor\u2019s showcase in the form of a road movie.    And it\u2019s one heck of a showcase. Linklater has received ample credit throughout his career as one of our best writers, but his work with performers still feels underrated. Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, Jack Black, Julie Delpy\u2014Linklater has directed them to performances that would be on any highlight reel of their entire careers. And he does phenomenal work here as an actor\u2019s director, allowing Carell, Fishburne, Cranston, and relative newcomer J. Quinton Johnson (as a soldier who has to accompany the men) to do fantastic, character-driven work. There\u2019s great joy in watching actors this talented being given the space to develop their characters in such a way that the performer fades away and we only see the character. There\u2019s a scene near the end in which the quartet is conversing on a train in which I realized how well-rounded and developed all four performers were in that moment.    Sadly, Linklater and co-writer Darryl Ponicsan (who also wrote the book and \"The Last Detail\") don\u2019t always trust the truth of their situation, ladling on sitcom-ish asides that really grate, although none go on long enough to completely sink the film. The old guys getting confused for terrorists; going on an excursion to buy something mysterious called a cell phone; breaking down Eminem\u2019s \u201cWithout Me,\u201d which Sal is stunned to learn is sung by a white guy\u2014these are all regrettable diversions from the truth of the film because they all feel so completely like a writer\u2019s contrivances.    Advertisement \u201cLast Flag Flying\u201d is far more interesting when it gets philosophical. There\u2019s an interesting undercurrent of faith at play in this story\u2014faith in a higher power that leads one into life as a Reverend or faith in a system that orders young men to die in impossible wars, and ultimately a faith in each other to do the right thing. I wish it was even more daring in terms of how this theme is explored, but it\u2019s definitely there. I also wanted more examination of the individual vs. the institution, most reflected in the decision over whether or not to bury Larry in his uniform. Does the uniform represent the man who gave his life or the system that took it? And what about the flag? Again, I feel like there\u2019s a slightly more daring, thematically strident version of \u201cLast Flag Flying\u201d that could have elevated this movie from good to great if it were willing to be just a few degrees more challenging.    Linklater doesn\u2019t help the opinion some will have that this is a bit too manipulative with a score that hits the tinkly piano chords whenever emotion comes into the narrative, but I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit to being moved on more than one occasion. Death comes into all of our lives. If we\u2019re lucky, it doesn\u2019t come into our lives when it comes to our own children. We\u2019re not all so lucky. People very important to me are dealing with the injustice of death as I write this, and \u201cLast Flag Flying\u201d reminded me how essential it is to just be there for them in whatever capacity I\u00a0can. One of the last lines of the film is \u201cDoc needs us.\u201d Linklater is reminding people to be present when they\u2019re needed. Be aware. Be caring. Be truthful. Be alive. More than anything, just be human.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Game Over, Man!", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The stoner comedy style refined by Anders Holm, Blake Anderson and Adam DeVine on the Comedy Central hit \u201cWorkaholics\u201d for seven seasons has moved to Netflix and gotten even raunchier, crazier, and more defiantly reckless. \u201cWorkaholics\u201d meets \u201cDie Hard\u201d in the comedy \u201cGame Over, Man!,\u201d an admirably stupid affair that amply displays the abilities of its\u00a0comedic collaborators in a way that elevates it above many other Netflix original comedies but a movie that probably works better if you\u2019re seriously drunk or high. It\u2019s often clunky and often offensive, but there are moments that remind one how often \u201cWorkaholics\u201d was pretty damn funny in the way it captured a certain kind of man-child who can\u2019t leave the drunk/high/horny culture of college life behind even when they graduate to a cubicle. It will work best for those lamenting the cancellation of the Comedy Central hit that spawned it, but probably not much for anyone else. Advertisement \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d stars Holm, DeVine, and Anderson as three relatively interchangeable bros who work housekeeping at a fancy hotel. In their spare time, they work on a tech project called Skintendo, which is sort of a virtual reality thing, but they really use most of their time to get high and act like idiots (sort of like they did on \u201cWorkaholics\u201d). Leaning into the personalities developed on that show, Holm is the de facto leader of the group, mostly due to his ego, and Anderson is the sweeter, smarter member of the trio. DeVine is the borderline lunatic once again, giving the actor the chance to show off his physical comedy chops, and his willingness to do absolutely anything to get a laugh.    The action of the comedy takes place on the night of a major party at the rooftop bar of the hotel, hosted by the insanely popular and insanely wealthy Bey Awadi (Utkarsh Ambudkar). Just as the guys are mustering up the courage to present Bey with their tech startup idea \u201cShark Tank\u201d-style, a group of high-powered assassins (led by Neal McDonough and Rhona Mitra) take over the party. They\u2019re going to hold Bey and his party goers hostage, including a hotel employee played by Aya Cash of \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst,\u201d until they get millions of dollars transferred to their account. Our heroes stumble into a plan to stop them and save the hostages.    To say that \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d thrives on extreme comedy would be an understatement. Imagine the envelope-pushing humor of \u201cWorkaholics\u201d with no concern about offending advertisers. A few of the more extreme sequences in \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d feature autoerotic asphyxiation, attempts to torture Bey by making him toss another man\u2019s salad, and a severed penis used as a prop. It\u2019s the kind of thing that could send a conservative viewer to the hospital with cardiac arrest. I am far from a traditionally conservative viewer when it comes to comedy, but even I rolled my eyes at the ridiculousness of this whole enterprise a few times. On the one hand, there\u2019s something admirable about being willing to do anything for a joke. On the other, extremity isn\u2019t funny on its own unless you\u2019re really high.    Advertisement More problematic is how often \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d sabotages its best bits. There\u2019s a funny, extreme beat in which DeVine\u2019s character chooses to \u201chide\u201d by pretending to have choked himself to death with his dick in his hand in a closet. But then that bit is followed up by some pretty extreme homophobia. The \u201cWorkaholics\u201d brand of humor often pushes a joke past its breaking point\u2014where it goes from funny to annoying. And that happens more than once in \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d The best bits are often the quickest ones, including a scene with Shaggy that is undeniably funny, and the times when the comedians are just riffing off each other. And the movie gets markedly funnier as the pace picks up because of the plot. Early scenes that go on way too long\u2014there\u2019s a used condom bit that will likely have many viewers lunging for the SmartTV remote\u2014are supplanted by a quicker pace.\u00a0 \u201cGame Over, Man!\u201d is grotesque, violent, insane\u00a0and offensive\u2014in other words, it\u2019s kind of exactly what you\u2019d expect from a \u201cWorkaholics\u201d movie unrestricted by basic cable censors. If you\u2019ve never seen the show, you might want to dip your toe in the water with it before jumping into this deep end. If you\u2019re already familiar, suit up and dive in.

{"Title": "The Internship", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In one of the early scenes in \"The Internship,\" heroes Billy and Nick (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson) have a video-conference interview with two recruiters from Google at a computer in a public library. Billy and Nick are two forty-something wristwatch salesmen who lost their jobs when their company folded (nobody uses watches anymore). Both men are now adrift in a world that has passed them by. After a long night of sadly Googling the \"jobs for people with no skills\", Vaughn's Billy stumbles upon Google's competitive internship program and signs up himself and his buddy Nick for an interview. Batting away the children who want to get on the public computer, Billy and Nick shout at top-volume into the screen, despite the fact that they are told by the recruiters, \"Guys, we can hear you\". Billy and Nick jam their heads close together like an old vaudeville team posing for a manic promotional photograph and jabber right into the camera, exuding not only obvious technical incompetence but blatantly embarrassing need.  Advertisement Both men seem to be on the verge of mental collapse. They're Willy Lomans on speed. It's excruciating to watch. And hilarious. Directed by Shawn Levy and\u00a0written by Vince Vaughn and Jared Stern, \"The Internship\" stuffs some creaky gear-shifts and boring exposition in its first 15 minutes; even Will Ferrell's one scene falls a little flat. But the Google interview is the moment the film explodes. The energy is uproarious.\u00a0 Billy and Nick (miraculously, after that debacle of an interview), are chosen to join the Internship summer program at the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. They will compete with other \"Nooglers\" (that's what they're called, don't blame me!) for the coveted positions offered to only a couple of interns at the end of the summer. Billy and Nick, of course, are the oldest people in any room at Google. The college kids assigned to their team immediately treat them with scorn and disrespect, with good reason: Billy, in trying to describe an idea he has for an App (an idea that already exists, of course), keeps saying that after you take the picture with your phone, you put it \"on the line\".  The internship program is run by a Mr. Chetty, played wonderfully by Aasif Mandvi as a Google version of Lou Gossett, Jr.'s drill sergeant in \"An Officer and a Gentleman.\" Mr. Chetty is cold, frightening, and unapproachable. The other members of Billy and Nick's team are played by Tiya Sircar, Dylan O'Brien, Tobit Raphael, and Josh Brener. The script delineates every character smartly, following them on similar journeys of transformation over the course of the summer. Tobit Raphael is Yo Yo, a kid so pressured by his mother to be the best that he picks at his eyebrows (by the end of the film he only has one eyebrow). Tiya Sircar plays a bubbly young woman who talks a big game about her sexy \"cosplay\", only to reveal in a later scene that she's never had a boyfriend, and all her experiences are figments of her imagination. Dylan O'Brien's Stewart is a serious young man who can barely drag his eyes up from his phone; he displays the practical cynicism of a generation that knows that graduating from college is not a guarantee of anything.\u00a0 The team does not bond immediately, and nobody wants Billy or Nick slowing them down. It's tense. But during a ferocious Quidditch match with a rival team, filmed with the intensity of a World Cup final, Billy gives an inspirational speech to his team about a \"little welder girl\" who wanted to go to dance school and never gave up. It's extremely stupid and extremely enjoyable, and the team bonds and comes from behind to almost win the match. They start to work together. Billy and Nick play catch-up in terms of technology, and, of course, the old geezers have a couple of life lessons to teach the young whippersnappers, too. Everybody wins. Advertisement The movie depicts Google culture as if it were a benevolent version of life in a cult compound, with everyone wearing colored beanies and \"Noogle\" T-shirts, riding colorful Google bikes around the campus, and taking the Google shuttle bus into town. The interns compete in different challenges: coding, answering helpline calls, locating bugs. It's hard to believe that a scene about answering a Google helpline could be a gripping cliffhanger, but Levy and his cast pull it off.  There are a couple of problems with the material, none of which ended up mattering much to me. One is the glorification of Google as both a successful company and a mystical entity that makes the world a better place. This sentiment is treated without irony. The food is free at the commissary! There are \"nap pods\" where you can rest! There's a gigantic slide between floors! It's the best place ever! Another potential hitch is that Billy and Nick are angling for an anonymous entry-level job at a gigantic corporation that's hardly the Emerald City that everyone seems to think it is. How long would these two last in homogenized corporate culture, anyway? Do they really want to become a Noogler, filled with \"Googleyness\"? Their enthusiasm doesn't quite track. The flip side of these caveats, though, leads us to the underbelly of the film, its real guts. Google is just the excuse to tell a story about the challenges of growing older, the importance of taking risks, and what it means to be a man in a changing world (shades of Willy Loman again). On that level, the film is solid and quite effective. The moments of sentiment, when they come, feel fully earned, and they come out of characterization.\u00a0 In time you start to care about Yo Yo's emotional life, for example, and when he busts loose in one scene, it's quite satisfying. Owen Wilson's character has never had a relationship that lasts longer than a couple of months, and during his time at Google he begins a flirtation with a serious woman who is always on her way to a meeting (played by the fantastic Rose Byrne). She's a tough nut to crack, and there's a beautiful quiet scene in which she suddenly reveals some of her life regrets to Nick. The director handles the film's tonal dips and swerves confidently. He allows \"The Internship\" to slow down on occasion, and gives both the story and its characters room to breathe. The ending pumps up the suspense in an artificial way, but by that point the real work has already been done. It's not about winning the competition. It never was.\u00a0Billy and Nick are baffled by much of what they encounter at Google, and both have their challenges. They're only in their forties but they're already being treated as old and irrelevant; it's a new experience, one they are not yet used to.\u00a0 Both actors play that anxiety beautifully. You can see disappointment and fear flickering in Vince Vaughn's eyes: he is someone who is used to breezing through on his charm, but the charm is no longer working. He can't just grin at people anymore in a cute conspiratorial way and get away with murder. Everyone sees through him now. And Owen Wilson's Nick is a bit of a follower. As long as he had Billy by his side, he didn't have to make his own choices. Now it's time to step up and be an adult. Besides, some of the things they bring to the table at Google are relevant and necessary. At one point, Wilson gives Vaughn a pep talk, saying, \"You're tough! You grew up in the '70s! You didn't wear a bike helmet. You're tough!\"  Advertisement It's no surprise that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have such entertaining chemistry onscreen. We saw it before in \"The Wedding Crashers\", the gigantic sleeper hit of 2005. What is a surprise is that it has taken them this long to appear together again. In the studio system days, they would have been set to work cranking out comedies as an established duo, beloved by a vast audience. But in today's more individualistic, independent industry, it's taken Wilson and Vaughn nine years to get together again. It's good to see them.", "Critic": "Alpha"}

The first film had its issues, for\r\nsure, but at least it conveyed a DIY, nostalgic throwback to \u201880s horror that\r\ncould excuse some of its deeper flaws. And the second film had two segments\r\nthat I would call must-see, at least for horror fans. It was more polished than\r\nthe first movie (which many purists saw as a flaw), and conveyed where this\r\nseries could go with some talent and some effort. There was little reason to\r\nexpect such a horrendous drop in quality as there is to \u201cViral,\u201d a film that\r\ncontains some of the sloppiest, most ineffective filmmaking I\u2019ve seen all year.  Advertisement Even the wraparound segment doesn\u2019t make any sense. The\r\nfirst two films hinged on old VHS tapes discovered\r\nand then \u201cplayed\u201d for the audience: short films connected\r\nby a wraparound segment. The connective tissue this time is an obnoxious piece\r\nthat seems designed to play off the titular concept of virality in today\u2019s\r\nsocial media world but is just loud, poorly edited and remarkably annoying. You\r\nhave to dig to discern that \u201cV/H/S: Viral\u201d consists of short films with enough\r\nviral content to actually be deadly. Imagine someone screaming at you between\r\nshort films and you have some idea what\u2019s going on here.  Now, the idea that these are viral short films does give the\r\nfilmmakers a bit more freedom in terms of the general restrictions of the found\r\nfootage genre. However, that still\r\ndidn\u2019t excuse half of the \u201cwhy would someone be filming that\u201d choices that\r\nfollow. To say that \u201cV/H/S: Viral\u201d pushes the suspension of disbelief in terms\r\nof found footage would be an understatement. The \u201cZombie Go-Pro\u201d segment in \u201cV/H/S/2\u201d\r\nwas delightfully simple\u2014what if someone had a camera on their head during the\r\nundead apocalypse? All of the filmmakers here would have been well-advised to\r\nfollow that simple-is-better structure. The problems start with the first convoluted mess, \u201cDante\r\nthe Great,\u201d a piece about a magician (Justin Wellborn) who finds a magical cape\r\nand goes power mad with it. Everything about this segment fails. The acting is\r\nunconvincing, the structure is never consistent (are they making a documentary\r\nor is this hidden camera footage?), and the storytelling is unengaging. There\u2019s\r\nnot a single clever, interesting or memorable moment in it. The scariest thing\r\nabout it is that someone thought it was competent enough to be included in a\r\nmajor film. It needed rewrites, recasting, and another round of editing. And it\r\nprobably still wouldn\u2019t have worked. Advertisement The bafflingly low bar set by \u201cDante the Great\u201d makes Nacho\r\nVigalondo\u2019s \u201cParallel Monsters\u201d feel like an oasis in a horror desert. In it, a\r\nmad scientist in his basement opens a door to a parallel reality, where he sees\r\nan identical version of himself. The pair agrees to hop universes for 15\r\nminutes, look around, and come back. He QUICKLY learns that the external\r\nappearance of his doppelganger is the only thing that\u2019s the same on the other\r\nside of that door. This bit has a nice energy and the confidence brought to it\r\nby Vigalondo, but even it ends on a note of disappointment. In comparison to\r\nthe rest of the film, it\u2019s a masterpiece, but even it just misses what I think\r\nVigalondo intended by virtue of being largely one-joke. It\u2019s a good joke, but\r\nit\u2019s still just one joke. And then it\u2019s back into the pit with \u201cBonestorm,\u201d an aggressively\r\nloud and annoying piece about skateboarders who stumble on a cult looking for a\r\nsacrifice. There are only so many shots of skateboard kids slicing and dicing\r\ntheir enemies one can take before we\u2019ve crossed the line from film to something\r\nthat looks more like a video game. I take that back. Most video games are more\r\ncompetently made. Like a lot of horror fans, I'm both more forgiving and more critical of the genre. I know, from experience, that those who love horror movies will often overlook flaws simply because they so badly want their genre to become more respectable and critically acclaimed. Horror fans seek out under-the-radar gems, and embrace their genre's most creative voices. However, it also feels like that blind love for the horror genre can be abused by lazy filmmaking. I get angry when it feels like a fan base is being exploited because, well, \"they'll see it anyway because they liked the last one.\" We've seen this in countless bad horror sequels. And it's exactly what we're seeing here with \"V/H/S: Viral.\"", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Annabelle: Creation", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "It used to be a pretty reliable rule of moviedom that sequels to inferior horror films were even more worthless than the original. After all, how do you build on nothing? Last year\u2019s \u201cOuija: Origin of Evil\u201d was widely and correctly considered superior to the dull original, and 2017 repeats that shocking trick with \u201cAnnabelle: Creation,\u201d a vast improvement over the monstrously awful \u201cAnnabelle\u201d from 2014. Whereas that film felt like a quickie way to cash-in on the success of \u201cThe Conjuring,\u201d David F. Sandberg\u2019s follow-up doesn\u2019t feel focus-grouped to death or spawned purely for profit margins. It has echoes of the original film, and works more with mood and less with cheap scares than either \u201cAnnabelle\u201d or \u201cThe Conjuring 2,\u201d resulting in a truly effective genre flick. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s damn closer than anyone would have predicted. Advertisement While the title makes clear that this is an origin story for one of the creepiest dolls in film history, it also sets up its own characters and universe in which to play, one that echoes the construction and themes from James Wan\u2019s original film more than any of the works that have followed. Just as that box office hit centered on a group of sisters caught in a nightmare, \u201cAnnabelle: Creation\u201d is essentially a haunted house flick with another collection of young girls faced with things that go bump in the night. In this case, it\u2019s a group of orphans who are allowed to live in a large, isolated home when their orphanage closes. Led by Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman), the girls vary in age\u2014again, like the sisters in the original film\u2014but focus immediately falls on Janice (Taliha Bateman), weakened by polio, and her sweet best friend Linda (Lulu Wilson). Any good horror fan knows that evil always preys on the weak and kind first. And so it\u2019s Janice who first notices something isn\u2019t right in the Mullins house. Sure, Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) seems like a nice enough guy, but he\u2019s overly concerned about anyone going in his deceased daughter Bee\u2019s room. And Esther Mullins (Miranda Otto) is even more mysterious, injured, bed-ridden and ringing a bell whenever she needs her husband. The girls mostly stay to themselves, but Janice is the first to notice that Bee\u2019s locked room is open in the middle of the night, and then she finds that damned doll. Before you know it, souls are being fought over, lights are going out, and religious imagery is being subverted everywhere. These movies have several themes, but one of the most prominent is the utter failure of religion to protect us from true evil. Sandberg loves to cast light through crosses on windows and gets some incredible mileage in the final act with imagery that recalls the crucifixion. Yes, believe it or not, \u201cAnnabelle: Creation\u201d has what the first film was so clearly lacking: a strong visual language. Sandberg and his team do a marvelous job at building tension through old-fashioned horror movie means like forcing our perspective to stay with our terrified young ladies. As their eyes widen and the hair on their neck goes up regarding just what is making that creaking sound down the dark hallway, so does yours. Sandberg knows that fear manifests most greatly from the unknown and he has a ball playing with sound and light in \u201cCreation.\u201d Creaking chairs, footsteps when everyone should be asleep, that damn bell Mrs. Mullins rings\u2014all get used masterfully in the first half of the film.\u00a0 Advertisement Of course, we know all of these tricks. And Sandberg knows we know. Rarely have I seen a mainstream horror movie that riffs more playfully with the awareness of the modern horror audience. Sandberg knows that if he shows you an open door into a darkened room, your eyes are going to be planted on that darkness, searching the edges of the frame for movement, glowing eyes, whatever. If he puts Annabelle in the background, no one\u00a0is paying attention to the foreground. He has a blast with these constructions during the set-up parts of \"Annabelle: Creation.\" And then Sandberg and his team unleash the fury in the final half-hour of the film, constructing some of the best mainstream horror sequences of the last few years, including one in a barn that had the poor large gentleman next to me just whispering \u201cno, no, no.\u201d That\u2019s when you know a movie is really working. When it reduces grown men to single syllables. \u201cAnnabelle: Creation\u201d isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s a bit too long (109 minutes) and sometimes feels like it\u2019s making up its own story logic as it goes along. In that sense, it\u2019s more like a ghost story told around a campfire than a literal origin story\u2014a blend of religious imagery, grieving parents, weakened children, and otherworldly evil\u2014and that urban legend aspect could have allowed Sandberg and writer Gary Dauberman to lean into the insanity of their concept a bit more. The aforementioned barn sequence being a great example of when the movie knows to go crazy, but the movie often feels like it\u2019s pulling back from true risk-taking. It sometimes seems too restrained, believe it or not given it\u2019s about a possessed doll, and a few too many of the scariest scenes end ineffectively with jump scares that don\u2019t pay off like the great build-ups. But, again, it\u2019s more about what could be making that creaking sound in the hallway than the heavily made-up demon that\u2019s actually there.

{"Title": "Kiki", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In 1990, Madonna brought \"Voguing\"\u2014an exaggerated dance style started in the underground ballroom scene in Harlem\u2014to the mainstream with her mega-hit \"Vogue,\" a song that celebrates fantasy and escapism and beauty. Madonna hired dancers she had seen out in the New York club scene, and suddenly, that secret underground world of drag clubs and \"Harlem ballroom\" was on display at the MTV Awards and in the David Fincher-directed video of the song. That same year, \"Paris is Burning,\" Jennie Livingston's documentary about the Harlem dance club and drag scene, won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance. If anyone wondered where Madonna heard about \"voguing,\" the documentary was the answer. Now, 26 years later, comes Sara Jorden\u00f6\u2019s \"Kiki,\" another deep dive into the same scene. It's an intimate look at a marginalized community, many of whom rely on the various neighborhood clubs for support systems that don't exist anywhere else. The so-called \"Kiki\" scene is not just about the various competitive dance club contests. The scene provides a social structure, a \"net,\" for kids who have nowhere else to go. Advertisement Jorden\u00f6, a Swedish filmmaker, collaborated on the film with LGBTQ activist Twiggy Pucci Garcon (he gets a co-writing credit). Twiggy is a highly visible member of the ballroom scene, and his involvement was crucial in terms of providing Jorden\u00f6 access to a community that is highly protective (with good reason) of its members. The documentary has a high-energy and full-immersion style that thrusts you into the center of the various \"houses\" connected to the scene. Each \"house\" has a team that competes in the dance competitions. The dance competitors are mostly queer and trans people of color, and \"Kiki\" introduces you to many of them. \"Kiki,\" with all of its group scenes (kids Voguing on the Chelsea piersa common hangout, the raucous competitions themselves), is really a character-driven narrative. While there are similarities in many of their stories, each journey is different. Many of the young adults profiled have been kicked out of the house for being trans, queer, or just gender-nonconforming. They have gravitated towards one another, and immersed themselves in a culture that is nonjudgmental, open, and caring. They take care of each other. They crash on each other's couches. They have each other's collective backs. \"Paris is Burning\" highlighted the struggles of queer kids in the Reagan/Bush era, and \"Kiki\" shows the anxiety of the scene at the tail-end of the Obama years. Many of these people depend on federal funding. They are among the most vulnerable members of our society. They already experience an onslaught of harassment from family, peers, police. Many of them have fallen into addiction or sex work. There are support groups sponsored by each house, where people can talk openly about these issues. Twiggy is one of our main ways \"in\" to this closed scene, and you see him running warm-ups for rehearsals, and keeping everyone in line, reminding them of the stakes in the competitions. He is an activist, working for the homeless LGBT youths in his community, helping to provide structures of support and relief. Gia Marie Love emerges as the star of the film, however: a trans woman who has transformed herself from a bullied youth into a leader in her community. Watching her run a support group, it's not hard to understand why she was a debate club champion in high school. There's the soft-spoken Divo, kicked out of the house by his mother, who was\u2014as he admits freely\u2014saved by the ballroom scene. Advertisement One thing \"Kiki\" does really well is show how these dance competitions are an organizational structure for kids who might otherwise slip through the cracks. Everyone makes their own costumes, which are fantastical and outrageous. Taking place in school gyms and community halls, it's a safe space where people can let loose and express themselves, with no fear of harassment or rejection. This is a scene that takes care of its own. In many cases, it's literally life or death. Jorden\u00f6 makes a couple of directorial choices that repeat throughout: each person is seen standing on a city sidewalk, a pier, a street corner, staring directly at the camera, a vision of stillness that stops the film in its tracks, giving us a chance to breathe, to look. There are also a couple of scenes shot in an empty theatre, where the various dancers, bathed in blue light, show their stuff. It provides another perspective of these street kids, their ability to translate their fantasies of themselves into movement, elegant and elongated and exaggerated. The full-immersion style has its drawbacks. The characters are introduced early on, those the film will follow, but biographical details and \"confessional\" comments come late in the documentary. It takes a while to understand what is happening, and who is who. The jostle of names and information and intersecting relationships is a confusing bombardment.\u00a0 With music by Qween Beat, \"Kiki\" shows the new generation of the ballroom scene, their care for one another, their awareness of the struggles ahead, their determination to be themselves, against all odds. They are scared, but they are strong. They know what is right and they fight for it. \"Kiki,\" with all its rough glamour and rambunctious dancing, is a political film. These kids live it.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Stratton", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "This movie opens with a bunch of texts extolling the badassery of the \u201cSpecial Boat Service,\u201d a branch of Britain\u2019s Royal Navy. The text has a certain needling quality; were it to have wound up saying \u201cTrust us, it\u2019s really badass,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be a bit surprised. We see the problem here. Unlike \u201cNavy SEALS,\u201d which has an intriguing ring to it right off the bat, \u201cSpecial Boat Service\u201d sounds like something you\u2019d call if you need a particularly swanky water taxi. \u201cStratton,\u201d then, is titled for a particularly badass member of Special Boat Service. It is based on a book by Duncan Falconer, which yes, is a pen name,\u00a0apparently, for a person who was once in the Special Boat Service and has written one non-fiction book about it and a bunch of Stratton novels about it. This movie is directed by Simon West, who as many people are fond of recalling, also directed \u201cCon Air,\u201d the 1997 action thriller that has accrued something resembling classic status over the past two decades. Apparently \u201cCon Air\u201d is enough to get some people\u2019s hopes up every time a new film directed by Simon West comes around. This wannabe franchise opener does not fulfill any hope, however. Advertisement After explaining Special Boat Service, the movie chronicles Dominic Cooper\u2019s Stratton on a mission in the Persian Gulf, particularly Iran\u2019s Strait of Hormuz. The bearded operative is joined by American partner Marty, stealthily raiding a chemical weapons plant while their remote support team keeps track of them. I don\u2019t watch the television series \u201cScorpion\u201d regularly, honest I don\u2019t, but this opener feels like an episode of that show with the \u201cwacky\u201d characters excised. That is, a tense woman in front of a computer (Gemma Chan) instructs Stratton and Marty as the \u201ctension\u201d mounts and the inevitable cry of \u201cWe have no choice! Just send in the chopper!\u201d is sounded.    Back home on his lonesome, Stratton licks his wounds on his houseboat, from which his now ex-girlfriend has disembarked. No worries: he has an eccentric hard-drinking neighbor (Derek Jacobi) on a neighboring boat. I think these guys are standard issue for British intelligence agents. Back at the office, Stratton reports to female boss Sumner, whose authority is immediately undercut for the viewer on account of her being portrayed on an elliptical exercise machine when Stratton walks in. There\u2019s all sorts of bad news. The guy who led an armed attack on Stratton and the now-absent Marty is a long-thought-dead Russian operative with whom Sumner (poor Connie Nielsen) was once romantically involved. Also, there\u2019s a mole in the SBS offices, whose identity you\u2019ll guess as soon as the actor who plays him walks into a frame. And there\u2019s a terrorist attack in the offing. Target: they don\u2019t know yet. Oh, wait, a little while later they find out. Oh, no. It\u2019s London.    This really is a paint-by-numbers action movie with two good things going for it. Those are brevity\u2014it\u2019s only 93 minutes long\u2014and immediate forgetability. This latter quality, I allow, is only considered good by a certain class of people, those who feel overly beleaguered. Given that this is a movie reaching our screens in a time when people are just plain tired, and perhaps dreading the travails of the year ahead, an aggressively unimposing movie such as this might not be the worst time-waster. But it\u2019s still a time-waster.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "It's So Easy and Other Lies", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\u201cIt\u2019s So Easy and Other Lies\u201d is a TV special (or DVD extra) about Duff McKagan\u2019s live reading of his book of the same name, as accompanied by a band. It\u2019s not revealing or dense enough to really qualify as a feature doc, as evidenced by its remarkably brief running time and superficial retelling of complex chapters from McKagan\u2019s life. To call it a greatest hits version of the book wouldn\u2019t even really be accurate as the film can\u2019t stay focused on any chapter or anecdote long enough for them to resonate. And the movie has an undeniable black hole at its center in the fact that it barely mentions Axl Rose, and includes no original Guns N' Roses recordings (although the band does play instrumental versions of songs like \"Paradise City\" and \"Nighttrain\"). McKagan reads passages from his book and performs songs in front of an audience, and that serves as the foundation of \u201cIt\u2019s So Easy and Other Lies.\u201d I would have much rather just watched a concert film of that event than the documentary that Christopher Duddy tries to shape from it. Advertisement Of course, \u201cIt\u2019s So Easy and Other Lies\u201d opens with the word \u201cfuck\u201d and some guitar riffs. It kind of legally has to, right? As the personable and incredibly talented McKagan reads chapters from his book, Duddy intercuts them with old photos, footage of Duff riding around L.A., interviews and even animation. It\u2019s a cluttered approach that feels desperate to please and almost manic. For the next seventy minutes or so, this style rarely changes, as the film flits from subject to subject. We learn about when Duff met Slash. We hear about McKagan\u2019s early bands (some with names like Thankless Dogs, Cleavage and The Fartz). We get a bit about how Seattle drug culture was killing some of the biggest names in music. Although any music fan who sees \u201cAndrew Wood RIP\u201d followed by \u201cLayne Staley RIP\u201d and then hears the line from McKagan\u2019s book \u201cand the grunge thing didn\u2019t happen until like ten years later\u201d will know how haphazardly the film has been edited together (Wood died in \u201990, Staley in \u201902, grunge \u201chappened\u201d in between). It may sound like nitpicking but it\u2019s an example of how unfocused the movie can feel. There are also elements of McKagan\u2019s writing that are easily forgivable as we speed through the book but less so when read aloud. Lines like \u201cThe whole world is vibrating with anger from within \u2026 and, more ominously, from without\u201d don\u2019t do the production any favors. Most frustratingly, Duddy and McKagan SPEED through the Guns N' Roses years, probably because they knew its degree of difficulty without the actual music. About Axl Rose, we hear McKagan say \u201cI liked him right away,\u201d and then praise his voice, and that\u2019s about it. McKagan talks about hearing Axl scream for the first time, and we don\u2019t hear it. It made me want to pause the movie and go listen to Appetite for Destruction again (and I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t do that). The long history of the drama of GNR is well-recorded, but you can\u2019t really tell McKagan\u2019s story and treat it like a footnote. When someone says late in the film, \u201cWe could talk about McKagan a lot and not talk about Guns N' Roses,\u201d he\u2019s not quite right. And when the film focuses more on Velvet Revolver than GNR, it\u2019s impossible not to feel like the balance is off. 41 minutes into the film, McKagan starts actually singing\u2014\u201cKnockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door,\u201d one of two songs GNR recorded that they were allowed to use, and the other is also a cover, proving that original lyrics were clearly a no-no\u2014during a particularly rough flashback about when his pancreas exploded during a time when he was so deep in his addiction that he barely noticed at first. I would have watched a lot more of that. I imagine the live show, interspersing the readings and live music, is more powerful by having both. By reducing it to just a few lines from the book and editing in everything else, all of it is diminished: the music, the book, the true story. And when the movie essentially ends 30 minutes later (it\u2019s filled out to a more reasonable film running time with an actual musical performance\u2014\u201cYou Can\u2019t Put Your Arms Around a Memory,\u201d a New York Dolls cover that GNR did on \u201cThe Spaghetti Incident\u201d), we\u2019re left wondering what we\u2019ve learned. Duff McKagan is talented, smart and nice. He went through some deep shit with his addictions and came out stronger and happier, with a beautiful family. And he was in one of the best bands of all time. His story deserves a better movie. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Neither Heaven Nor Earth", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Cl\u00e9ment Cogitore\u2019s strong \u201cNeither Heaven Nor Earth\u201d reminds\r\none of \u201cL\u2019Avventura\u201d and \u201cAbout Elly\u201d in how those films use disappearance\r\nas a thematic tool more than an unsolved mystery demanding resolution.\r\nCogitore defines his setting well, focusing on the wind, sun and sand of\r\nAfghanistan 2014 as a French group of soldiers keep the fragile peace and\r\nplan for departure. It\u2019s a world that seems mostly harmless, but an early\r\nshoot-out with Taliban in the hills makes it clear that the potential for danger remains. It\u2019s\r\nin this unique setting, a place that inherently feels like purgatory for those\r\nstuck there, that Cogitore crafts a tense tale of faith and mystery.  Advertisement After an encounter with a man and his sheep who get too\r\nclose to their guard post, a pair of French soldiers in Afghanistan, well,\r\ndisappear. One night, they\u2019re watching figures on the horizon. The next\r\nmorning, they are simply gone. Satellite images of the area offer no insight.\r\nThe commander, a confident man named Antar\u00e8s (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier), is naturally\r\nconvinced that they were kidnapped by local opposing forces. Through a\r\ntranslator, he interrogates the denizens of a local village, but his men have\r\nsimply vanished off the face of the Earth. He orders everyone to keep their\r\ndisappearance secret until he can figure out what is going on. Then more men\r\ndisappear. In this rock-strewn middle of nowhere, a man partnered with\r\nanother soldier in a bunker steps outside to urinate. We watch him through the\r\ndoor, knowing that danger\u2014both physical and possibly supernatural\u2014lurks over\r\nthe horizon. Our movie-watching sensibility trains us to fear for his\r\nsafety. We\u2019re in the bunker, he\u2019s out in the dangerous world. He returns to the\r\nbunker and his fellow soldier is gone. This scene really sets the tone for \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d given it\u2019s unbroken nature\u2014we know no one could have come in\r\nand kidnapped this man\u2014and the way Cogitore smartly keeps us in the bunker,\r\nwhere something happens. Exactly what that something is starts to drive Antar\u00e8s\r\ncrazy. As fear starts to overtake the soldiers underneath him, this practical\r\nleader questions what he knows as true\u2014men don\u2019t just disappear. \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d is effective more as a study of fear and failed leadership\r\nthan it is as a horror movie. In fact, if it has a weakness it\u2019s that audiences\r\nexpecting it to build to something tenser or even terrifying will be\r\ndisappointed. It drags a bit around the hour mark when it needs to be building\r\ntension and/or deepening its thematic points. There\u2019s also an underdeveloped\r\nsubplot of sleep deprivation, in that everyone becomes convinced that sleep-time is when people are taken by whatever force is removing them from this barren\r\nlandscape. Terrified and sleep-deprived in a war-torn country? There are times\r\nwhen I wanted those feelings to register more primally and emotionally than\r\nCogitore seems interested in doing. Advertisement Most of the directorial flaws and arguably wasted\r\nopportunity of the final act of \u201cNeither Heaven Nor Earth\u201d are offset by the unshowy,\r\ngrounded way in which Renier grounds the film. A regular collaborator of the\r\nDardennes brothers (\u201cL\u2019Enfant,\u201d \u201cThe Kid with a Bike\u201d), Renier has the natural\r\ncharisma of a born leader that\u2019s fascinating to see undermined by the unique\r\nsituations he finds himself in. While Cogitore generally allows viewers to\r\nplay with the film\u2019s themes to whatever degree they desire (don\u2019t all men\r\ndisappear to some extent during war, for example), Renier has to play the reality\r\nof the situation, and does so admirably. It\u2019s his plight\u2014that of a man\r\ntrained to be rational but now faced with the irrational\u2014that keeps \u201cNeither\r\nHeaven Nor Earth\u201d moving.

Its synthetic\r\ntrappings notwithstanding\u2014the \u201cElectronic\u201d part\u2014EDM is dance music, just like\r\nBig Band Swing was, just like early rock and roll was, just like disco was. All\r\nmusics that were initially reviled, and to some extent (with the arguable\r\nexception of Big Band Swing) initially misunderstood by Hollywood.  Advertisement \u201cWe Are Your Friends,\u201d directed by Max Joseph, from a script\r\nby Joseph and Meaghan Oppenheimer (based on a story by producer Richard\r\nSilverman), makes a big deal out of \u201cgetting\u201d EDM. There\u2019s the sleek,\r\nvisual-format flexible manner of the filmmaking, which mixes graphic design\r\ntropes with animation and such for some of the movie\u2019s most engaging sequences.\r\nThere\u2019s a scene in which the protagonist, a fledgling EDM DJ named Cole Carter,\r\nexplains the science of EDM as he rocks a dance floor, elaborating on getting\r\nthe magic BPM (Beats Per Minute) count that makes the music control the dance\r\nfloor subjects, almost zombie-like in the grip of the pulsating bass. There\u2019s a\r\nlittle music-wonk name dropping, with a mentor DJ showing off a rare Buchla\r\nsynthesizer and comparing his possible prot\u00e9g\u00e9, unfavorably, to one Juan\r\nAtkins.  Joseph recently made a documentary about the EDM production\r\nteam/record label DFA, so he\u2019s got some genuine knowledge under his belt. And\r\nwhile EDM is an area of music in which my expertise doesn\u2019t extend far past\r\nthat of an interested dabbler/dilettante, the EDM soundtrack of this movie\r\nsounded pretty credible/hot to me. Too bad that the movie\u2019s character dynamics\r\nand plot are as cheesy as that of, oh, I dunno, \u201cDon\u2019t Knock The Rock.\u201d How\u2019s\r\nthis for clich\u00e9: talented, eager, but unseasoned DJ gets taken under the wing\r\nof older, popular, but jaded and close-to-washed-up genre star, who shows him\r\nthe ropes, opens his ears, and who also happens to\u2026wait for it\u2026have a gorgeous\r\ngirlfriend with whom Mr. Talented And Eager gets entangled in a bad way. Yeah,\r\nthat kind of plot.  What\u2019s worse is that said DJ, Cole Carter, comes complete\r\nwith a contingent of San Fernando Valley tatted BroDouche pals, kind of out of\r\nthe \u201cDiner\u201d handbook but even more belligerent, clueless, and sexist. And minus\r\nany charm. There\u2019s super-brash Mason (Jonny Weston), self-proclaimed \u201cmovie\r\nstar\u201d Ollie (Shiloh Fernandez), and Squirrel (Alex Shaffer). In the event you\r\nhaven\u2019t guessed, Squirrel is the shy, sensitive one.  As for Cole, he\u2019s played by Zac Efron, getting a tad edgier\r\nafter \u201cNeighbors.\u201d I had, a few months ago, come upon a bit of misinformation:\r\nI read somewhere that Zach Braff was playing the role of the EDM DJ in this\r\nmovie. I had a great observation prepared, something along the lines of,\u00a0 \u201cZach Braff trying to pass himself off as a\r\nguy who\u2019s even HEARD any EDM, let alone an EDM DJ, is about as plausible as\r\nBruce Hornsby jamming with The Melvins.\u201d But, as I said, I was misinformed.  Advertisement Efron, however, often looks nearly at sea as Braff would\r\nhave. Part of it has to do with his character being a bit of a cipher to begin\r\nwith. His mentor-girlfriend triangle, while entirely rote and predictable in\r\nmost of its particulars, also constitutes one of the more watchable overall\r\nportions of the movie (the stuff with Cole and his pals is very nearly\r\ninsufferable, and the detour these career-challenged millennials take with a\r\ncoarse real estate vulture in a subplot constitutes several varieties of\r\nnadir), because the mentor DJ is played by Wes Bentley, who brings a humming\r\nundercurrent of sardonicism to his role, and the assistant/girlfriend is played\r\nby Emily Ratajkowski who is just\u2026delightful to look upon. A scene at a Vegas DJ\r\nfest wherein her character gives Cole a tab of Ecstasy, or whatever it is, and\r\nthey \u201croll\u201d together made me wish I was a much younger man, a man with hair,\r\nand a tolerance for recreational drugs. I should say ALMOST made me wish, as I\r\nhappen to be happily married to a beautiful woman who doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m\r\nbald. I should also mention that aside from having Major Presence, Ratajkowski\r\nnavigates her character\u2019s three crucial (actually only) nodes, Sweet, Sexy, and\r\nSensible, very well.  But I digress. Lest the viewer come to the conclusion that\r\nthis movie\u2019s portrayal of the EDM drug culture is too cavalier, there does kick\r\nin near the end a Cautionary Tale Plot Point, which is arbitrary to the point\r\nof insulting.

As is often the case with films that crib from the horror-comedy\r\nmasters like Peter Jackson, the balance is tougher to pull off than it first\r\nappears, and \u201cDeathgasm\u201d gets a bit numbing and repetitive before it\u2019s over,\r\nbut there\u2019s enough fun, clever material here for metalheads and horror fans to\r\nlike until Sean Byrne\u2019s superior \u201cThe Devil Candy\u201d (a TIFF hit that also plays\r\nwith that elusive dynamic between metal and Satan) lands sometime next year. Advertisement Brodie (the natural Milo Cawthorne) has just moved to a\r\nmiserable new town, one in which he clearly doesn\u2019t belong. Staying with his\r\nultra-religious aunt and uncle, Brodie wears his metalhead status like a crown,\r\nrefusing to give into bullies like his cousin or the perceived suburban norm.\r\nAfter a few false starts of friendship with other social misfits who have\r\nsuffered similar bully abuse, Brodie finally thinks he\u2019s found a soulmate in Zakk\r\n(James Blake) another guy who paints his face and rocks out. Brodie also notices\r\nthe prettiest girl at school, the charming Medina (Kimberley Crossman), and\r\nfalls hard, even though she\u2019s dating his jock cousin. After being bullied one\r\ntoo many times and failing to win the heart of the blonde lass, Brodie plays a\r\nsong with his new band, DEATHGASM (all caps, of course), and inadvertently brings\r\nforth a demon force known as The Blind One, instantly plunging their normal\r\ncorner of the world into bloody chaos. Can the rockers survive the end of the\r\nworld? I do mean instantly.\r\nOne of the more admirable elements of \u201cDeathgasm\u201d is how little time Howden\r\nwastes once the demonic viscera hits the fan. This is not a slow burn\u2014it\u2019s an\r\norgy of crazy violence and impressive make-up effects. Before the guys know it,\r\neveryone around them has been possessed by something that looks like what Ash\r\nlocked in the basement in \u201cEvil Dead 2.\u201d The summoning song is played and\r\nsuddenly people are puking blood and faces are getting power-sanded. Through it\r\nall, Howden keeps an admirable, Jackson-esque levity in the film that works\r\nmore often than it falters. Dialogue like, \u201cIt\u2019s\r\nweird, but I think he would have wanted to go out like this,\u201d after a\r\nparticularly brutal death keep things from getting overly gross and repulsively gory for a while\r\n(I also particularly enjoyed a bad guy ordering someone be decapitated a second\r\ntime to confused looks of his minions). However, gorehounds need not worry that a movie called \u201cDeathgasm\u201d\r\nplays it safe. This is a defiantly, well, metal movie. From a possessed human\r\nbeing bludgeoned with a sex toy to a guy whose head and spine are literally\r\nripped from his body, there are a number of opportunities for the film\u2019s\r\nfanbase to give devil horns to the screen. At its best, it\u2019s like a Megadeth\r\nalbum cover sprung to life. The only problems come, as they often do in films\r\nlike this, in the pacing department. To be honest, it\u2019s another trait shared\r\nwith metal in that a lot of heavy albums get numbing and exhausting around the\r\n2/3rds mark. That\u2019s about when I was ready for \u201cDeathgasm\u201d to finish up its\r\nencore.  Advertisement Howden\u2019s debut is helped greatly by his cast, especially\r\nCawthorne and Crossman, a cute couple who go well beyond \u201cdork\u201d and \u201cpopular\r\ngirl\u201d to ground their characters in ways that horror often misses. The director\r\nand his stars commit to the insanity of their project.

{"Title": "The Scribbler", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "With narrative echoes of \u201cSucker Punch\u201d and stylistic\r\ncommonalities with \u201cSin City,\u201d one would expect John Suits\u2019 \u201cThe Scribbler,\u201d\r\nadapted by graphic novelist Dan Schaffer, to at least be a bit of escapist fun.\r\nA female empowerment, mental illness-defeating, noir-esque comic book movie\r\nwith B-movie Goddesses like Gina Gershon, Sasha Grey and Eliza Dushku? Where do\r\nI buy tickets? And yet \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d never clicks into the escapist mind f**k\r\nit really needed to be to work. It can't maintain its style and never finds its substance. It\u2019s a ridiculous narrative with scenery-chewing\r\nperformances, but it doesn\u2019t have the form to match. It\u2019s dull when one wants\r\nit to be ludicrous, and serves as a reminder of how hard it is to bring comic books to celluloid life on a limited budget. Advertisement Suki (Katie Cassidy) has multiple personalities, one of\r\nwhich is the title character. Her Doctor (Billy Campbell) has developed a\r\ntechnique known as \u201cThe Siamese Burn,\u201d which is essentially a massive shock to\r\nthe system designed to destroy the extraneous personalities one at a time. But\r\nwhich ones are extraneous? And what will she do when she\u2019s down to two?\r\nQuestions like these linger in the background of what is also a poorly-written\r\nmystery. The \u201cBurn\u201d subplot is actually part of a flashback conveyed through an\r\ninvestigation by two police officers (Eliza Dushku, Michael Imperioli) into why\r\nall of Suki\u2019s fellow inhabitants of Juniper Tower happen to be showing up dead.\r\nThe Tower is a halfway house for the \u201cmentally and socially inept,\u201d which\r\nallows for a cavalcade of odd characters, including a bunny ear-wearing Sasha\r\nGrey, milk bath-taking Gina Gershon, disturbing Michelle Trachtenberg,\r\nscene-stealing Garret Dillahunt and a girl who just walks around naked (Ashlynn\r\nYennie). One by one, most of these characters jump from Juniper Tower, leading\r\none to wonder if \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d doesn\u2019t have echoes of \u201cIdentity\u201d as well and\r\nthese people are all just dying personalities of the film\u2019s protagonist. The best moments of \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d embrace the film\u2019s\r\nridiculous concept with overheated dialogue pulled from the noir/action comic\r\nbook manual. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what happened, from the beginning?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s\r\nnot always the best way to tell a story.\u201d Those lines early in Schaffer\u2019s film\r\nsets it up as a work that will navigate the traditional storytelling structure\r\nin a unique manner, but \u201cThe Scribbler\u201d ends up depressingly linear.

{"Title": "Obvious Child", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Writer-director Gillian Robespierre's \"Obvious Child\" arrives with the buzz of Sundance behind it, and the unfortunate buzz of being billed as the first \"abortion comedy.\" Those words are a bit misleading. \"Obvious Child\" is definitely a comedy, and it also deals with abortion. But the approach is not glib or casual. It's a film that is really about the behavior of its main characters, the rhythms of conversations, the unexpected moments that surprise, and the sudden flashes of feeling that act as an ambush. It's a whirlwind. It touches on themes of arrested development, needing to grow up and to accept responsibility for who you are (both onstage and off, the film being about a standup comedian who uses her own life story in her act), but \"Obvious Child\" is not ponderous with these themes. Advertisement \"Obvious Child\" starts in a small stand-up club in Brooklyn, the kind of place with seven or eight tables and a unisex bathroom covered in graffiti. The comics who show up all have bigger dreams, they have agents, they just sold a pilot. The film opens with Donna (Jenny Slate) on-stage, in the midst of doing a set, one that is immediately disarming, honest and legitimately funny. It feels unscripted. It's a bit of a mess. Her delivery is spontaneous, even down to moments where she loses track of what she is saying and has to find her way back to the joke. She gets an enthusiastic response from the audience. But her boyfriend, smoldering in the back, feels differently about being used as a prop in her comedy, and breaks up with her. The breakup scene is when I first sensed that \"Obvious Child\" was working on a unique wavelength. She is truly crushed at the turn of events. Donna is not just a wise-cracking broad, using her comedy to keep people at bay, or joke her way out of living a serious life (although that is part of it). Comedy is not pathologized here, although the impulse to get up and talk about your life in front of others is examined in interesting ways. Donna is vulnerable and that vulnerability is part of her act. The concept of using one's life as fodder for your art is an underlying motif of \"Obvious Child,\" and it comes back again and again, seen through different angles of the prism. Sometimes Donna hits it out of the park. Other times, like when she goes on-stage wasted, in the wake of the breakup, and rambles on incessantly to an increasingly embarrassed audience, she falls flat on her face. Donna is almost thirty, and still babied by her parents (Richard Kind and Polly Draper), she is a clerk in a bookstore called \"Unoppressive Non-Imperialst Books,\" and lives with her roommate Nellie (an excellent Gaby Hoffman). One drunken night at the club, she goes home with a guy named Max (Jake Lacy), who is not a comedian, is in business school, and seems taken with Donna's aggressive brand of conversation (despite the fact that he also has a hard time keeping up with it). They cavort around. They laugh. They have sex. It's all a part of her breakup tailspin. Advertisement When she finds herself pregnant a couple of weeks later, she doesn't know what the hell to do. Max keeps showing up in her life. He seems to want to go on dates now. Should she tell him he got her pregnant? She barely knows him. Unlike in Judd Apatow's \"Knocked Up,\" with a similar circumstance and where abortion is not even mentioned by name (except for the cowardly \"schma-shmortion\"), \"Obvious Child\" is honest. There are moments of gallows humor. There are moments of deep pain and struggle. There's one great scene when Donna is in the back of a cab, and she decides to go talk to her mother so she asks the cab driver if he can turn around and go back to Manhattan. His response is rude, albeit in a cursory way, and yet she is so lost and scared that she dissolves into sobs in the back seat. Slate manages to give us a character who has walls and a certain persona, and yet that persona constantly cracks. It's part of her act; it's part of what she \"uses\" for comedy. Her emotions come up against her will. When she is able to harness them, she is funny and even charming. When they get the better of her, she goes down with the ship. You can understand why Donna has loyal friends who put up with all of that. And it's also completely plausible that Max enjoys her so much. He's a subtext kind of guy. He listens to what isn't being said. He is not completely overrun by the onslaught of her wisecracks, and sometimes gives as good as he gets. He is taken aback by her dirty jokes, but isn't judgmental. \"On the page,\" Max may seem like a cliche. But as portrayed by Lacy, he feels like a real guy, someone you've met, someone you know. There are a couple of coincidences in the script that feel artificial, and there's a bit too much reliance on second-unit shots of Manhattan landscapes to get us from one scene to the next. But what is interesting here is the behavior, the subtext coursing beneath the text, the feeling that what comes up for these people is too big to be controlled, and yet they still try to control it. Romantic films, even good ones, often operate from cliche. \"Obvious Child\", an extremely self-aware film, acknowledges those cliches, and yet provides the characters a larger and more chaotic space to be themselves. The film is not anti-romantic. In many ways, it is extremely romantic. Watch Donna's reaction to when Max warms up the butter packets with his hands before giving them to her. It is an automatic gesture on his part, casual, and yet it says everything. She is nearly undone by the moment. \"Obvious Child\" is Robespierre's first feature, and it is an incredibly confident debut. Watching all of these people listen, talk, behave, react, think, work stuff out\u2026that's the genius of \"Obvious Child,\" that's the strength and beauty of its unique wavelength.

{"Title": "Escape from Tomorrow", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "As a movie, \"Escape from Tomorrow\" is a dark, weird, smutty, fitfully amusing comedy that ultimately wears out its welcome. As a provocation, it's aces, especially if\u2014like the film's writer-director, Randy Moore\u2014you hate Disney and everything it stands for.\u00a0 To be clear, I don't hate Disney. In fact I love a good number of the company's films, am fascinated by the history of its theme parks, and own books about the company's founder, Walt Disney. But I'm also a father of two who's visited Disney World on days when I was in a foul mood but had to suck it up and pretend to have a great time. That beleaguered side of me reacted to \"Escape from Tomorrow\" with cathartic glee.\u00a0This\u00a0low-budget black-and-white comedy about a husband and father going mad at Disney World\u00a0is clearly the work of a filmmaker wrestling with demons. It was shot on location in Disney World without permits. Judging from what's onscreen, that was the only way it could have been done: if Disney had known what the cast and crew were up to, they'd never have allowed them anywhere near the parks. \"Escape from Tomorrow\" is an act of cultural vandalism, the feature film equivalent of drawing genitals on cute storybook animals. \u00a0 Advertisement Roy Abramsohn stars as Jim, the beleaguered husband of Emily (Elena Schuber) and father to two small children, Sara (Katelynn Rodriguez) and Eliot (Jack Dalton). He already seems distracted or dissatisfied when we meet him, but the sudden news that he's been fired from his job pushes him over the brink. Something inside of him snaps. He behaves with impatience and then bitter anger toward his wife and kids, develops a pathetic sexual obsession with two beautiful teenage girls (Annet Mahendru and Danielle Safady), and hallucinates sinister visions on harmless rides. The latter include a visit to Disney's \"It's a Small World After All\" that transforms the chirpy, one-world puppet show into a psychedelic nightmare. As Jim, Abramsohn has a bit of the beaten-down schlub quality that Matthew Broderick brought to the hero in \"Election.\" He doesn't sugarcoat the character's unlikable qualities; he puts the desperation front-and-center, and makes sure that Roy owns all of his thoughts, including the sleazy and revolting ones. Moore's themes and vision are too narrow to support a feature-length comedy. It's fine that we never leave Jim's perspective, and that the whole story is shaped, at times deformed, by his mix of despair, lust and resentment; many great movies have stayed anchored to one character's point-of-view. The problem is that Jim's psyche isn't fascinating enough to wallow in for 90 minutes, and the supporting characters offer no relief from the monotony of his distress; they aren't written to suggest that there's more to them than what Jim sees\u2014and that's too bad, because whenever there's a gap between a lead character's perception of reality and reality, it enriches the story. The movie's teenage girls never seem like more than dirty-old-man fantasies, Lolitas skipping and laughing and teasing him. Emily is rarely more than a suffering spouse or a griping shrew (except in a marvelous late scene where she senses the depth of his misery and reaches out to him). We sometimes feel that Jim is not just projecting his pain onto undeserving proxies\u2014that maybe these rhymes-with-witches are his real problem.\u00a0 The movie's wild and disturbing climax redeems some of the movie's missteps. It unleashes the moviemaker's id by way of Jim's flipped-out imagination, and suggests he's right to think that the Mouse has a sinister agenda. There's a sense of missed opportunity at the end: \"Escape from Tomorrow\" could have been a sneaky masterpiece, and it isn't. But it's still a\u00a0vital and significant American feature; all movies should be this \"disappointing.\" \u00a0With its sneaky production history and low-tech special effects (including green-screened backgrounds a couple steps up from a karaoke video), \"Escape from Tomorrow\" is guerrilla art. It lashes out against the placid, sexless, clean-scrubbed version of happiness peddled by Disney, not because it thinks sanitized diversions have no place in American life, but because the Disney vision is as blandly oppressive as Nurse Ratched in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\"\u00a0 Advertisement \"Escape from Tomorrow\" screened at Sundance and EbertFest earlier this year. It got good critical notices and a lot of sight-unseen support, mostly from filmmakers who resented the way that media corporations squash art that tries to comment on their world view, their characters or their corporate history. Some assumed the movie would never get a proper theatrical release.  That Moore's film did, in fact, see the light of day suggests a sea change in media corporations' sense of what the phrase \"Fair Use\" means, and what level of bullying they can get away with. Maybe Disney's lawyers realized it's not appropriate to try to silence a comedy because it dares to treat Disney World and its copyrighted rides and characters as one might treat any other iconic site that families visit, such as the Washington mall or Times Square. To insist otherwise might have invited a legal battle\u2014one that Disney would have lost, once the jury realized that \"Escape from Tomorrow\" was a political as well as an artistic statement, and that the decision to shoot on location was essential to its mood and message.\u00a0 This is a small film set in small world, but its audacity makes it important. It feels like the first salvo in an intellectual property war. The enemy was wise not to shoot back.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Autopsy of Jane Doe", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "A very good year for horror films has one more scary story to haunt your dreams, the effective and creepy \u201cThe Autopsy of Jane Doe.\u201d Like many of the great horror films of 2016, Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal\u2019s thriller marries its concept to solid, character-driven work from the film\u2019s leads. As horror has become one of the best ways for indie filmmakers to tell personal stories, the emphasis on performance has gone up, leading to great acting turns in films like \u201cThe Witch,\u201d \u201cI Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe,\u201d among others. The concept of \u201cThe Autopsy of Jane Doe\u201d would make for a great ghost story around the campfire, but it\u2019s the dedicated work by Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox to ground the flick that makes it truly effective. Advertisement The actors play a father and son who work at one of the most inherently creepy places one could work: a morgue. The opening scenes beautifully set the tone. The two men are playful with each other, but it\u2019s clear that the elder is the knowledgeable one, and his kid is new to the game. Fans of shows like \u201cForensic Files\u201d and \u201cAutopsy\u201d will immediately take to the idea that these two can read a story from a body.  So what story is Jane Doe going to tell them? The film actually opens in one of its only scenes outside of the morgue, as the cops investigate a house full of brutally murder bodies. There\u2019s a dead family in pieces everywhere, but the weirdest thing they find is the naked woman half-buried in the basement. While everyone else is a bloody mess, she doesn\u2019t have a scratch on her. How did she die? Who is she? She ends up on our coroners\u2019 table and starts to tell her story. Internally, she\u2019s an absolute disaster. It looks like she was bound and tortured before she died. Her tongue was cut out. She was burned at some point. But her exterior remains intact. Spotless even. And then things start to get really weird. The director of the cult hit \u201cTroll Hunter\u201d works wonders in the fantastic first hour. He sets up some beautifully realized devices, such as when Cox explains how they used to tie a bell to dead bodies just to make sure they were actually dead instead of in a coma. Any horror fan will laugh, as we\u2019re all well aware that a tinkling bell will play a creepy role about 30 minutes later. It\u2019s a wonderful device, like when a haunted house movie lets us see the creaking door during daylight before it creaks on its own at night. And the first and second act here have a wonderful set-up/pay-off structure to them. As we start to figure out who Jane Doe is, the tension rises and the creepiness increases. \u201cThe Autopsy of Jane Doe\u201d is basically a great haunted house movie\u2014the house just happens to be the morgue. And, again, one can\u2019t undervalue having two strong actors like Hirsch and Cox to sell what this movie is trying to sell. They make the unbelievable feel genuinely terrifying.  This holds true for about an hour of the 86-minute running time and then \u201cJane Doe\u201d turns up the crazy factor and races to a conclusion that doesn\u2019t allow much for character or logic. It\u2019s not uncommon for a horror movie to be more effective in its set-up than its climax. A whispered boo is much scarier than a scream in your face. Luckily, that first hour of \u201cThe Autopsy of Jane Doe\u201d is so clever and well-done that it makes the sins of the finale easy to forgive.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Ivory Tower", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Ivory Tower\" raises a number of fascinating questions and offers numerous facts on the current, deeply flawed state of the American system of higher education but suffers from a lack of focus or even a hint of what we do about the situation. In fact, there are at least three sections of \"Ivory Tower\" that could be branched out into their own, more satisfying standalone documentaries, including profiles of the UnCollege Movement, the recent events at the Cooper Union, and the lessons learned in the relationship between San Jose State University and the online learning company Udacity. There\u2019s enough interesting, raw material in \"Ivory Tower\" to consider but one wishes it was shaped into something more cohesive and pointed in its attack and approach. Advertisement Is college overrated? For so much of American history, college has been sold as the key to the future. More and more, it\u2019s a key that\u2019s coming with baggage, including thousands of dollars in student loans. Competition for prestige among high-profile universities has led to rampant expansion. More programs means more facilities, means more students, means more attention, and so on. And all of it means more tuition. The cost of an education has increased more quickly in the past few decades than any other good or service. And as federal money has been taken away from our country\u2019s education, the loan movement has begun to resemble the subprime housing crisis, giving people debt that their children will have to repay. Worst of all, no one is sufficiently asking what our increasingly in-debt kids are getting for their high-APR loans. Someone should. And \"Ivory Tower\" serves as a way to start the conversation about why education is seen as a financial privilege instead of a right for all who need it or are willing to work for it. Half of our college-educated people in this country under 25 are underemployed or unemployed, with debt that is increasing at rates that should be illegal. Something has to be done. It\u2019s understandable that \"Ivory Tower\" director Andrew Rossi isn\u2019t certain what that \"something\" is but his unfocused approach for at least the first half of his documentary is downright jarring. Stats fly across the screen like the fact that 68% of the students who are paying small fortunes for their education at public universities won\u2019t graduate within four years. And then we\u2019ve moved on before that stat or its impact is placed in context. The film jumps from the impact of Harvard on the education system as a whole to the party school atmosphere at Arizona State University to the interesting story of Deep Springs College, without spending enough time on any of these stories to give them resonance. Until Cooper Union. If you don\u2019t know the story, Cooper Union is a Manhattan college that was founded on the radical model of free education and continued to provide tuition-free learning for decades. Until recently. When a new President, Jamshed Bharucha, came to the conclusion that the school could no longer survive without charging students to learn there, chaos ensued. Critics pointed to the debt amassed by the construction of a very expensive new building on campus and the $700k+ salary of their new leader, and students did what so many critics of millennials claim they are incapable of doing: they staged a revolution. They protested in the form of a sit-in in the President\u2019s office. This chapter of \"Ivory Tower\" is easily its strongest, and could have served as the whole documentary, seeing as it is really the culmination of so many issues in our educational crisis today. Advertisement I had similar feelings about later chapters on the UnCollege movement\u2014a San Francisco-based community of people who are trying to use so many of the tools now available to young people to learn without academia\u2014and the fascinating story of Udacity, one that reminds us of the value of traditional education.  Perhaps Rossi places the Udacity saga near the final act of \"Ivory Tower\" to circle back to the beginning. \"Well, the Harvard model may not be working, but we haven\u2019t found a better one.\" If the message of \"Ivory Tower\" is that we have to accept our broken system, it\u2019s a hard one to take (especially for this father of three). The crucial question that \"Ivory Tower\" fails to ask is the most important one of all: What do we do now?", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Gravity", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's \"Gravity,\" about astronauts coping with disaster, is a huge and technically dazzling film. Watching Sandra Bullock and George Clooney's spacefarers go about their business, you may feel\u2014for the first time since \"The Right Stuff,\" perhaps\u2014that a Hollywood blockbuster grasps the essence of \u00a0a job that many can't imagine without feeling dizzy.\u00a0The panoramas of astronauts tumbling against starfields and floating through space stations are both informative and lovely.\u00a0 But the most surprising and impressive thing about \"Gravity\" isn't its scale, its suspense, or its sense of wonder; it's that, in its heart, it is not primarily a film about astronauts, or space, or even a specific catastrophe. At times it plays like a high-tech version of shipwreck or wilderness survival story that happens to take place among the stars, and that would fit nicely on a double-bill alongside \"Deliverance,\" \"127 Hours,\" \"Cast Away,\" \"Rescue Dawn\" or the upcoming \"All Is Lost.\"\u00a0For all its stunning exteriors, it's really concerned with emotional interiors, and it goes about exploring them with simplicity and directness, letting the actors's faces and voices carry the burden of meaning. \u00a0It's a film about what happens to the psyche as well as the body in the aftermath of catastrophe. \u00a0 Advertisement Not content to observe the agonizing physical details of the astronauts' struggles, \"Gravity\" goes deep into the feelings \u00a0of one character, Bullock's Dr. Ryan Stone, a first-time space traveller who boards a shuttle alongside Clooney's Matt Kowalski to repair the Hubble telescope. When debris destroys the telescope and their ride home, Ryan finds herself marooned in orbit alongside Kowalski, taking an unasked-for crash course in disaster management, learning all she can from her more experienced partner, struggling to control the anxious heartbeat that flutters on the soundtrack along with her shallow breathing and the sporadic hiss of backpack thruster jets.\u00a0 \"Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission,\" Kowalski tells mission control (voiced, in one of Cuar\u00f3n's only film-buffish in-jokes, by Ed Harris, a veteran of both\u00a0\"The Right Stuff\" and \"Apollo 13\"). We hear Kowalski speak this line for the first of many times during the majestic opening shot. We see space, and Earth\u2014and beyond it, a tiny speck that slowly draws close, revealing the mission, the vehicles, the characters.\u00a0 In the hands of lesser storytellers, this shot and other, equally striking ones might play like showboating. (The filmmaker and his regular cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, shot numerous films with spectacular long takes, including \"Children of Men.\") Luckily,\u00a0Cuar\u00f3n, who cowrote the script with his eldest son Jon\u00e1s, roots every moment in a tactile present. The fragility of the body has rarely been spotlit so harshly, throughout the entire running time of a feature. Every time the astronauts move, or don't move, you worry they're going to end up like their colleagues: bodies frozen hard as bricks, faces caved in like pumpkins. Ryan is our stand-in. The movie makes this notion plain by shifting between points-of-view within unbroken long takes. A lot of the time we're in what you might call third person limited, watching Ryan and Kowalski move through their treacherous environment and taking note of objects drifting with them, some menacing, others oddly poignant: a chess piece, a ballpoint pen, a Marvin the Martian doll, a puff of electrical flame, a lone teardrop. But then, gradually, subtly, \"Gravity\" will morph into first person, drifting towards Ryan and then seeming to pass through her helmet, edging closer to her face, then finally pivoting so that we're gazing out through her visor, hearing her voice and breath echo inside her suit as she looks for a space station, for Kowalski; for someone, something, anything to grab onto. Advertisement Some have already complained that \"Gravity\" is too melodramatic, too simplistic, too mystical, too something; that once we figure out that it's about the psychology of Ryan, we may write it off as less imaginative than we hoped. \u00a0I don't believe such shortcomings\u2014if indeed they are shortcomings\u2014can dent this film's awesomeness. If \"Gravity\" were half as good as I think it is, I'd still consider it one of the great moviegoing experiences of my life, thanks to the precision and beauty of its filmmaking.\u00a0 But even if we grant that the movie doesn't have the philosophical ambition of \"2001\", the space adventure to which it's most often compared, fairness demands we recognize that it's trying for something else. \"Gravity\" is reminiscent of \"2001\" mainly because it feels like a feature-length expansion of the sequence in which astronaut Dave Bowman gets locked out of the Jupiter spacecraft without his helmet. Beyond that, it's its own thing, and its storytelling is as simple as its visuals are complex. A surprising number of scenes are theatrically spare: just people talking to each other, telling stories, painting mental pictures for us.\u00a0 For long stretches, Cuar\u00f3n trusts Bullock to give us a one-woman show, and she delivers. Her work here constitutes one of the greatest physical performances I've seen, and she's framed in ways that make each moment resonate. The way she twists and turns and swims through zero gravity is a master class in how to suggest interior states with gestures. An image of Ryan curled up womblike in zero gravity packs a primordial wallop: it's a dream image dredged from the Jungian muck. Some of the shots of Bullock's face through her helmet visor evoke Carl Dreyer's \"The Passion of Joan of Arc,\" the film that perfected the emotionally expressive closeup. \"Gravity\" evokes that silent classic and others\u2014including Maya Deren's experimental short \"Meshes of the Afternoon,\" whose most analyzed sequence, a series of shots boiling evolution down to four gestures, might have influenced the unabashedly metaphorical closing scene of\u00a0\u00a0Cuar\u00f3n's movie. Advertisement If anyone asks me what \"Gravity\" is about, I'll tell them it's a tense adventure about a space mission gone wrong, but once they've seen and absorbed the movie, they'll know the truth. The root word of \"Gravity\" is \"grave.\" That's an adjective meaning weighty or glum or substantial, but it's also a noun: the place where we'll all end up eventually. The film is about that moment when you suffered misfortune that seemed unendurable and believed all hope was lost and that you might as well curl up and die, and then you didn't. Why did you decide to keep going? It's is a mystery as great as any in physics or astronomy, and one we've all grappled with, and transcended.", "Critic": "Delta"}

Ceylan invokes/evokes Chekhov in his\r\nscenario: protagonist Aydin, an aging former theatrical actor, runs a hotel in\r\na picturesque section of Anatolia and desultorily deals with surly tenants on\r\nsome land he owns, a disenchanted (and much younger) wife, a watchful sister,\r\nand various others, revealing the discontents at the roots of all their\r\nrelationship and a deep dissatisfaction with life itself, despite the prestige\r\nand autonomy and leisure that Aydin enjoys.  The movie, which won the Palme d\u2019Or at this year\u2019s Cannes\r\nFilm Festival, has been disparaged by some skeptical critics as a gabfest, and\r\nit\u2019s true, there\u2019s a lot of talk here, and very little of it\u2019s small. But\r\nthat\u2019s not to say that the film is glacially paced; even when staying in the\r\nsame settings, Ceylan\u2019s camerawork and editing are terrifically alert. The\r\ntalk, for all its abstractions, gradually lays bare the poor regard with which\r\nmost of the characters hold each other, and, at about the halfway point, when\r\nAydin (played with glum tenacity by Haluk Bilginer) calls his put-upon spouse\r\n(Melisa S\u00f6zen) a \u201cbored neurotic,\u201d the fur really begins to fly. Not much of\r\nwhat is said by these characters is particularly novel or earth-shaking it\u2019s\r\ntrue, but I think that\u2019s central to what Ceylan is doing here. This is a work\r\nof cinema, not theater or prose, and what counts most in \u201cWinter Sleep,\u201d to me\r\nat least, is not the commonplace sentiments of dysfunction and dread, but\r\nspaces between the words. The accumulation of images imbues the film with a\r\nkind of bleak coziness that brings to life the accusation that Aydin\u2019s sister\r\nNecia (Demet Akbag) levels at him: \u201cIn order not to suffer, you prefer to fool\r\nyourself.\u201d The strength of \u201cWinter Sleep\u201d is not so much in what any of\r\nthe characters say as much as what it needs its near-monumental length to\r\nactually show: which is the way the most seemingly banal circumstances can\r\nthrow you into a dark night of the soul before you even know what\u2019s going on, a\r\nstate of wide-awake despair so calamitous one has no choice but to make a\r\ncompanion of it. That sounds like a paradoxical state\u2014and it is, a painfully\r\nparadoxical one, but it\u2019s a real one, and the signal accomplishment of \u201cWinter\r\nSleep\u201d is that Ceylan\u2019s empathy and technical facility make it palpable in the\r\nartistic realm. It\u2019s a daunting achievement and in a strange way also a\r\ncomfort. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}

The movie, directed by Shawn Christensen from a script he co-wrote with Jason Dolan, begins by signaling the precocious literary brilliance of the title character, played by Logan Lerman in \u201cthe twerp is father to the bro\u201d mode, as he reads to a high school class an \u201cessay\u201d describing a girl he once formed a fascination with. \u201cShe had a virginal quality that contrasted her ice-cold outer shell,\u201d he says vehemently. He goes on to describe how he masturbated to this unnamed girl\u2019s image. He gets giggles from the class and a stern look from a female teacher. Sidney then commiserates with a male teacher, Duane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who\u2019s more sympathetic to his work. The female teacher, he advises Sidney, IS a published author. \u201cOf romance novels,\u201d Sidney sneers. \u201cWhat about Hunter S. Thompson or David Foster Wallace?\u201d Sidney asks earnestly. It is perhaps no coincidence that he names two figures who took their own lives. One of the many things the movie can never quite figure out is that either of those authors would have rather never written a single word had they thought themselves capable of writing a sentence as multi-level-abominable as \u201cShe had a virginal quality that contrasted her ice-cold outer shell.\u201d Advertisement The Movie About A Supposedly Great Writer In Which The Writing The Supposedly Great Writer Produces Kind Of Sucks is not, alas, uncommon. The approximations of Philip Roth that peppered Alex Ross Perry\u2019s \u201cListen Up Philip\u201d never landed smoothly but fortunately the movie had enough misanthropic juice in the story and dialogue to more than get by. What \u201cSidney Hall\u201d has is a lot of misogyny. As in an exchange in which the possible Love of Sidney\u2019s Life tells him that she loves Bob Dylan and horror movies and his response is \u201care you sure you\u2019re a girl?\u201d It also has a lot of what have to be shared fantasies of the screenwriters. The idea that a high school kid, writing a novel with the spectacularly on-the-nose title Suburban Tragedy, can get to the top of the New York Times best seller list for eight\u00a0months, is a big reach. (Would that Thompson and Wallace had done so well!) The movie gifts young Sidney with an indulgent assistant, a hotsy-totsy love affair, and a lot of Downsides To Fame that are even more narcissistic than the imaginary upsides. A reader\u2019s dramatic suicide, accompanied by a statement that Sidney Hall has put his cult on the path to \u201cexpose the suburban underbelly of America no matter what the cost.\u201d A D.B.

How postmodernly \u201cBound for Glory\u201d can you get, people? The movie gives Sidney a kind of stalker, known only as \u201cThe Seeker,\u201d played by Kyle Chandler, who shows up at libraries and bookstores where beardo Sidney shows up to burn copies of his own works, because The Fame Is Bad. The various story threads resolve themselves in flashbacks and flashforwards, the most memorable of which intercuts Sidney being harangued by his mother and Sidney trying to save the life of the woman he has finally realized is his own true love. This is some pretty can\u2019t-live-with-them, can\u2019t-live-without-them stuff, for sure. A climactic flashback reveals the root of Sidney\u2019s guilt has to do with his having watched a video cassette of an unspeakable act that he means to take to the authorities. Only he leaves it in the VCR and the aforementioned mother discovers it, freaks out, and a big old mess ensues. This guy is supposed to be a genius, remember. On the plus side, the movie\u2019s production values are very nice and its cast is notable. And as it happens, neither of those are pluses, because what they mean ultimately is that good money is put into this kind of worthless woman-hating garbage even now.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Tribes of Palos Verdes", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Based on a 1997 novel by Joy Nicholson, \u201cThe Tribes of Palos Verdes\u201d immediately tips the viewer off with the faux-sociology of its blandly ironic title. The story of an affluent family breaking apart after a move from Michigan to the tony coastal town in Los Angeles County, the movie is narrated by the family\u2019s female teen, Medina (Maika Monroe). We first see her swimming in the family\u2019s new, blue-upon-blue swimming pool. Explaining her close bond with her brother, she flatly intones in voiceover, \u201cThat may sound f\u2014ked up, but it\u2019s true. It\u2019s a twin thing.\u201d The prospect of spending the next two hours seeing the world through this character\u2019s eyes is not, at this point, pleasing. Advertisement Meet the Masons: Dad Phi (Justin Kirk) is an innovative cardiologist hoping to make bank and achieve medical celeb status in the new environs. Mom Sandy (Jennifer Garner) is a reluctant Californian, stressed out by all the phonies (the couple\u2019s first night out is at\u00a0 the Friendly Hills Country Club\u2014get it? It\u2019s not really friendly) and the \u201cincessant\u201d crashing of the waves down the hill. Brother Jim (Cody Fern) is preoccupied with popularity, which comes easy to him. Medina is searching for her own groove, which does not concern itself with popularity. High school seen through her eyes is a farrago of distracted vulgarity; all the shots of her classmates show them engaged in simulating sexual activity in distasteful ways. She buys a surfboard from a fatboy neighbor who\u2019s sitting on a few; he charges her a look at her bare breasts. She convinces Jim that surf\u2019s up for the both of them. The sport provides relief for a little while. As Medina puts it: \u201cFor the first time in a long time, we felt like we were in our treehouse again.\u201d A chaos of stars filled the night skies of Palos Verdes, but everything else was regulated,\u201d Medina observes. Not regulated: the emotions of the uniformly unhappy folk in her orbit. Phil falls for the real-estate agent who sold the Masons their home (Alicia Silverstone, not given much to do). Backing out of family life, he leaves Sandy unmoored. Jim, manipulated by his mom into pretending to accept a role as the \u201cman of the house\u201d flips out and starts drugging heavily. This is a world in which nobody is interested in, let alone able to, understand the suffering of those closest to them. In a scene early in the movie, an upset Sandy starts going at her full-body girdle with scissors. In the middle of this action, which would be disturbing to any human being who witnessed is, Medina walks in and nonchalantly asks \u201cMom? I need you to sign something for school.\u201d Because that\u2019s how strong her anomie is. This is pretty standard stuff, and it\u2019s not always rendered too convincingly. Directing brothers Brendan and Emmett Malone have a few tricksy formal tics up their sleeves\u2014long-held overhead views of their characters, shots that begin completely out of focus and are brought into focus within seconds\u2014meant to convey how much is \u201coff\u201d in the world where the tennis-club wives wear matching skirts like uniforms. The middle of the movie softens up, as Medina meets and finds an affinity with Adrian (Noah Silver), the son of Phil\u2019s new squeeze. Medina is snooty at first, but Adrian\u2019s sincerity wins her over, and the movie offers up some sequences of unforced lyricism before bringing the hammer down on the family tragedy. Advertisement The acting is good all around but that, too, improves in the quieter moments. Monroe, best known for her work in \u201cIt Follows,\u201d is tough and committed, and Jennifer Garner\u2019s portrayal of a mad housewife sprinting to a meltdown is acute, even if its does require her to tamp down pretty much all of her engaging life-positive qualities. The Malloys are experienced at shooting surfing, and the scenes on the water make the viewer understand just how Medina gets the bug.

{"Title": "Maps to the Stars", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "David Cronenberg is near the top of the list of directors whose works resist snap judgments. His mix of black comedy and unabashed melodrama is so delicate, and in some ways so off-putting, that at times it's hard to tell if he's kidding or serious (the answer is usually both). He's been described as a horror filmmaker, and his longstanding fascination with bodily invasion and the fragility of flesh confirms that label\u2014or does it? A good many of his films play like horror movies even if they don't have genetic mutations or other obvious \"monsters.\" Why? Maybe because he's less interested in gore and goo than in the beasts within: the monstrous nature of obsession and desire; the difficulty of escaping oneself, physically or emotionally; the cruelty of the societies that enfold and define his characters. Look back over Cronenberg's filmography, and you realize that he hasn't made an according-to-Hoyle horror picture since 1986's \"The Fly.\" The horrific quality seems to come more from his being appalled by what people can be, and do\u2014and from being sympathetic to their urges anyway.  Advertisement \"Maps to the Stars,\" written by Bruce Wagner, is another work in the good old Cronenbergian vein. Although it's been dismissed in some quarters as minor Cronenberg\u2014and criticized for \"getting Hollywood wrong,\" or something like that; as if \"Dead Ringers\" cared about the fine points of gynecology\u2014it's a sneakily powerful movie, so much so that its conceptual thinness isn't a deal-breaker. Not for nothing did Cronenberg model his remake of \"The Fly\" on tragic opera, then re-stage it with his regular composer Howard Shore as an actual opera, with a libretto by David Henry Hwang. This new film's cast of anxious, duplicitous, sometimes violent creative types rattle off declamatory dialogue so overwrought that it could be treated as arias scored for a 40-piece orchestra. The characters inhabit a Los Angeles that seems as intimate, even inbred, as a stereotypical backwoods town: every other scene reveals that characters you didn't know were connected are, in fact, part of an extended family, united not just by blood, but hunger for validation. They want luxury and fame as well, but those are signifiers of what they're truly after: adoration. Love. Unconditional acceptance. Julianne Moore stars as Havana Segrand, a formidable actress whose star has begun to fade now that she's passed 50. Like a lot of characters in this film\u2014and a lot of characters in Cronenberg's films, period, and Wagner's fiction\u2014she's defined by her tragic past, and knows this all too well, and is palpably desperate to escape it and re-create herself. Ironically, though (and appropriately, since this is Cronenberg) she's trying to escape herself by crawling deeper into a psychological cage that's enclosed her since birth: Havana wants to star in a biographical drama about her late mother Clarice Taggart (Sarah Gadon), a mercurial, psychologically and sexually abusive actress who could be a combination of Frances Farmer and Joan Crawford.  This one subplot, about an actress trying to master the awful memories of her mother by figuratively becoming her, gives you some clue what Cronenberg and Wagner are up to, not just with Havana but with all the major characters. Like Cronenberg's little-seen but fascinating \"Spider,\" \"Maps to the Stars\" often feels like a ghost story made by people who don't believe in the supernatural. The mother appears to her daughter in a very straightforward way\u2014as she might manifest herself in a theatrical production. But even though she's clearly an outgrowth of Havana's mangled psyche, you have to count her as an accusing spirit, rattling around in the haunted house of her daughter's damaged mind, and saying the most vile, undermining things. (As if the movie didn't already subtly echo \"The Shining,\" Cronenberg has Clarice appearing to Havana in a bathtub: shades of room 237.) Advertisement Havana, who will do or say just about anything to play her mother and hopefully win an Oscar, is the most vivid of the film's troubled souls, thanks mainly to Moore's utter disinterest in seeming powerful or dignified or otherwise stereotypically movie star-like. From \"Short Cuts\" and \"Safe\" onward, this actress has played troubled, desperate or generally put-upon characters so often that the best actress Oscar she won for \"Still Alice\" might as well have been mounted on a torture rack. But Havana proves merely the brightest star in this film's constellation of scheming sufferers, a bunch whose manias are a bit too contrived and schematic, but which fascinate anyway, thanks to the actors' virtuosity and Cronenberg's control of tone.  Havana's regular therapist/masseuse/TV psychologist is a self-help guru named Dr. Stafford Weiss (John Cusack), a man who presents himself as selfless and caring, but seems determined to crack open repressed minds mainly so he can root around and provoke extreme reactions. (When Stafford manipulates Havana's body on a yoga mat, Cronenberg's staging suggests sex, sometimes rape.)\u00a0  Havana's new personal assistant, Stafford's daughter Agatha Weiss (Mia Wasikowska), wears long gloves to cover arms that were burned in a mysterious fire; at first she seems almost Pollyanna-sweet, but soon enough she reveals a capacity for ruthlessness that rivals Havana's. The ghost story parallels continue via Agatha, who haunts Stafford; his brittle, fearful wife Cristina (Olivia Williams, in the latest in a series of knockout supporting performances), and Agatha's kid brother Benjie. The youngest Weiss is a cruel and territorial former child star who's looking to escape the gilded prison of juvenile idol-hood. Benjie is played by Evan Bird of \"The Killing,\" an actor whose haircut and clipped delivery revoke Frankie Muniz on \"Malcolm in the Middle\" when the character isn't doing a snotnosed power-broker routine, lounging around nightclubs like Leonard DiCaprio in his post-\"Titanic\" period. Compared to all these misfits, slimeballs and emotional basket cases, Robert Pattinson's limo driver and aspiring screenwriter Jerome Fontana seems well-adjusted, but as is so often the case with Wagner's characters, you'd best not get too comfortable with him. (This is the second time Pattinson has spent time in a limo for Cronenberg, after \"Cosmopolis,\" and the second time he's delivered a top-notch, blase-sexy-decadent performance.) I'm not convinced that the film's themes and situations are deep enough or well-articulated enough to deserve the brilliant filmmaking and acting placed in their service. As the story wears on and we glean new bits of information establishing the characters' connections, the story starts to seem less operatically inevitable than contrived and convenient: too neat, and trying to camouflage its too-neatness with wrenching scenes of violence and self-abasement. By the time you get to the end, Cronenberg has pinned all his people against the screen like so many laboratory specimens, ripped off their scabs, and vivisected their longings: an old wound here, a long--deferred dream there. Still, the movie sticks with you. It's a fleeting nightmare that refuses to fade. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Youth in Oregon", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "This is a big month for bad wordplay in independent film titles. There\u2019s a picture opening called \u201cDark Night\u201d which was inspired by the 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, where another movie whose name you\u2019ll never guess was screening. As for this item, directed by Joel David Moore (who\u2019s also a reasonably busy character actor, although he doesn\u2019t appear here) from a script by first-time-feature-writer Andrew Eisen, it is not a movie about young people in Oregon, as one might glean during the opening of the film, which designates Frank Langella as the lead actor and shows him, shirtless, in front of a bathroom mirror, being not terribly youthful. No, the title is a play on the word \u201ceuthanasia.\u201d Langella\u2019s character, newly 80 years old, lives, imposingly, in the house owned by his adult daughter Kate (Christina Applegate) and her husband Brian (Billy Crudup). Things are a little crowded in the house: Kate and Brian have two kids, hot-to-trot (if you\u2019ll excuse the expression) cheerleader Annie (Nicola Peltz) and rather more withdrawn Nick (Alex Shaffer), and Langella\u2019s Ray has a wife, Estelle (Mary Kay Place). The movie begins on a busy morning. Brian\u2019s asked to attend a clogged toilet, Annie\u2019s taking under-the-shirt selfies to text to her football-player boyfriend, and the ceaselessly cranky Ray has a doctor\u2019s appointment.  Advertisement At said appointment, Ray learns that the heart surgery he had a couple of years before hasn\u2019t entirely fixed his problems, and he confidentially tells his doctor he doesn\u2019t want any new surgery. That evening, at a party for his 80th birthday, upstaging an egregiously overacting waiter who goes on at length about a meal served with \u201ca creamy white sauce with herbs and spices\u201d (seriously, the guy comes on like he\u2019s in a Monty Python sketch), Ray gets up and announces that he has decided to die, and that he wants to go to Oregon, where he owns a property and where the laws pertaining to checking out with extreme prejudice are somewhat agreeable, and get it over with. The thing is, he insists on going from the East Coast to Oregon by car, because he doesn\u2019t fly. I know, I too raised an eyebrow at a character who is hell bent on ending his own life but won\u2019t take an airplane to get to he place where he\u2019s going to do it. But this is the kind of movie \u201cYouth in Oregon\u201d is: a movie that has to have a Road Trip, because it will only be through a Road Trip that the characters can go through the kind of self-discovery that is the very raison d\u2019etre of such entertainments. And so, with Brian offering to drive even though he thinks he\u2019s faking out Ray and Estelle\u2014the idea is he\u2019ll talk some sense into his father-in-law and they\u2019ll all drive back home together\u2014the journey, accompanied by a solemn original music score fueled by minimal piano and mournful cello, begins. Ray insists on listening to birdcall CDs in the car. Stopping for lunch, he gets tetchy about not getting any mayo on sandwich, and when Brian wryly brings up Viagra for some reason, Ray gets to boasting about past sexual prowess, and loudly, so the \u201cfeisty old guy acts embarrassingly in a restaurant\u201d requirement is checked off. As Brian\u2019s driving falters on account of being tired, Estelle, apparently a current or former nurse, offers him some uppers, and indulges a bit herself, so the \u201ccomedic bonding via pharmaceuticals\u201d requirement is checked off. And so on. At Salt Lake City, Josh Lucas turns up as Ray\u2019s estranged son, and the resentment between them is so thick that of course this character is the only one in whom Ray confides his condition. Back home, Annie keeps giving Kate trouble, and the movie gets padded in an unusual way, that is, with the suggestion of a sex scene between Annie and the aforementioned football player boyfriend (Will Janowitz). They\u2019re supposed to be on the outs because the aforementioned under-the-shirt selfies leaked to the high school populace in general, and when Kate walks in on the bubbling-up action, she is none too pleased. Yeah, I don\u2019t know either. And on it goes, all coming together in the foreshadowed Oregon property (which is well-kept in the way that such places are only in some movies) and with one character pleading \u201cPlease help me fix our family\u201d followed by a requisite reverse shot with a wide\u00a0angle lens taking in a beautiful view of nature to contemplate as a human gesture of reconciliation is contemplated, then executed. Is this all well-acted? It certainly is, especially by Langella. But all things being equal, I\u2019d prefer to see him in a revival of \u201cThe Man Who Came To Dinner.\u201d Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Ruby (Jamie Chung), a Chinese-American new to Hong Kong, stands outside a bar attempting to track down her friends. She has no idea where she is. A guy overhears her and steps in to help. This is Josh (Bryan Greenberg), who has lived in Hong Kong for 10 years. He's \"in finance.\" He knows his way around and speaks Cantonese. After momentary hesitation on her part, the two of them set out into the neon-gleam glamour of Hong Kong on a night-long \"walk and talk.\" Their bantering conversation has all the markings of a successful (albeit accidental) first date, punctuated by sight-seeing. The formula of \"Already\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong,\" written, directed, and produced by Emily Ting (her first feature) is one that has worked before.  Advertisement But the film lacks the underlying subtext that grounded similar hopeful-yet-doomed-romance stories in the past. The dialogue, charmingly delivered by the two leads, remains on a surface jokey level. The stakes are not high enough for either character and the two-people-at-a-fork-in-the-road story never comes to life, a practically fatal flaw. The essential element that such stories must achieve is the knowledge that the two characters need to be together. An audience must ache for the characters to break through to deeper intimacy with one another.  As Josh walks Ruby to her destination, they get to know each other and he shows her the sights. Josh expresses dissatisfaction with his finance job and wants to quit and be a novelist. (Of course he does.) Ruby, who barely knows him, launches into an inspirational speech about taking chances. He appears blown away by her banal insight. It's hard to believe he has never heard such a thing before. But it sets up the too-easy idea that his \"brief encounter\" with Ruby changes the course of his life. Ruby, too, a toy-designer, has unrealized dreams.  These are familiar devices and they can work. Ruby and Josh are so financially fortunate (no crime in that, they both work hard) it has softened them, made them lazy, complacent. Ruby barely notices Hong Kong, and complains about the lack of Netflix and the fact that it is impossible to get good Mexican food. Josh knows the cool non-tourist places to go, but has no perspective on his circumstances outside of the fact that, to Los Angelenos, it's \"already\u00a0tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong.\" Ruby and Josh, then, seem un-curious, and un-engaged with their own lives. It's hard to invest in two people who have so readily taken the easy way out.  Advertisement Ruby and Josh both have off-screen partners who make their presence known through phone messages or Outlook reminders of an upcoming Skype call. Their emotions towards their respective partners are ambivalent at best, and the problem with that is that the two come off as people looking for an excuse to cheat as opposed to a situation much more unstable and important. You know a \"romance\" film isn't working when you think in exasperation, \"Oh, go ahead, just cheat if your relationship bores you so much. No one'll know.\" Or: \"Break up with your partner. For God's sake, you're not married. No harm no foul.\" It's not the most romantic vibe.  Cinematographer Josh Silfen provides a welcome variety of angles to all the talk, the camera sometimes following the two from behind, or swinging around to move along ahead of them. Silfen also shows a visual sensitivity to the lights of Hong Kong: they blur and twinkle in the background/foreground, creating a dreamy atmosphere. It's a poetic style that serves a purpose: despite the attention-getting surroundings, the focus is on the one-on-one interaction of Ruby and Josh.\u00a0 The style keeps \"Already\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong\" from being a glorified travelogue, but unfortunately it also hones in on the lack of chemistry between the two leads. Both Greenberg and Chung were executive producers on the film. Both are obviously talented. Greenberg is effortlessly charming in a very real-guy kind of way. And Chung manages the switch-backs of mood and energy with ease. But Josh and Ruby \"bond\" during a conventional shopping montage, where they haggle over the price of a selfie stick, and an awkward scene where they get their fortunes told. Think of River Phoenix and Lili Taylor in \"Dogfight,\" which has a similar \"sightseeing\" structure, or Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in \"Before Sunrise\" paying the guy lying by the river to write a poem for them, and the difference is palpable. What is missing is the magic of connection.  \"Already\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong\" is in the long tradition of extended \"meet-cutes,\" films like Vincente Minnelli's \"The Clock,\" David Lean's \"Brief Encounter,\" Nancy Savoca's \"Dogfight\" and Richard Linklater's \"Before\" trilogy. There are elements of cultural disorientation too, reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's \"Lost in Translation.\" It is clear that Ting knows the \"bucket\" in which she wants to place her story, and the mood of self-control and bittersweet longing she wants to create. There are moments, brief moments, when that tone is achieved, but overall Ruby and Josh's connection has more in common with the feather-weight \"relationship\" of Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro in \"Falling in Love\" than the torment of \"Brief Encounter\" or the urgency of \"The Clock.\" If nothing else, \"Already\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong\" is an object lesson in just how difficult it is to make a film successful with this story-structure. It reminds us what a miracle \"The Clock\" or \"Before Sunrise\" were, the stories shimmering with delicacy and inference, in-depth conversations leading to connections more intellectual than sexual, masterpieces of barely-controlled passion and longing. \"Already\u00a0Tomorrow\u00a0in Hong Kong\" suffers in comparison.

{"Title": "Clouds of Sils Maria", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Depending on where you sit, this movie\u2019s a draw for very\r\ndifferent reasons.

Which is not to say that movies like\r\n\u201cMaps To The Stars\u201d (Pattinson working for the second time with maestro of\r\nunsettling content David Cronenberg) or this Stewart co-starrer are fated to\r\nrack up \u201cTwilight\u201d-comparable numbers. But they will be seen by a segment of\r\nthe mass audience that in most other circumstances isn\u2019t interested in auteurs.\r\nThe Stewart-intrigue factor is in itself a double-edged sword, because for\r\nevery 10,000 growing teens for whom Stewart can do no wrong, there\u2019s one film critic,\r\namateur or professional, who still is not sure if Stewart \u201ccan act.\u201d (I am not\r\none of these; I was impressed by her in \u201cPanic Room,\u201d \u201cUndertow,\u201d and \u201cInto The\r\nWild,\u201d to name three of her pre-\u201cTwilight\u201d films.) They look to films such as\r\nthis one, and another recent Stewart indie, \u201cCamp X-Ray,\u201d to settle the\r\nquestion for them once and for all.  Advertisement Then there are those for whom this movie\u2019s a draw because of\r\nits writer/director, Olivier Assayas, working here not just with Stewart but\r\nwith the great French actress Juliette Binoche, who was also in Assayas\u2019\r\nterrific 2008 family drama \u201cSummer Hours.\u201d Assayas is one of world cinema\u2019s\r\nmost penetrating and unpredictable talents; for instance, the two films he made\r\nprior to this one were \u201cSomething In The Air,\u201d an affecting, autobiographical\r\ncoming-of-age story of politics and cinema in the early \u201870s, and before that,\r\nthe sweeping, bracing, not-at-all-sweet \u201cCarlos,\u201d a trenchant biopic of the\r\ntitular real-life terrorism perpetrator whose activities galvanized Europe for\r\na period. \u201cClouds of Sils Maria\u201d is entirely different in some ways from those\r\ntwo films, but its invented worlds are very much in keeping with Assayas\u2019\r\nconcerns about how art and reality intertwine and feed off of each other.  The setup for the picture seems to promise a story of\r\nrivalry among artists: the movie begins on a train; world-renowned actress\r\nMaria (Binoche) is on her way to visit her artistic mentor Wilhelm Melchior,\r\nand deliver a speech at a ceremony honoring the reclusive theater master. Maria\r\nhas her efficient but frazzled and very hip young American assistant Val\r\n(Stewart) in tow; Val\u2019s the one in charge of the schedules, the multiple\r\nsmartphones, and the texting, and it\u2019s Val who first learns that Melchior, the\r\nman they\u2019re on their way to see, has died.  This loss changes the dynamic of the event. Maria has barely\r\ntime to register her loss than she\u2019s regaled with Chanel in a theater corridor;\r\nwhisked through a photo shoot; reintroduced to a former co-star she never\r\nliked; and approached by a hot young theater director to appear in a revival of\r\nthe Melchior play that made her famous. Playing, and this is no small thing,\r\nnot the ing\u00e9nue role that she is now to old for, but the role of an older, more\r\nembittered character. Set to play the younger woman\u2019s role is of course a\r\nyounger woman, a scandal-riddled star played by Chloe Grace Moretz and\r\ninitially seen mainly via paparazzi videos Val finds for Maria on YouTube.\r\nAfter this flurry of activity Val and Maria repair to Melchior\u2019s house in the\r\ntitle village. It\u2019s not far from this place that a particular cloud formation\r\ncalled the Maloja Snake, which provides the Melchior play with its own title,\r\noccurs. Aside from feeding each other lines from Melchior\u2019s play, and arguing\r\nabout life and art and career, Maria and Val aspire to go on a hike and witness\r\nthe snake-like cloud formation as it appears. In the meanwhile, elsewhere in\r\nEurope, Jo-Ann (Moretz) and her latest male conquest, a boy toy with literary\r\npedigree, hone in on, you might have guessed it, an opportunity to stretch\r\ncreative muscles and/or gain some form of artistic cred; for whatever reason,\r\nJo-Ann is hungry for a form of respectability even if she can\u2019t quite fathom\r\nwhat kind, not to even mention why.  Advertisement In pr\u00e9cis form this material looks like an unlikely walk\r\ninto \u201cAll About Eve\u201d territory for Assayas, only with more self-reflexivity.\r\nBut in spite of the superficial dynamics of the\r\nyoung-actress-meets/conquers-older-star scenario, which are fully acknowledged,\r\n\u201cClouds of Sils Maria\u201d is oodles more poetic and enigmatic than the term\r\n\u201cbackstage drama\u201d generally encompasses. It isn\u2019t a story of predatory ambition\r\nor women stabbing each other in the back; all the characters in the movie have\r\ntheir reasons, but the film, at least in the show business aspects of its\r\nstory, is concerned with the paradox of self-preservation within an enterprise\r\nthat requires you have to invest your trust with so many other people. Artistic\r\ncreation begins in the first person singular, but then turns plural, and not\r\neveryone who gets on board makes it all the way to the end of the trip. To that\r\nend, Assayas executes a gambit in the final fifth of the movie that makes\r\nmatters all the more enigmatic. It\u2019s almost as if the conflicts the film\r\ndepicts up until this point\u2014rendered in convincing, epigrammatic dialogue and\r\naction, performed with sometimes searing conviction by Binoche and Stewart in\r\nparticular\u2014have suddenly been deemed too pat by the filmmaker. His way of\r\nshaking thing up is\u2026intriguing, for sure. It's one of those moves that make a second\r\nviewing worth contemplating. In any event, the pleasures of the acting and the\r\never-acute visuals are apt to make a second viewing a distinct pleasure, even\r\nif it doesn\u2019t solve anything.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Columbus", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The buildings rise up out of the grass and trees like relics of a mysterious more sophisticated civilization. They are abstract, startling, sometimes anti-gravitational. They are not monuments. They were built for utilitarian purposes: banks, offices, a church, a library, a hospital. These geometric Modernist buildings pepper the landscape of the \"Midwest Mecca of Architecture,\" Columbus, Indiana, and were designed by some of the most innovative architects of the 20th century: it's no wonder people travel there from all over to take architecture tours. Columbus' architecture is the canvas for \"Columbus,\" the stunning directorial debut of Kogonada (mainly known up until now as a video essayist, whose Vimeo page\u00a0is a great archive of visual analysis). What Kogonada has done with \"Columbus\" (along with cinematographer Elisha Christian) is to blend the background into the foreground and vice versa, so that you see things through the eyes of the two architecture-obsessed main characters. Watching the film is almost like feeling the muscles in your eyes shift, as you look up from reading a book to stare out at the ocean. From the very first shot, it's clear that the buildings will be essential. They are a part of the lives unfolding in their shadows. Sometimes it almost seems like they are listening.\u00a0 Advertisement There is a story in \"Columbus.\" What is remarkable is how intense it is, given the stillness and quiet of Kogonada's style, and the focus with which he films the buildings.\u00a0 A Korean-born man named Jin (John Cho) travels to Columbus to care for his father, who is in the hospital following a catastrophic collapse. Accompanying him is an old friend (and possibly onetime lover), who was also his father's star pupil, played by Parker Posey. Jin has a distant relationship with his father. He can't connect with the worry and sadness his friend is feeling. On a separate track initially, we meet Casey (Haley Lu Richardson), working as a page at the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library (one of the most important interiors in the film). Casey has graduated from high school but has put off going to college perhaps indefinitely because her mother is a former meth addict. (\"Meth is really big here,\" says Casey. \"Meth and Modernism.\") She fears what will happen to her mother without her. Casey and a coworker (Rory Culkin) have interesting discussions, sitting amidst the towering stacks, their conversations a blend of tentative flirting, kindness, and gentle debate. One day, Jin bums a cigarette from Casey. They strike up a conversation.\u00a0 Over the course of \"Columbus,\" Casey, obsessed with architecture, takes Jin around, showing him her favorite buildings (she has a list). Jin is significantly older than Casey, but he treats her as a peer. There is instantly an intimacy between them, perhaps because both are so exhausted by their life circumstances. Their dynamic is fascinating. There's an irritable quality to some of it, as though neither one of them wants to let the other \"get away with\" just skating off the surface of things. When Casey rattles off facts about the famous glass bank designed by Eero Saarinen, Jin gets bored. He pushes her to go deeper: what does the building make you feel? There were only a couple of moments when the script was a little on the nose. But even in those moments the characters were wandering through such interesting spaces that there was always plenty to look at.\u00a0 Kogonada places their human figures against striking man-made backdrops with extreme care. He chooses his angles meticulously. There isn't an uninteresting shot in the whole thing. Shots repeat. Alleyways, sculptures, doorways, glass walls, the clocktower with the asymmetrical clockface, the church with the asymmetrical cross ... we go back to them again and again, Kogonada giving us time to contemplate them, to sink into them. There's so much sadness in the film, it seeps into the air. Kogonada allows space for it, interspersing the conversations between Jin and Casey, or Casey and her mother, with long still shots of the library's striking ceiling, of the glass bank gleaming at night, the glass walkway hovering over a river, of the two brick monoliths floating in the air, almost, but not quite, touching. It's a profound approach. The depth of emotion the film stirred up surprised me. I got so involved in these two people's lives. I cared about them. I liked eavesdropping on their conversations. Advertisement When I first moved to New York, every time I caught a glimpse of the Chrysler Building's whimsical jewel-like crown, my breath would catch in my throat. Eventually, over time, I got used to it as part of my everyday world. But there are moments, usually at dusk, when suddenly it's like I see it for the first time, and I stare upward, taking a moment to appreciate that architect William Van Alen thought that building up, that he saw something that beautiful in his mind, and that he knew what it would add to the skyline: something so tall, and yet also so delicate. I try to remind myself: Make sure to look at the Chrysler Building on occasion. Make sure to appreciate it. \"Columbus\" is a movie about the experience of looking, the interior space that opens up when you devote yourself to looking at something, receptive to the messages it might have for you. Movies (the best ones anyway) are the same way. Looking at something in a concentrated way requires a mind-shift. Sometimes it takes time for the work to even reach you, since there's so much mental ballast in the way. The best directors point to things, saying, in essence: \"Look.\"\u00a0I haven't been able to get \"Columbus\" out of my mind.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Vault", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "On one of the worst moviegoing weekends of the year\u2014go check out our reviews of \u201cJackals,\u201d \u201cTemple,\u201d and \u201cGoon: Last of the Enforcers\u201d for just a taste of the awful\u2014it was even more disconcerting than usual to hear that \"The Vault\" wouldn\u2019t be made available early for reviews. Yes, there are films that screen for critics that end up being surprisingly solid\u2014maybe the studio just doesn\u2019t have the confidence they should in it\u2014but it\u2019s more often that they\u2019re trying to hide a piece of junk. So, while I desperately try to approach each film with as much optimism as possible, it was difficult when I sat down to watch \u201cThe Vault\u201d to not be a little concerned. Much to my surprise, this genre hybrid has its moments\u2014way more than several of the films this week being made widely available to critics. It won\u2019t change your life, but it won\u2019t make you angry either. Labor Day weekend for a limited and VOD release? That\u2019s almost a positive review. Advertisement Sadly, \u201calmost\u201d is as good as I can get for \u201cThe Vault,\u201d a film that merges the bank robbery flick with a haunted house movie. Yes, it\u2019s \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d meets \u201cThe Haunting.\u201d And while that\u2019s an undeniably fun idea, director Dan Bush (\u201cThe Signal\u201d) doesn\u2019t quite know how to pull off either half. Both the heist movie and the spooky flick are underdeveloped with the former lacking the intense dedication to geography that puts you in the middle of the scene and the latter resorting too often to jump scares and undefined rules of the game. And then there\u2019s the ending, which is so resolutely stupid that I suspect the few people who do see this in theaters this weekend will throw their remaining popcorn at the screen. Co-written by Bush and Conal Byrne, \u201cThe Vault\u201d is a (mostly) single-setting affair at what looks like a relatively ordinary bank on what seems like a relatively ordinary morning. A young woman named Leah (Francesca Eastwood, Clint\u2019s daughter) is applying for a job as a teller; another woman named Vee (Taryn Manning) is complaining about checks that shouldn\u2019t have bounced; a local cop (Clifton Collins, Jr.) is flirting with another teller named Susan (Q\u2019orianka Kilcher). There\u2019s a lot of noise coming from outside from a fire down the street, and a trio of firemen enter the bank to make sure it\u2019s secure as well\u2014and then they\u2019re revealed to be robbers, working in conjunction with Leah and Vee. In fact, the two ladies are sisters, backing up their brother, the head fireman/robber Michael (Scott Haze), who needs some cash to get out of a really bad situation. They\u2019re not gonna hurt anyone. They\u2019ll just take what they need and leave. The problems start when the siblings discover that there\u2019s not much money in this small bank\u2014only about $70k. That\u2019s when another employee named Ed (James Franco) steps in to tell them a secret\u2014there\u2019s a second vault in the basement, and that one\u2019s got millions in it. Of course, there\u2019s a reason no one goes in the basement vault, and the robbers release something ancient and evil when they break into it. Before you know it, people are seeing shapes that don\u2019t show up on the security cameras and doing awfully gory things to themselves. Now, the robbers and employees have to escape something much worse than a federal crime. Advertisement Eastwood is a charismatic lead, and the rest of the supporting cast is adequate, but Bush can\u2019t quite figure out what movie he\u2019s making. He needed to co-write and direct a bank robbery film that worked on its own terms, without the hulking ghosts in the basement, but we know that\u2019s not this movie, and so the first act is something of a dull waiting game, waiting for the carnage to kick in. Once it does, I was surprised at how much the leads worked to keep the silliness from verging into camp. Eastwood, Kilcher and Haze sell the confusion and fear of their predicament. And while Franco looks bored too often, his is a smaller role than the poster would have you believe.  Ultimately, \u201cThe Vault\u201d isn\u2019t silly enough to be horrendously memorable or tense enough to be effective as the genre exercise it could have been. It falls into that underdeveloped gap in the middle. Maybe that\u2019s why the studio hid it from critics. It wasn\u2019t that it was awful, it was that they forgot they were releasing it.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Every Thing Will Be Fine", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The opening and closing sequences of \"Every Thing Will Be Fine,\" the first\r\nfiction feature from German director Wim Wenders in almost a decade, are among\r\nthe most masterful he\u2019s created, and over the course of his long career he\u2019s\r\ncreated quite a few such scenes \u2026 and, more to the point, quite a few such whole\r\nfilms. But bear with me.  The opening sequence sees young writer Tomas (James Franco)\r\nseeking space to create in a fisherman\u2019s hut on a frozen lake. Dispirited,\r\nunproductive, he tools around on land a bit, having intermittent tetchy phone\r\nconversations with his girlfriend Sara (Rachel McAdams). Driving in a snowstorm,\r\nhe\u2019s distracted, and has an automobile mishap. He\u2019s relieved to find a\r\ncompletely intact, but very shaken up child propped right next to his front\r\nbumper, and walks the boy to the remote farm house up the hill, from which he\r\nwas no doubt darting out with his plastic sled. Once they get to the house, the\r\nother shoe drops when they meet the boy\u2019s mother, Kate (Charlotte Gainsbourg).\r\nThere\u2019s almost no dialogue, only a calm command of cinema language, conjuring\r\nsuspense, dread and poignancy, enhanced by Wenders\u2019 expressive use of 3D, a format he also used for his spectacular 2011 dance documentary \u201cPina.\u201d  Advertisement So far so good, at least as far as the movie is concerned.\r\nNot so much for Tomas, who\u2019s traumatized by the accident to the extent that he\r\nchecks out on life big time, ending in a hospital bed after what Sara\r\nrecognizes as a half-hearted suicide attempt. So, yes: this is a movie in which\r\nJames Franco plays a white, male, mostly-self-tortured artist, coping with a\r\nmajor spiritual crisis. What could be worse?  In theory, I agree with you. And in practice, \u201cEvery Thing\r\nWill Be Fine\u201d wears a certain preciosity on its sleeve, starting with the\r\ntitle, with its deliberately broken \u201cEverything,\u201d oy. One might suspect The New\r\nSincerity in action, except that Wenders has always been a one-hundred percent\r\nsincere filmmaker, whether creating such acute stories of existential anxiety\r\nas \u201cThe American Friend,\u201d luminous, mysticism-laden parables of love like\r\n\u201cWings of Desire,\u201d or atrociously soft-headed meditations on being a man out of\r\ntime, as in his dire 2008 \u201cPalermo Shooting,\u201d his most recent fiction feature\r\nand not a particularly good omen for this one. \u201cEvery Thing Will Be Fine\u201d is in a very real sense\r\nthematically quaint, and too often the screenplay, by Bj\u00f8rn Olaf Johannessen, is\r\nspectacularly verbally maladroit, not to mention vague. \u201cNeither of us is fine \u2026 we want different\r\nthings in life \u2026 I just want to write \u2026\u00a0\u201d is the sort of thing the performers have\r\nto work with for the first half of the movie. As irritating as the commonplaces\r\nare, and as distractingly bad as the dialogue gets, glints and glimmers of\r\nperception and feeling find their way out from the 3D frame. Gainsbourg\u2019s\r\nsingle mom character, an illustrator, has a quiet, enigmatic dignity, and the\r\nscenes at the center of the film between her and Franco seem to want to take\r\nthe narrative in a more expansive direction, away from the commonplace\r\nsolipsism of Tomas\u2019 character, who by this point has moved on from Sara and\r\ninto a relationship with Maria Jos\u00e9e Croze\u2019s Ann, herself the mother of a young\r\ngirl. The narrative, as it happens, moves across a span of twelve years, and\r\ndoes go to some disturbing and unexpected places. Tomas\u2019 encounter with Sara\r\nmany years after the fact is satisfying in a way the filmmakers perhaps did not\r\nintend, but I can\u2019t be too confident about that.  And Franco actually does mostly alright by his possibly\r\nimpossible character. His inspired work in \u201cSpring Breakers\u201d notwithstanding,\r\nhe\u2019s been frittering away his credibility as a dramatic actor for some time, but given the lack of detail he\u2019s got to work with here, he\u2019s not a presence\r\nyou want to eye-roll off the screen. Although the point in the film at which\r\nhis performance needs to gather strength\u2014a tense kitchen-table confrontation\r\nwith another male near the end\u2014is exactly the point where he trots out his\r\nstoner squint-and-smirk; not really the right choice. Elsewhere he\u2019s\r\nfine, and particularly fine when his character is called upon to examine his\r\nown lack of affect.  Advertisement \u201cEvery Thing Will Be Fine\u201d is far from a perfect film. But\r\nWenders is trying to do new things within the confines of a pretty standard\r\nEuropean art-film scenario, and the viewer can see he\u2019s not approaching the\r\nmaterial as though it\u2019s rote; he\u2019s really trying to use the camera to get\r\nthrough the feelings of loss the characters suffer. Wenders is also the author\r\nof a book of essays called \u201cEmotion Pictures,\u201d and he once again brings some\r\nhonor to that concept with this flawed but intriguing work.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Permanent", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Every generation of girls has its aspirational hairstyle. I grew up on the tail-end of the Farrah Fawcett era, punctuated by Dorothy Hamill-mania and Princess Di-frenzy. My idol when I was 10 was Andrea McArdle, star of the Broadway show \"Annie,\" who had a bob cut with a little curl coming down either side of her face. My hair was too thin to replicate the look, even with the help of a curling iron. I was devastated. In an act of meaningless revenge, I cut off all my hair in an attempt to put the bouncy Dorothy Hamill-Andrea McArdle bob of my dreams firmly in the rear-view mirror. In \"Permanent,\" writer/director Colette Burson (creator of the HBO series \"Hung\") uses the premise of a Tween's bad haircut to explore\u2014to varying degrees of success\u2014issues of family, class, adolescence. Advertisement The year is 1982. Farrah Fawcett's hair still reigns. Young Aurelie (Kira McLean), who has moved with her parents to a Virginia suburb, stares longingly at the bouncing thick locks of the middle-school girls around her, and begs her parents (Patricia Arquette and Rainn Wilson) to let her get a \"permanent.\" Her whole life will be different\u2014especially in a new school where she knows no one\u2014if her hair had more \"body\"! But Aurelie's parents are openly broke, and the beauty salon trainee who administers Aurelie's perm leaves her looking like Little Orphan Annie with a finger in an electrical socket. The bullying she gets at school, already bad, ratchets up a notch. She gets in fights. All she needs to do is somehow come up with 60 bucks to get her hair straightened. She schemes and plans for a way to get that money. \"Permanent\" is filled with ineffectual narcissistic adults and children as cruel as Black Hats in a classic Western. Everyone mispronounces Aurelie's name (a teacher calls her \"Areola\" at one point). Jim, Aurelie's dad, was a steward on Air Force One, and proudly displays all of the signed photographs from U.S. presidents. He's going back to school, but stymied by his fear of swimming (long story). One look at the toupee glued onto his head makes it obvious where his daughter gets her hair insecurities. Jeanne, Aurelie's mother, is overworked and sexually frustrated (\"Jim!\" she pleads at one point, \"Sex is free!\"). Her main goal in life is to touch a dolphin and she's so furious when Jim doesn't show the appropriate interest that she sleeps on a blanket in the backyard. (Arquette and Wilson make a wonderful comedic team.) They are a family of misfit toys. Each person is afraid of everything, of change, of not belonging, of rejection. The trio freezes up when an unexpected knock comes on the front door. \"What is wrong with us that we're all afraid to open the door?\" moans Jeanne from her spot on the couch. The group family scenes are the best in the film. Aurelie befriends the straight-talking Lydia (Nena Daniels), who has been placed in remedial classes for no reason other than she is a black girl in a predominantly white school. A condescending teacher, speaking slowly, asks her to name a word starting with the sound \"sh.\" You can probably imagine Lydia's irritated reply. Lydia and Aurelie team up\u2014most memorably during a brutal scooter-hockey game in gym class, filmed like it's the World Cup\u2014to try to get back at the mean girls who torment their lives. Young Daniels, a Richmond native, has an Oscar-worthy moment late in the film during a school-wide poetry reading. The connections made in Burson's script between Aurelie's bad perm and Lydia's braided hair is not well-considered, especially when Lydia decides to unbraid her hair in a moment of shared freedom. \"Permanent\" is not substantial enough a story to be able to support a commentary on African-American girls and their hair. The film has a good comedic rhythm, and there's a rambunctious bickering energy in every scene. It's often quite funny. But \"Permanent\" feels like a short film stretched to feature length. It never quite rises above the level of its premise. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "In Transit", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"In Transit\" is a film about people riding a train from one place to another, talking about their lives with other passengers. That's all there is to it, and yet that's not all there is to it. The movie is a throwback to an earlier era of documentaries, when filmmakers did not feel obligated by commercial pressure to give their film the shape of a thriller, a sports film, a mystery or anything else, but instead simply brought their cameras into people's lives. The setting is the Empire Builder, an Amtrak train that journeys between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest, serving Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon as well as points in between; its route includes North Dakota, a new oil boom region that supplies many of this film's intriguing characters.\u00a0 Advertisement This film is nearly as welcome a breath of fresh air as my favorite film of 2016, Kirsten Johnson's \"Cameraperson,\" an autobiographical essay film made up of footage shot by a camerawoman over three decades, arranged in editing so that fragments of other people's lives explore universal concerns, such as war, trauma, childhood, parenting, illness, death, and the ethics of storytelling. \"In Transit\" is similarly supple and mysterious in the stories it tells and the points that it makes. And when it does make points, it never hammers them. It has a light touch, and many of the larger connections it draws are conveyed through editing, as when characters talk about the past that they left behind when starting over, and the movie cuts to a shot from the last car on the train, watching the rails recede into the distance. Considering that \"in Transit\" has no main character\u2014unless you count the train itself\u2014it is a remarkably coherent work. Clocking in at a brisk 75 minutes, it gives\u00a0us tantalizing glimpses into people's lives that suggest the totality of their experience while leaving us wanting more. This is my principal complaint about the movie\u2014it's a rare feature that might've benefited from a longer running time, because some of the characters' stories are interesting enough to linger on; at the very least, there are points where I wouldn't have minded if the filmmakers had stayed with one person for a couple minutes longer instead of cross-cutting between two or three stories.\u00a0 But the impulse to keep things moving relentlessly forward suits a film set on a train, and the people we do meet are consistently fascinating, even when we initially mistake them for merely eccentric or self-involved. We meet a mother and a daughter who bond by riding the rails, an immigrant woman who wants to see as much of her new country as possible, and a young man who's nervous about meeting a woman he courted from afar for many years. A very pregnant woman has a long conversation with an older man who keeps taking pictures through the windows, documenting his trip; we don't learn his story until much later, and it's so moving that I'd rather not spoil it here.  Advertisement \"In Transit\" is also a rare American film that gives us a sense of the richness of this country, both geographically and in terms of life experience. While the passenger manifest is predominantly white\u2014unsurprisingly, considering the states that the train is passing through\u2014there are passengers of many other races and ethnicities, as well as a variety of social classes, including many working class people who are either coming from oil fields or headed there. A series of scenes in the film's midsection lets us eavesdrop on a thirtysomething African-American man as he's counseled by a much older African-American man who knew Dr. Martin Luther King; their conversation focuses on optimism, ethics and the importance of love; its conclusion, a solo statement about life by the elder man, is one of the highlights of this moviegoing year.  As anybody who's familiar with public transit will attest, there's something about taking a long ride by yourself that encourages you to volunteer information you might not discuss with your own family. Passengers talk to the filmmakers and to each other about their relationship and marital troubles, their doubts about their career, their fear of aging, illness and death, and the difficulty of making a living in a supposed land of plenty. As the characters talk, mill about, eat, sleep, play cards and talk on the phone, the film crew's cameras frame them within an array of geometric spaces created by the rectangular shapes of windows and door frames, and track their progress from car to car, the overhead lighting panels and regimented rows of seats stretching into the distance in exaggerated perspective that makes the train seem a thousand miles long. The sound design is exceptional as well. There is no score to speak of, only snippets of pop songs that we hear briefly on passengers' phones, plus a bit of an old standard played (with merciful brevity) on a ukulele. After a while, the noises of the train itself become the binding element of the experience of watching \"In Transit\": the bell going ding-ding as the train goes into a station, the horn blowing as the train glides around corners or passes through towns.  No surprise that such an old-school project was masterminded by the late Albert Maysles (1926-2015). With his brother David (1931-1987), Maysles helped create \"Direct Cinema,\" an observational type of filmmaking that believed that the filmmaker should be as unobtrusive as possible, both in the room with subjects and later on when the footage is being edited. Maysles talked about \"In Transit\" for nearly two decades before this movie finally, posthumously appeared. It was originally envisioned as his pet project made of footage collected while riding trains: he would just take out his camera, interview people who were in the compartment with him, and then either keep going after they got off the train or disembark with them and see where they were going. I'm not sure how much footage he collected, but I'm told by people who worked with him that there was a lot. When I interviewed him for the Star-Ledger in 2000, he talked about and described some footage he'd already shot and made \"In Transit\" sound like the movie he'd been building up to throughout his long career. Advertisement This film is something else, though \u2014a collaboration between Maysles and co-directors Nelson Walker and Lynn True (who edited, brilliantly). None of the stuff Maysles shot over the years is in this movie: it's a one-shot project that attempts to realize his plan within a contained space and time span. The footage was shot by a team of camerapersons roaming about the train, plus a fixed camera that captured the landscapes rushing by outside. There is no indication of who shot what, though aficionados of Maysles' gently probing camerawork might have their suspicions.  All this makes \"In Transit\" a fascinating study in legacy as well as the gestalt of trains and the personalities of people who ride them. The characteristic Maysles mix of curiosity and compassion is present in every moment  of \"In Transit.\" It doesn't always feel like the films that Maysles made with and without his brother, but there are times when it does, strongly so, and there are other times when the Maysles touch is apparent even when the film is making choices that Maysles might not have made. And that's how Maysles would have wanted it, I suspect. In the second half of his life, he was as much a mentor as he was a filmmaker. Among its many virtues, \"In Transit\" is a moving tribute by students to a master who taught them how to see while encouraging their vision.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Lovers", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The first thing that really hits you about \u201cThe Lovers\u201d is not its muted color palette, ever-evocative of a smog-suffused Southern California dusk, but its musical score. A lush, romantic through line of melody, performed by a whole orchestra, with passages reminiscent of Ravel, Debussy, even Wagner. The score is by Mandy Hoffman, a longtime collaborator with this film\u2019s director, Azazel Jacobs. (There is a bit of authentic Tchaikovsky in the movie as well, and, near the end an unexpected but perfect 1980s pop hit.)  Advertisement Majestic, romantic, searching strains seem at first peculiarly incongruous with the action on screen. \u201cYou need to tell her now,\u201d an attractive middle-aged woman sitting on a bed tells a paunchy, balding, despondent-looking fellow some years older than her; his submissive response is rather less than zealous. Another couple, this one a woman in late middle age who\u2019s with a younger man, is then seen kissing by a tree near a nondescript office building; he, too, seems the more ardent one in the exchange. The older folks are Michael and Mary, played with incredible aplomb and discipline by Tracy Letts and Debra Winger. They are married, as it happens, to each other. They live in a bland split level house in a bland split level neighborhood, work bland undemanding jobs, and interact with each other with a tolerance that barely disguises, if at all, their jaw-clenched disregard for each other. Like most adulterers, they\u2019re reluctant to let the other shoe drop, or so it seems; by the same token, there\u2019s a sense they cannot wait to start new lives with their very whiny lovers. What they\u2019re waiting for, now, is a visit from their college-attending son, whom they want to tell in person. Of course neither is aware that the other is cheating.  So we believe. To tell the truth, there\u2019s a lot of ambiguity in this droll and stylized comedy \u2026 until the moment when there\u2019s no ambiguity at all. One morning, in the period when they\u2019re preparing for their son\u2019s visit, Michael and Mary go to sleep their customary way, sharing a bed but not touching. In fact they stay as far away from each other as a person in the same bed can get. But the next morning, they wake up facing each other, their heads almost touching. They open their eyes. They look at each other. They are terrified. But they decide to go off the cliff: they kiss. Then they make love. Then they\u2019re off to the races, having an affair with each other. This will eventually throw their son Joel (Tyler Ross), who has told his girlfriend Erin (Jessica Sula) how much his parents hate each other, for a major loop. But not before Michael and Mary have taken off for home during their lunch hours several times, and have left their peculiarly needy outside interests hanging at crucial moments.  There\u2019s one scene that\u2019s a particular riot. Michael is out with lover Lucy (Melora Walters), a dancer he\u2019s surprised at her ballet teaching class. He\u2019s eagerly explained to her about how much he wants to go out on a proper \u201cdate\u201d with her. First he has to make up a lie for the wife. Who is, of course, out with her whiny boyfriend Robert (Aidan Gillen). Each spouse asks about the background noise on the call, given that it\u2019s supposedly coming from the office where the spouse has to \u201cwork late.\u201d Michael spins a tale about how he stepped out for a bite; he\u2019s gone to get \u201cChinese.\u201d Mary lies back that she too has gone for \u201cChinese.\u201d Michael suggests that she do as he does and get \u201cthe duck.\u201d \u201cIf you ask me,\u201d Michael says, \u201cIt\u2019s too delicious not to share.\u201d The quality of their passion here is not just notable for its audacity but for its crassness; in their rediscovery of each other they\u2019re committing a kind of double betrayal. Which is what makes it fun for them, one suspects.  Advertisement But Jacobs\u2019 movie does not judge them, and, in fact, its myriad elements, including the music, suggest that it somehow believes in them, not in spite of their flawed character, but because of it. This is a picture with stylization that some will find off-putting, but the actors are totally in sync with it, and its through line is remarkably consistent. The languid pacing is not an arbitrary stylistic tic; it conveys a listlessness that is likely not uncommon to suburban life in Southern California. The movie\u2019s frankness about the physicality of adultery in late middle age will be much commented on, I suppose, but part of the point Jacobs seems to be making is that such things aren\u2019t worth making a big deal over. The wisdom of this meticulously crafted film is in its genuine irony, which amplifies steadily throughout until culminating in a moment of real heartbreak that, ironically enough, only sets the stage for a cycle of deceit to begin again.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Remote Area Medical", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "They drive for for hours through mountains and forests and line up days in advance, in the parking lot of Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee. They're not here to see a band or a race. They're here to see doctors and dentists who have volunteered for Remote Area Medical, a roving volunteer medical service that was founded by\u00a0Stan Brock in 1985\u00a0to help residents of the Amazon jungle. Things are as bad in the rural US as they were in thje rain forests of Brazil, where Brock once broke his leg and was informed that the nearest doctor was a 26-day journey on foot.\u00a0 Advertisement The would-be patients camped out in their cars on the outskirts of the speedway are in bad shape. They have sprains, broken bones, arthritis, skin problems. Many of them have such severe tooth decay that they can barely chew food anymore, and their significant others can no longer muster the nerve to kiss them. They haven't been to a doctor in months, years, ever. \"Have you been told before that you have a spot on your x-ray?\" a doctor asks a woman who's had her lungs photographed for the first time. \"I\u00a0never had an x-ray,\" she replies. Directed by Farihah Zaman and\u00a0Jeff Reichert\u2014a critic who writes for ReverseShot, where I've occasionally published articles\u2014\"Remote Area Medical\" is a rare contemporary documentary that is determined to tell by showing. There are no experts weighing in on the medical care crisis that's making the lives of working class and poor people measurably worse, nor are there any charts and graphs explaining how job with benefits that don't require college degrees have been drying up for decades, even as real wages fall in relation to inflation, and the cost of medical care continues to rise.\u00a0 The filmmakers get all this across by talking to people in the parking lot and inside the medical tents. A few of their subjects (including Brock) are affiliated with the organization, but most are patents, or friends and family of people who've come along to supper the patients as they wait and wait for treatment. And from these subjects, you find out all you need to know to appreciate the magnitude of what RAM is doing, and the scope of the crisis affecting the rural poor. \"We don't have jobs here, and the jobs that are available aren't paying living wages,\" one patient says. A woman tells us that her job pays so little that she regularly has to choose between paying for food, shelter or other expenses for herself and her kids\u2014a choice no person should have to make. A woman who just got a sebaceous cyst removed from her face poses for a picture with doctors, instinctively using a strand of hair to cover the spot where the cyst use to be (it's just a scar now, and she's happy to have it). She tells the filmmakers that she didn't attend her daughter's graduation because she didn't want her to be embarrassed by her mother's appearance. Another woman comes to the stadium hoping to have all of her rotting teeth pulled and replaced with dentures. She has to settle for having the five worst teeth yanked. Afterward, she weeps from shock and gratitude.\u00a0 Advertisement This is the America that the filmmakers are documenting\u2014one rarely presented in movies, and even more rarely presented without condescension.\u00a0 \"Remote Area Medical\" has a kind of artistry that might not be immediately apparent to viewers. It's of a sort last seen in the 1980s, in great theatrical documentaries shot on film, like Barbara Kopple's \"American Dream.\" Such movies upheld the traditional documentary ethos built up in the '60s, by pioneering nonfiction directors such as the Maysles brothers, D.A. Pennebaker, and Frederick Wiseman, artists who went to surprising places, interviewed or observed fascinating people, then went into the editing room and let an accumulation of data create a picture for us, rather than goosing their message with re-enactments, zippy music montages, ironically chosen bits of pop music, and storytelling devices borrowed from the world of scripted features.\u00a0 The movie's only problems are repetitiveness and length. There may not have been enough material here, dramatically speaking, to sustain a whole feature. While every individual subject is at least compelling, and some are riveting, their stories do tend to repeatedly illustrate the same points about the brokenness of the current system. The movie's focus on patients is admirable in the abstract, but after a while, you may wonder if more emphasis on doctors, nurses and organizers might have given \"Remote Area Medical\" more variety of tone or point-of-view. Nevertheless, this is an important story, elegantly told, sometimes harrowing, always affecting. There are images and people in it that you will never forget.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Moebius", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Kim Ki-Duk\u2019s \u201cMoebius,\u201d the follow-up to his Golden\r\nLion-winning \u201cPieta,\u201d takes many of the bizarre, incestuous beats of that drama\r\nand twists, contorts and morphs them into black comedy. Although many who read\r\neven the comparatively tame plot description that comes shortly in this review\r\nwill probably doubt the comedic undertones of the latest from the controversial\r\nKorean director. Trust me. Kim uses provocation through extreme imagery to\r\nsatirical ends. He wants you to squirm, be uncomfortable, and even laugh at the\r\ninsanity of what\u2019s happening on the screen. And, again, trust me, the word insanity is not an\r\nexaggeration in this case. Advertisement \u201cMoebius\u201d is a three-actor, four-character piece that plays\r\nlike Greek tragedy filtered through the lens of extreme filmmakers like Takashi\r\nMiike. As soon as one thinks that Kim has pushed the envelope narratively and\r\nvisually, he has something else disturbing up his bloody sleeve. The three\r\nentirely committed, fearless performers put through the physical and emotional\r\nmotions by Kim carry a film that is the definition of \u201cnot for everyone\u201d but \u201cMoebius\u201d\r\nworks on its terms. Its twisted, Oedipal, sadomasochistic, castrated terms. A man (Jae-hyeon Jo) is having an affair. A mother (Eun-woo\r\nLee, who also plays the mistress) knows about the affair and she\u2019s cracking in\r\nevery possible way. She confronts her husband and attempts to castrate him. She\r\nfails. So she castrates her son (Young-ju Seo) and flees the home. The father\r\nfeels such grief over his son\u2019s castration for his own sins that he becomes\r\nobsessed with trying to find ways for the young man to achieve sexual release.\r\nHis journey into the kind of Google searches that the authorities sometimes\r\ntrack results in the discovery that some people get off by rubbing stones on\r\ntheir skin until they bleed while others who have been castrated have found\r\nrelease by having knives shoved in their back and twisted around. Did I\r\nmention that dad's mistress becomes the object of sexual obsession of the son?\r\nCareful readers will note that the mistress and mother being played by the same\r\nwoman is not thematically coincidental. And then dear old crazy mom comes home\r\nand things get REALLY weird. Did I mention all of this is conveyed without a single line\r\nof dialogue? Kim\u2019s film is not a silent one a la \u201cThe Artist\u201d but a film in\r\nwhich the characters simply never speak. Oh, they make a variety of other\r\nnoises, most of them guttural. It almost feels like Kim was trying to see how\r\nmuch human suffering a filmmaker could convey without the crutch of dialogue to\r\ndo so. And so we hear groans, moans, cries, and every other sound one can\r\nimagine that doesn\u2019t include actual pronunciation.  The decision to craft \u201cMoebius\u201d as a dialogue-free piece has\r\na dual impact. First, it heightens viewer involvement as we have to lean\r\nforward, concentrate heavily on the blocking and staging to follow a story that\r\nhas no subtitles or other traditional sign markers. Second, it creates an\r\nexaggerated world like a theatrical piece that chooses movement or\r\ninterpretative dance, for example, to convey its themes instead of narrative.\r\nAnd that element adds to the black comedy aspect of \u201cMoebius\u201d\u2014this is inherently\r\nridiculous but it\u2019s made more so by no one commenting in any way through\r\ndialogue on that ridiculousness. Advertisement To say the performers in \u201cMoebius\u201d are fearless, especially\r\nEun-woo Lee, would be understating it significantly. Kim asks an amazing\r\nphysical and emotional freedom of his actors and they all deliver. We can sit\r\nback and appreciate Kim\u2019s daring work as a commentary on the way modern society\r\ndeals with sexuality, infidelity and insanity but one shouldn\u2019t ignore the very\r\npractical nature of what\u2019s happening onscreen in some of the darker moments you\u2019ll\r\nsee in a cinema this year. Kim, like a lot of great shock artists, creates a\r\nwork so intentionally button-pushing and maniacally over-the-top that it\r\ndemands your attention. He may be one of the international cinema scene's most\r\ndivisive filmmakers but no one can argue that he\u2019s going through the motions or\r\nfailing to explore the function of his demented form.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Extraordinary Tales", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda\u2019s \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d is an animated anthology\r\nfilm of Edgar Allan Poe stories narrated by luminaries like Christopher Lee,\r\nGuillermo Del Toro and even Bela Lugosi himself (using old audio footage). To\r\nbe blunt, it\u2019s kind of difficult to mess that up too much. Christopher Lee\r\nreading Edgar Allan Poe? Sign me up. Both the source material and the man\r\nreading it are legendary. And that inherent cool factor in \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d\r\ncarries the final product a very long way, although its shortcomings do\r\nsometimes force me to wonder if it could have been a masterpiece instead of a\r\nmere curiosity. As is, a few decisions made by Garc\u00eda in the filmmaking process\r\nhold \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d back from its true potential, although if it\r\nintroduces filmgoers to the works of Poe (or Lee or Lugosi, for that matter),\r\nit\u2019s done some good. Advertisement Garc\u00eda and his team animate each short film in very\r\ndifferent styles, coming back to a wraparound conversation between a raven and\r\na statue in a cemetery between shorts. It starts with the amazing \u201cThe Fall of\r\nthe House of Usher,\u201d read by Christopher Lee. The animation is surprisingly\r\nflat, looking often like a last-generation video game with too much CGI, when\r\nhand-drawn would have given this atmospheric piece more punch. However, it\u2019s\r\neasy to appreciate the budgetary freedom that animation gives Garc\u00eda with \u201cUsher,\" as\r\nthe house falls apart in a way that would have cost a studio $80 million were\r\nit live-action. In many ways, the second short story chosen is Poe\u2019s most\r\npopular and the most interestingly conceived within \u201cExtraordinary Tales.\u201d A\r\nhighly-truncated (they all are, and sometimes frustratingly so) version of \u201cThe\r\nTell-Tale Heart\u201d is told by a scratchy audio of the one-and-only Bela Lugosi,\r\naccompanied by starkly vivid animation in sharp blacks and blinding whites that\u2019s\r\nmeant to invoke famous comic artist Alberto Breccia. As a standalone piece,\r\ndespite the edits to the source, this is a fascinating bit of cinema in that it captures influences from around the world, bringing Lugosi, Poe, and Breccia\r\nunder one twisted tent.  \u201cThe Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\u201d (narrated by Julian\r\nSands), \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum\u201d (narrated by Guillermo Del Toro) and \u201cThe\r\nMasque of Red Death\u201d aren\u2019t as effective, especially the final one, which may\r\nbe the strongest visually but eschews all narration and has almost no dialogue\r\nto tell this tale only with images. I\u2019m not sure taking away the film\u2019s\r\ngreatest asset\u2014Poe\u2019s way with words\u2014was the smartest way to end the piece.  And that\u2019s a feeling I had a few too many times in \u201cExtraordinary\r\nTales\u201d\u2014wondering why Garc\u00eda made a certain visual choice, or why he cut a\r\ncertain part of Poe\u2019s stories while focusing on another (the whole thing only\r\nruns 73 minutes, when it would have benefitted by being twice as long and\r\nletting Poe\u2019s brilliance linger before jumping on to the next piece). Again,\r\nPoe\u2019s storytelling gift is so timeless, and the voice actors assembled so\r\ncaptivating, that \u201cExtraordinary Tales\u201d can\u2019t help but work on some level.

{"Title": "21 Years: Richard Linklater", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Matthew McConaughey stole Richard Linklater's second feature, \"Dazed and Confused,\" with his performance as the eternal high school stud Wooderson, so it makes a certain sense that he'd steal the documentary \"21 Years: Richard Linklater,\" a feature-length look at the director's movies that's disproportionately focused on \"Dazed.\" Ruminating on the Austin-based writer-director's oeuvre, McConaughey improvises monologues with an infectious grin, and uses his hands like a preacher or motivational speaker. The documentary runs 78 minutes, at least 15 minutes of which concern \"Dazed\"; the recent Oscar and Emmy winner tucks them into his back pocket like a tin of snuff. If nothing else, McConaughey's goofball autodidact's intensity certifies that there is, in fact, a \"Matthew McConaughey\" type of character, and that McConaughey originated it. Advertisement \"Boom! We go to set, I get my '70s Chevelle,\" the actor says, remembering the film's 1992 production in Austin, Texas. \"It's gonna be my first scene in the movie, and I'm going, 'Fuuuuuuck, here we go!', and I'm really nervous, I'm going, 'Who am, I what am I about, what's my man, what's my man, what's my man, what's my man,' and I remember in my head hearing Wooderson's voice going: 'All right, I'm about pot, rock 'n' roll, my car, and p----y.' Well, I'm high, I'm in my Chevelle, I'm listening to Nugent, and I heard 'action.'\" Later, in a section describing Linklater's calm, reflective demeanor, McConaughey says he once told the director, \"You're so Buddhist you don't even know you're Buddhist.\" Directed by Michael Dunaway and Tara Wood, \"21 Years\" does not cover every Linklater film, just highlights that keep popping up whenever the director's films are discussed. These include \"Dazed\"; \"Slacker\"; the experimental animated features \"Waking Life\" and \"A Scanner Darkly\"; \"School of Rock\"; \"Bernie\" and\u00a0\"The Newton Boys\" (in which McConaughey costarred); the remake of \"The Bad News Bears\"; and the \"Before\" films. The latter, a collaboration between Linklater and actor-writers Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, is described as the lowest grossing trilogy in cinema history. (That might or might not be true, but it's fun to say.) There's nothing about Linklater's secret magnum opus \"Boyhood,\" which was still under wraps during the filming of this documentary and is referred to only as \"the 12 year project.\" Delpy, Hawke, Jack Black, Keanu Reeves, Billy Bob Thornton and other Linklater performers talk about Linklater's film shoots, and try to illustrate his personality and interests; the filmmakers insist on illustrating their anecdotes with animated cutaways that feel redundant and sometimes desperate. (Surely Matthew McConaughey's charisma is enough to hold our attention for a minute or two, without \"help\"?)\u00a0 Linklater does not sit for any interviews. He is an absent presence. In one way, this is endearing: it suggests that Linklater either didn't want to seem self-aggrandizing, or didn't want to seem to be guiding anyone else's interpretations, including the viewers'.\u00a0But in another way, it hurts the film, because the other participants (mostly actors) lavish praise on Linklater without analyzing the technique or themes of his movies in much detail. The most insightful comments about Linklater as an artist, cultural observer, and community organizer come from Austin Chronicle founder Louis Black. He had a cameo in \"Slacker\" and has known Linklater for years, but\u00a0seems to have a\u00a0more detached point-of-view than the actors who've worked with the director at least once, and would presumably like\u00a0to again.\u00a0 Advertisement The 'tribute to an old pal\" structure makes \"21 Years\" feel less like a yeasty stand-alone theatrical feature than a shaggy dog supplement that might be packaged in a set of Linklater DVDs, or screened at a surprise birthday party for the filmmaker. It contains just enough analysis to interest those outside Linklater's personal circle, but not much more.\u00a0Interviewees wax eloquent about Linklater's fascination with subcultures and what it's like to work with him, paying special attention to his laid-back way of controlling and directing action, and his ability to help actors find the notes he wishes to them strike without being too obvious about it. If you admire Linklater, you'll enjoy this documentary, but an \"American Masters\" episode would still be preferable.

{"Title": "The Frozen Ground", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Anchorage, Alaska, circa 1983, looks and feels like a pioneer town in the Wild West in \"The Frozen Ground,\" Scott Walker's new crime thriller (and first feature). It's a town teeming with strip clubs, drug addiction, prostitution, and runaway girls whom nobody would miss if they went missing. And they do go missing, in droves. Based on the true story of Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen (played here by John Cusack), and detective Glenn Flothe (named, in the film, Jack Holcombe, and played by Nicolas Cage) who, in investigating a series of missing persons reports as well as a couple of dead girls dug up by animals out in the wilderness, starts to wonder if all of these events aren't somehow connected.  Advertisement \"The Frozen Ground\" trucks in cliche, as most serial killer and police procedural films do, but the strength of the acting (from the leads down to people with only one or two lines) helps ground the film. Filmed in a frenetic style, with gigantic moving frenzied closeups, and an almost total lack of establishing shots, \"The Frozen Ground\" is best when it lands, and stays, on the faces of the leads: Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, and Vanessa Hudgens.  When we are looking at their faces, we don't need to be reminded of the stakes.  They're there in plain view. It's hard to do something new in the serial killer genre, especially since the field is so over-saturated, from the 24/7 Investigation Discovery channel to \"Criminal Minds\"'s weekly obsession with how dangerous it is to be a woman because one minute you're walking down the street, minding your own business, the next minute you're chained up in a dungeon. All of those familiar elements are here. Jack Holcombe even has a resentful wife (Radha Mitchell), complaining to her husband about how hard he works, before doing an unmotivated about-face in a later scene. Why do movies so rarely know what to do with wives of workaholics?  Why are they usually given the role of nag, before coming around in the final hour?\u00a0 But \"The Frozen Ground\" is not trying to re-invent the wheel, and it also isn't trying to imitate \"Seven\" or \"Silence of the Lambs.\" It is interested in Holcombe's increasingly urgent investigation, and the pushback he receives from higher-ups who don't want to re-open what were considered to be closed cases. There's one shot of Nicolas Cage sitting in a dark office, staring up at a bulletin board, covered with snapshots of missing women. That one shot establishes so much: his feeling of urgency, the sense of how huge this thing could be if anyone could find the missing links, and the loneliness of his quest.  Advertisement Robert Hansen's name may not be as well-known as Ted Bundy, or John Wayne Gacy, but his murderous spree in 1970s and 1980s Alaska puts him in the Serial Killer Pantheon. Despite a troubled and violent background with tons of red flags, Hansen was able to maneuver undetected in Anchorage for many years, abducting young women, raping them, taking them via private plane out into the inaccessible wilderness surrounding Anchorage and then hunting them like game. He was married, with kids.  He worked as a baker.  People liked him, but he was quiet and kept to himself. He had a great cover persona, as most of these characters do.  Flothe finally got a warrant to search Hansen's house, and found an aviation map covered with X's, to mark the spot of his burial grounds.  Many of the victims were never found.  We'll never know the number of women he actually killed.  Hansen was sentenced to 461 years in prison with no possibility of parole.  Cindy Paulson (Vanessa Hudgens) is the teenage prostitute who managed to escape from Hansen's clutches, and went to the police to tell her story.  She was not believed, because of her background.  This is handled in a manner bordering on vaudeville, with one cop regaling a group of cops with the contemptuous comment, \"I mean, how can a prostitute be raped?\" They all laugh in agreement.  This is not to say that such situations do not happen in police stations all the time, but the scene feels heavy-handed. The scenes between Nicolas Cage and Vanessa Hudgens are the film's best.  Nicolas Cage is so grounded here, so real and simple. The whole film really hinges on Holcombe trying to make Cindy trust him so that she will testify and be a reliable witness, and this is where Cage shines. His entire performance is about two things only: thinking and listening. He has a power of listening that is totally authentic, and he is quite generous to his young co-star. He is not concerned with himself, because Jack Holcombe isn't either. He listens to Cindy talk on a level that could be described as subterranean, with a cop's instinct for what isn't being said. Advertisement And Cindy is, to put it mildly, a handful. She has a pimp (played by 50 Cent, who also is one of the producers of the film), but things have gone south in that relationship. She wanders up and down the \"Ho Stroll\" in Anchorage, and gets a job dancing in a strip club. She does coke and crystal meth.  She has nowhere to live, and stands on the sidewalk in the driving snow. (There is a breathtaking scene that has nothing to do with anything else, where Cindy, alone on a deserted side street, comes across a gigantic moose, which has wandered into the city. Moose and Cindy stand for a while, staring at each other. The snow falls. It is a moment that is beyond meaning, beyond plot, reminiscent of the encounter with the deer on the railroad tracks at dawn in \"Stand By Me.\") John Cusack dials the burner down low, a smart choice, giving the character the guy-next-door persona which was so much a part of Hansen's successful M.O. When we see him in the flashbacks, with one of the girls he abducted (Gia Mantegna, in a gut-wrenching performance), he is calm, almost taciturn, even when he punches her in the head. He's almost kind and supportive with his victims, telling them they are \"good girls.\" Cusack has placed his voice at a very interesting part of his register, making him sound (and seem) benign. It's a voice that almost isn't there. He is a hunter, a predator. He has worked hard at his camouflage. Mixed in with the super fast hand-held action of the majority of the film are periodic aerial shots (Patrick Murguia is the cinematographer) of the forbidding Alaskan wilderness, mountains, glaciers, frozen rivers. These shots are constant reminders of what a vast field Hansen had to play in, and the impossibility of ever finding the missing.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Self/less", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Filmmakers have struggled with the definition of what it\r\nmeans to be a human being for decades. Are you merely a product of flesh and\r\nbone? Do you believe there\u2019s a soul? Or is your mind the most definitive aspect\r\nof your existence? From Rod Serling to \u201cSeconds\u201d to silly body switch movies\r\nlike \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the consideration of the human body as a shell, one that\r\ncan house a persona other than your own, has fascinated some of our most\r\ncreative voices. And when it was announced that a visually striking and\r\nphilosophically ambitious filmmaker like Tarsem Singh (\u201cThe Fall\u201d) was going to\r\nwade into these waters himself, there was reason for notable optimism. Which\r\nmakes the result, \u201cSelf/less,\u201d all the more frustrating. \"Self/less\" is a bland, generic\r\nproduct that almost defiantly refuses to explore the complex issues which it\r\nraises, perhaps in an effort to appeal to a wider audience. The narrative outline\r\nof \u201cSelf/less\u201d is a philosophical theme park, readymade for daring, complex\r\nfilmmaking. And Singh and his writers never go on any of the rides. Advertisement Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is an uber-wealthy New York\r\nbusinessman, the kind who appears to have chosen to cover his entire, lavish\r\napartment in gold one day, simply because he was bored. Sadly, all the wealth\r\nin the world cannot defeat the cancer that\u2019s killing him, nor can it reunite a\r\nbitter man with an estranged daughter (Michelle Dockery). Hale receives a\r\nmysterious business card that promises him a future that his body cannot. He\r\nmeets with an obviously nefarious scientist/CEO named Albright (Matthew Goode),\r\nwho tells Hale about \u201cshedding,\u201d a process that allows someone to discard their\r\nbroken body for a new, genetically grown one, for a cost of only $250 million.\r\nHale signs up. After going through a visually dull process (and here\u2019s\r\nwhere you start to wonder why Tarsem didn\u2019t make different aesthetic choices,\r\nand not for the last time), Hale wakes up in the body of Ryan Reynolds. He\u2019s\r\ngiven a new name\u2014Edward\u2014and relocated to New Orleans, where life appears to be\r\nexactly what he wanted. He drives a fast car, plays basketball, and even makes\r\na new friend (Derek Luke). The one hitch is that Edward has to take a little\r\nred pill at the same time every day or risk hallucinations, migraines and even\r\ndeath. After missing just one pill, Edward has a detailed hallucination that\r\nfeels more like a flashback, and discovers that this body was not grown in a\r\nlab. It belonged to a family man who sacrificed himself to pay for treatments\r\nto save his daughter\u2019s life. He finds Edward\u2019s family, including an\r\nexpectedly-startled wife played by Natalie Martinez, and learns the truth about\r\nhis new life, a truth that Albright and his suited cronies will do anything to\r\nkeep secret. Clearly, this is thematically dense stuff, from the way the 1% uses\r\nthe desperate needs of the poor to their own advantage to a reliance on\r\npharmaceuticals to stay happy and alive. Yet every time \u201cSelf/less\u201d feels\r\nlike it\u2019s going to actually explore one of those themes and give them more than\r\nlip service as plot details, it pulls back to standard, genre fare, both narratively and visually. \u201cSelf/less\u201d\r\nis one of those depressing affairs that gets less and less interesting as it\r\nprogresses. The opening scenes of opulence in Hale\u2019s penthouse have a strong\r\nvisual aesthetic\u2014empty rooms like empty minds waiting to be filled\u2014but that\r\ndisappears in the seemingly neverending second act, during which \u201cSelf/less\u201d\r\nsags and never recovers, feeling at times more like a failed cable TV pilot than a film. With its hallucinations, questions of identity, and philosophical\r\nresonance, it\u2019s simply inexplicable that \u201cSelf/less\u201d becomes as visually\r\nengaging as a \u201cCSI\u201d spin-off. Perhaps Tarsem was reined in by producers who\r\ndidn\u2019t want their \u201cRyan Reynolds Vehicle\u201d to become \u201cArtsy,\u201d but they made a\r\nfatal error. At 116 minutes, and with a narrative that telegraphs every twist a\r\nhalf-hour before it arrives, \u201cSelf/less\u201d needed a visual language that it just\r\ndoesn\u2019t have. Advertisement And that lack of personality isn\u2019t replaced by anything.\r\nReynolds isn\u2019t bad but he seems to have been directed to play Edward just a\r\ntick north of bland, which isn\u2019t exactly his strong suit. Someone here needed\r\nto realize that a movie this conceptually crazy needed to be fun. Movies like \u201cFace/Off\u201d\r\nare enjoyably ridiculous in large part due to the fact that Nicolas Cage, John\r\nTravolta and John Woo KNEW they were ridiculous, laughing and winking at the\r\naudience throughout. \u201cSelf/less\u201d is played on a straight line, never nearly as\r\nmuch fun as it could or should have been.

{"Title": "Baywatch", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "If you\u2019re like me, you laughed at the trailers for \u201cBaywatch,\u201d the feature-film comedy sendup of/homage to the cheesy lifeguarding adventure TV series. That show featured quasi-hunk David Hasselhoff and bodacious babe Pamela Anderson plucking bodies from water and solving crimes, something that was not really their bailiwick\u2014a point that this movie at first pokes fun at, and then belabors into unfunniness. But let me not get ahead of myself.  The trailers were funny enough to make me look forward to the picture. Imagine my displeasure when confronted with the nearly two-hour full feature, in which the trailer jokes were no longer funny; a full feature with a storyline that an enterprising six-year-old might have thought was a little too rudimentary. (The fact that the storyline was concocted by Thomas Lennon and David Ben Garant, the hipster hacks who have in fact written a book about how to make big dollars in Hollywood by writing utter crap screenplays, could be said to add insult to injury were both injury and insult not totally predictable.)  Advertisement How is it, you might ask, that the trailer jokes are funnier than what is in the movie? Well at least one joke from the trailer isn\u2019t in the movie. And as for the rest, the answer lies in the fact that this is another one of those raunchy comedies that\u2019s barely a movie, that looks like it was edited by dumping a bunch of footage into whatever movie-cutting software they\u2019re using and hitting \u201crandomize.\u201d The number of out-of-continuity shots in the first 20 minutes was so large I stopped counting.  The movie begins with Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Mitch Buchannon, head lifeguard of Baywatch, running around his beach, reaffirming his supremacy. Tryouts for positions on his team are tomorrow, and today a few of the new recruits introduce themselves. One is Ronnie (Jon Bass), the tubby, nerdy tech guy with a thing for always-running-in-slo-mo Baywatch hottie CJ (Kelly Rohrbach). His thing is such that it causes him some physical discomfort in a long, drawn-out, unfunny \u201cstuck junk\u201d bit half adapted from \u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary.\u201d Another candidate is Alexandra Daddario\u2019s Summer, who will be the slo-mo brunette to CJ\u2019s blonde. (Ilfenesh Hadera is Stephanie, the most authoritative female of the crew.) The guy who headquarters says must be included is disgraced Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (Zac Efron), who\u2019s getting on the crew in a combination of publicity stunt and community service. Mitch is not too happy about this. His name-calling of Matt (which does include the sobriquet \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d) is one of the few running bits that manage to raise a smile.  After all the characters are introduced, we cut to the next day\u2019s tryouts, at which Ronnie and Summer prove their mettle, and Matt goes head-to-head with Mitch. And after this scene, the movie injects an \u201care you looking at my boobs\u201d exchange between Summer and Matt, in which the characters are wearing the costumes they had on in their introductory scenes taking place the day before. As they used to say on \u201cMystery Science Theater 3000,\u201d \u201cThey just didn\u2019t care.\u201d  Which may still have you asking, how does this affect the jokes? Well, in the trailer there\u2019s one isolated bit in which Efron\u2019s character stands gloating on a yacht deck, saying \u201cJason Bourne ain\u2019t got nothing on me.\u201d Only he doesn\u2019t get to the last word, because a bad guy behind him knocks him out. Funny in the trailer, because it\u2019s cut to hit on a certain beat, and it does. In the movie, they use a completely different take of the line and the shot\u2014it\u2019s a tighter perspective from a low angle, with a little anamorphic distortion\u2014and there\u2019s no breathing room before Efron makes his proclamation, so the line falls flat.  Advertisement It kind of goes that way throughout the movie. Which also features long periods of too-sincere homilies about teamwork, weirdly gratuitous brutality (one innocuous character is subjected to a grotesquely grisly death) and an extended corpse-penis joke which, in the dishonorable tradition of \u201cDirty Grandpa,\u201d subjects a character played by Zac Efron to humiliation in a way that\u2019s not even stealthily homophobic. On the plus side, the movie has a pervading air of crass amiability about it\u2014it\u2019s almost like a two-hour end-credits gag reel. (Nevertheless, it contains an end credits gag reel.) But as I said, if you saw the trailer, you got the best the movie has to offer.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Breathe", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Teenage girls yearn to connect. It's an impulse that is so strong that if one is left outside the charmed circle of belonging the whole world can fall apart. It's like being banished from a very powerful cult. Who you are depends on how you are perceived. Betrayal and manipulation, occurring beneath parental notice, is savage. M\u00e9lanie Laurent's second feature, \"Breathe,\" based on a popular YA novel, understands the addictive sensations of a new friendship, its thrilling swing into merging, and its dizzying plunge into hurt and rage. It's a confident and scary film. Advertisement When Sarah (Lou de La\u00e2ge) first appears in school, she carries with her the self-aware glamour of the \"new girl.\" She ingratiates herself immediately with everyone in school by whispering the correct answer to a kid stumped at the blackboard in math class. She smokes cigarettes from Nigeria and talks about her mother who works for an NGO in Africa. In gym class, she leaps onto the balance beam, standing suspended in the air, with one leg stretched out behind her, a vision of stillness and self-confidence. In the pack-mentality of high school, Sarah is an individual. It's seductive. Shy asthmatic Charlie (Jos\u00e9phine Japy) is thrilled when Sarah seems to choose hervas a best friend. Charlie's home life is upsetting. Her parents (Isabelle Carr\u00e9 and Radivoje Bukvicon) are so engrossed in breaking up, getting back together and then breaking up again, that they barely pay her any attention. Charlie and Sarah spend hours on the phone together, sneaking cigarettes in the school bathroom, going out dancing, their involvement so hermetically sealed that it is as though no one exists on the planet but the two of them. There are danger signs early on. Sarah, with a breezy air of plausible deniability, drives a wedge between Charlie and her childhood friend Victoire (Roxane Duran). Watch how she does it during a scene when the three of them walk home from school. You almost can't catch her at it. Then, on a weekend trip with Charlie's family, Sarah pursues the guy interested in Charlie's mother. There's something ruthless about it. De La\u00e2ge is riveting all around, but is most compelling in those moments when she is not the center of attention. She goes entirely flat, waiting, waiting for the spotlight to turn her way again. Once the equilibrium is destabilized, Charlie starts to flail. Instead of backing off, she clings. Both have something the other wants. The gaps in personality, confidence, circumstance, are filled by the all-encompassing presence of the other.\u00a0 Advertisement The film takes off once the honeymoon period is over. The real strength of \"Breathe\" is in the fact that Sarah is not villainized, although her behavior is often monstrous. Of course, she has secrets: her breezy conversation about her awesome selfless mother would be clocked by an FBI profiler as nonsense in about 2 seconds. Perhaps her lies are a survival mechanism. She eventually experiences Charlie's interest in her as intrusive, even though she had courted Charlie like a \"mark\" from the get-go.\u00a0 Details interest Laurent as a director: the silences, the body language, the collage-aspect to teenage life (classes, homework, parents, parties, phone calls). Events are presented in isolated images: Charlie playing knock-hockey with friends; whispering on the phone with Sarah; Sarah and Charlie wandering through a field the air golden and peaceful. The story is linear (unlike the book, which is told in flashback), but the style is fragmentary, deceptively casual. There are a couple of stand-out shots, the most stunning being a long tracking-shot along the exterior of a building, where we see Sarah's home life through the windows as the camera passes by. Charlie's rage at being left out of Sarah's warm glow has resulted in stalker-like behavior, and that shot is a disturbing representation of it.\u00a0 Japy, at first, seems to have the more cliched wallflower role. But there are details in the performance that show us otherwise: her deadpan expression as she approaches her unhappy home, the sense that rage is there in her, rage she has no idea how to handle. Being rejected by Sarah doesn't exactly bring out an \"I won't be ignored, Dan\" reaction, but it's close. She wants answers: Why is she \"out\" now? What did she do? Self-loathing is irresistible. de La\u00e2ge shows a masterful understanding of a fragile girl who has created a persona that works for her, helps her navigate. She is narcissistic and depends on the attention of others. She's brutal, but she can also be vulnerable, supportive and fun. Advertisement Watching events unfold is almost a despairing experience, bringing up feelings of \"Why can't they work it out?\", with the corollary being \"Why can't girls stop doing this to each other?\" Margaret Atwood's novel \"Cat's Eye\"\u00a0is one of the most accurate portrayals of the viciousness of little girls, viciousness that is invisible to authority figures, and \"Breathe\" is in that pantheon. Women look at one another and know the score. The response can be one of empathy (\"Oh my God, you do that too?\") or it can be one of rejection (\"You're like that, but I'm NOT.\") Sarah's cutting observations on Charlie's behavior have truth in them, hurtful though they may be. Charlie does need to let it go. But Sarah gave her something she wanted, belonging, importance. She wants it back. The fact that Sarah has played her like a violin is incomprehensible to Charlie.\u00a0 Cinema is filled with stories of intense and manipulative female friendships, friendships that sometimes tip over into folie a deux situations like \"Heavenly Creatures\" or \"Don't Deliver Us From Evil\". Women will stab you in the back. Women will steal your husband. Women will start gossip campaigns to destroy your reputation. Laurent knows all that, but never lets her story derail into cliche. This is well-observed stuff, the hysteria of a new friendship, and the moments when the abyss opens up, yawning underneath what once seemed perfect.", "Critic": "Alpha"}

Three young men rent a hotel room with the sole purpose of bringing back women for sex, which they would record and turn into amateur porn. One of their targets, a shy girl named Lily, turns out to be a winged creature who rips their genitals off and murders them. Classic horror movie lessons: don\u2019t be an asshole and don\u2019t underestimate the quiet girl. Expanded into a full-length feature in this week\u2019s \u201cSiREN,\u201d any such message is muddled by a script that has no idea what it\u2019s saying or doing, and a director who can\u2019t grasp the right tone. The centerpiece of \u201cSiREN\u201d needs to be a descent into Hell that the filmmakers here seem incapable of really taking, resulting in a film that\u2019s totally strange in concept but rather straightforward in execution. It's a movie lost somewhere in the middle: too weird to be believable, not weird enough to be memorable. Advertisement Jonah (Chase Williamson) is getting married and it\u2019s that time in a young man\u2019s life when the bachelor party becomes a pressing concern. His brother has been put in charge of trying to plan the most memorable evening possible, which appears to include booze, strippers and shrooms. However, it looks like the night is going to be a bust when they end up at a hole-in-the-wall strip club that produces more sadness than ecstasy. Just as they\u2019re about to call it a night, a mysterious stranger offers to take them to a private establishment, the likes of which they\u2019ve only heard about in urban legends. Of course, while the boys are excited at the prospect of finding the orgy house from \u201cEyes Wide Shut,\u201d horror movie viewers know something more akin to \u201cHostel\u201d or \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d is on the night\u2019s schedule. The centerpiece of \u201cSiREN\u201d is, of course, at the underground strip club, which quickly reveals itself to have a supernatural side. Sure, the bodyguards in masks are creepy enough, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the strippers with scales or the live torture show happening in the corner of the room. And wait until the establishment\u2019s proprietor Mr. Nyx (Justin Welborn) gets you backstage, where things get really weird. Mr. Nyx is a collector of the odd and the supernatural, including a young lady named Lily (Hannah Fierman), who is behind glass like so many adult performer establishments. But this is more to protect the client than the stripper. And Lily doesn\u2019t so much dance for our groom-to-be as she sings, a siren song of course, that enchants him in such a way that he decides he must save Lily, convinced she\u2019s being sexually trafficked. He sets her free, and she begins a night of carnage, spurred on by the fact that she\u2019s now in love with Jonah. Yes, \u201cSiREN\u201d could be read as a cautionary tale against freeing sexual prisoners, but let\u2019s not get into that. There are times when \u201cSiREN\u201d approaches the WTF insanity it needs throughout in order to work. There\u2019s a sequence shortly after Lily\u2019s escape in which the boys, realizing that she is a genital-ripping creature of the night, try to flee the club, and it\u2019s borderline inept in its construction but hints at the movie this could have been, more of a tongue-in-cheek journey to the dark side than the filmmakers seem capable of delivering. As is, \u201cSiREN\u201d just isn\u2019t odd enough. It\u2019s a movie about implanted memories, a stripper with a tail, and winged creatures, but it doesn\u2019t have the personality to make any of that interesting, despite game performances from Welborn and Fierman.  I guess the moral of the story is if you\u2019re going to make a weird movie, go all in. Don\u2019t hesitate. Don\u2019t hold back. Horror movie watchers will take the journey with you. Despite its inherent ridiculousness and winged title character, \u201cSiREN\u201d never gets off the ground. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "By Sidney Lumet", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Sidney Lumet made 44 films in 50 years. That kind of prodigious output would be impressive even if he was merely turning out for-hire studio work, but any film buff worth a conversation knows that\u2019s not the case with Lumet, who not only made films for five decades but made films that mattered. Famous for a social conscience reflected in films like \u201c12 Angry Men,\u201d \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d and \u201cRunning on Empty,\u201d Lumet was also a consummate \u201cactor\u2019s director\u201d and an underrated craftsman. I was honored to be asked to appear on the Director\u2019s Club podcast earlier this year in an episode devoted to the man, which allowed for a marathon of rewatches of a dozen or so of Lumet\u2019s films, and the scope of his talent remains breathtaking, from his first film to his last. So how could a movie possibly capture that vast of a career in only 100 minutes? Nancy Buirski\u2019s \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d is a gift to fans of the art of film directing. It is beautifully constructed, not as a chronological biography of a directorial legend but as a thematic exploration of his work. Comprised mostly of an interview conducted just a few years before his death, \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d won\u2019t just make you want to revisit his works but reappreciate the role of a great director in cinema. Advertisement Given the breadth of his accomplishments, it may come as a surprise how often a very humble Lumet speaks of luck. He recognizes how much of his best work came about because of the right contributions from the right people at the right time. All art has a degree of blessed coincidence, and it\u2019s surprising how much Lumet begins the film discussing this element of his career, such as when he was tapped to direct \u201c12 Angry Men.\u201d He also speaks at length about his upbringing in Yiddish theater, and a strict father, who was also an actor. Buirski works thematically in the construction of her film\u2014for example, she\u2019ll go from a story about Lumet\u2019s father to a scene from \u201cDaniel\u201d or \u201cRunning on Empty,\u201d illustrating how Lumet\u2019s life experience influenced his filmography. By avoiding the so-typical construction of chronological biography, Buirski gets at something much deeper: the \u201cchapter\u201d of Lumet\u2019s life about his father didn\u2019t end when his dad passed but was reflected throughout his career, all the way to the dynamic between Philip Seymour Hoffman and Albert Finney in \u201cBefore the Devil Knows You\u2019re Dead.\u201d  \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d doesn\u2019t skimp on technical or filmmaking anecdotes as well. One of my favorite films of all time, \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d sparks a discussion of color palettes, and how he purposefully didn\u2019t use one in that movie to keep it as realistic as possible. As he says, the worst-case scenario would be for the audience to not identify with Al Pacino\u2019s character because he was gay, so he had to ground the film as realistically as possible visually to amplify the commonality. To that end, there was no costume design. Everyone wore their own clothes. Buirski also doesn\u2019t shy away from showing extended clips, including a scene with Pacino to serve as an example of the truth of his performance, one of my favorites of all time. Clearly, I\u2019m a Lumet fan, so here\u2019s where I have to step back and wonder if \u201cBy Sidney Lumet\u201d would work for those who aren\u2019t. While the thematic assembly is invigorating for those of us who know his career and biography chronologically, it may be off-putting or even frustrating for more casual fans. And sometimes it does feel like the balance can be slightly out of whack. It\u2019s well over an hour before we get to anything related to \u201cNetwork,\u201d \u201cPrince of the City\u201d or \u201cThe Verdict,\u201d and one could easily do a full documentary on those three films alone. For non-Lumet fans, it may be too much of one thing. For Lumet fans, it may be not enough of his best work. It\u2019s impossible to capture every facet of a career as vast and influential as Lumet\u2019s in one interview documentary, and I would argue that Buirski isn\u2019t really trying to do that. She doesn\u2019t speak to collaborators of Lumet\u2019s or those influenced by him. This is not that film. It is a conversation, one of the last of its type, with a master filmmaker. Personally, I wish we had more of them. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}

From the beginning, \u201cThe World of Kanako\u201d is designed in a\r\nway to be unsettling. The opening scenes with close-ups of sweaty faces\r\nspurting lines like \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d set the dual themes of\r\nthe piece\u2014love and violence\u2014but they do so in a way that\u2019s discomforting.\r\nThere\u2019s a sense of displacement and confusion, especially for the first act,\r\nthat\u2019s not unlike a late night in a club. You barely hear snippets of\r\nconversation over the loud music, and Fujishima and editor Yoshiyuki Koike don\u2019t\r\nhold a shot for more than a few seconds. Even scenes of dialogue between two\r\nrelatively normal characters\u2014like when Fujishima is talking to Kanako\u2019s\r\nclassmates or her doctor\u2014are cut together from several angles.  Advertisement At first, Fujishima feels just like a straightforward anti-hero,\r\nthe bad cop trying to do one last good thing, but that interpretation changes\r\nrelatively quickly. He\u2019s not a hero. He\u2019s the kind of guy who, while staying\r\nwith her to help find his daughter, rapes and beats his ex-wife. He picks up a\r\nhooker who he drunkenly calls his daughter\u2019s name. Yakusho is fearless, playing\r\nmost of the film hunched over, bloody and sweaty like a man who has literally\r\ntaken himself to the brink of death and no longer cares what happens to him. It\u2019s\r\nsuch a daring performance that it makes the violence of the piece more visceral\r\nbecause we believe this man is capable of surviving anything and doing anything\r\nto get his daughter back. There\u2019s a parking garage shoot-out/stab-out that\r\nneeds to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s \u201cOldboy\u201d-claw-hammer-scene insane. Admittedly, I grew tired of the nihilism of \u201cThe World of\r\nKanako\u201d long before it was over, and I have a high tolerance for that sort of\r\nthing, so that has to be taken into account when assessing the overall product,\r\nbut the quality of the filmmaking never flags. You just have to ask yourself if\r\nthe journey to this ridiculously violent world, however well-constructed, is one worth taking.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Goodbye to All That", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The southern-based playwright and screenwriter Angus Maclachlan makes his film\u00a0directorial debut with this disarming sex comedy about a fellow named Otto whose\u00a0hapless inattention to certain salient details of his existence leads to the breakup of his\u00a0marriage. Otto, played with sly charm and vulnerability by Paul Schneider, is so in the\u00a0moment that he tends to discount how a given moment might do some damage, as when\u00a0he crushes his foot tooling around in a dune buggy with his nine-year-old daughter.\u00a0Later on, that daughter, Edie (Audrey P. Scott, who\u2019s wonderful), tells her mom Annie\u00a0(Melanie Lynskey), how she\u2019s been praying for her dad, because she \u201cwants God to be\u00a0nice to him.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement Annie doesn\u2019t feel like being super-nice to him; soon, with the help of a very take-charge\u00a0therapist, Annie informs Otto that \u201cthe marriage is over\u201d and Otto is soon out on his own.\u00a0Upon learning of the affair that prompted Annie\u2019s action, Otto returns to the dating pool\u00a0and is both bemused and frustrated to learn that love interests both old and new, played\u00a0by an array of attractive actresses that go from Heather Graham to Anna Camp to Ashley\u00a0Hinshaw to Heather Lawless, are largely interested in falling into bed with him and not\u00a0much else.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of good awkward fun to be had as the viewer simultaneously laughs\u00a0at Otto\u2019s expense and hopefully commiserates a bit with him. Particularly hilarious\u00a0and cringeworthy is a scene of a nude sit between Otto and young, lissome Mildred\u00a0(Hinshaw), who\u2019s very into chat prior to sexual activity. \u201cI like that you have calluses on\u00a0the palms of your hands,\u201d Mildred coos to Otto, and the look on Schneider\u2019s face as he\u00a0regards his distinctly un-callused palms (the guy works as a web designer, for heaven\u2019s\u00a0sake) is priceless. The movie is replete with little eccentric touches of behavior, dialogue\u00a0and performance. It\u2019s in a totally different register than the two prior Maclachlan\u00a0pictures I\u2019ve seen, the affectionate and quirky Southern family drama \u201cJunebug\u201d (2005,\u00a0directed by Phil Morrison) and the intense spiritual allegory \u201cStone\u201d (2010, directed\u00a0by John Curran). There\u2019s almost a sense of male wish-fulfillment in the parade of truly\u00a0luminous women who come into Otto\u2019s life, but this makes the humor of their subsequent\u00a0eccentricities that much more potent, as in Camp\u2019s sexual super-freak who, after an\u00a0intense bout with both Otto and a sex toy quietly avers \u201cI wanna read my Bible.\u201d\u00a0 Otto\u00a0and Maclachlan seem to embody the same attitude towards women: affection and nearly\u00a0awe-filled respect combined with a certain amused exasperation. It\u2019s slightly ironic that\u00a0by then end of this concise film\u2019s story arc, the most ostensibly sane of Otto\u2019s romances\u00a0makes him the most outlandish proposition, to which Otto replies: \u201cCan I?\u201d Whether he\u00a0can and whether he does is addressed in the movie\u2019s coda, and movie lovers looking for\u00a0an unusual, quirky, regionally sensitive (autumn in North Carolina has never looked more\u00a0appealing in a film) will enjoy taking the brisk, entertaining journey to the place of Otto\u2019s\u00a0resolution.

{"Title": "The Girl and Death", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"The Girl and Death\" is a pretty blunt title, and an evocative one as well, recalling as it does, you know, that Schubert string quartet \"Death and The Maiden.\" Although this movie\u2019s music is mostly Chopin, with a little Gounod. Dutch director Jos Stelling, who also co-wrote the picture, knows how to prepare his audience, I guess. His movie is as somber, and redolent of Old Europe, as its title seems to promise. It is also as, for lack of a better or happier word, conventional.Meticulously conceived, handsomely shot (by Goert Giltay), sincerely enacted by an able and largely attractive cast, \"The Girl and Death\" is also the sort of movie in which one character will say \"Love destroys everything; love is an illusion\" to another character mere seconds after the two characters are introduced. The movie begins some time in an unspecified past, as an old distinguished man with a volume of Pushkin visits an abandoned hotel; it flashes back to his first visit there. He is Nikolai, a Russian on his way to Leipzig to make his fortune, and upon stopping in for the night he finds himself enchanted by young Elise, who is one of several courtesans who inhabit the premises. Nina, the \"love is an illusion\" chippie, tries to warn off poor Nik, who is soon subjected not just to the torment of love but to the humiliations of the hateful, old, fake nobleman who \"owns\" and abuses Elise. The two star-crossed lovers make sacrifices for each other that, alas, the other in each case can not be privy to; the misunderstandings arising from these circumstances create a very unpleasant scene after Nikolai returns from his successful fortune hunting to give the fake nobleman what for. And so on. These plot twists and turns do recall the narrative poetry of Pushkin, whose rakes were raked over the coals by fate, but Stelling seems uninterested in aspiring to the wit that animated Pushkin\u2019s irony; his vision is pure mordancy only leavened by a wispy romanticism that recalls the likes of \"Elvira Madigan.\" In this respect, leading lady Sylvia Hoeks, delicate-featured and with a strong screen presence, provides the movie with much-needed oomph. But it\u2019s not enough to rescue the movie from its own complacency. \"The Girl And Death\" seems entirely resigned in its depiction of a world in which men of wealth and power trade in human souls for sexual satisfaction, and younger men rage at the injustice of it all until they acquire their own wealth and power and become as blind and petty as those they once despised. It soaks in its depression as if in a warm bath. Movies made over fifty years ago by the likes of Max Ophuls were more animated, more angry, more radical in their critiques of such injustice. So watch \"Letter From An Unknown Woman\" before you even think of checking this out, is my advice to you.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Prince Avalanche", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Prince Avalanche\" is the perfect end to a long summer of computer-generated spectaculars, a film in which there are only two special effects: natural beauty and human emotion.\u00a0 The beauty comes from the setting: a section of landscape near Bastrop, Texas, that was scorched by wildfire. The emotion comes from the film's main characters, Alvin (Paul Rudd) and his brother-in-law Lance (Emile Hirsch), who've been hired to repair land and roads. They paint yellow lanes on blacktop, mulch\u00a0gardens consumed by flame, and inspect ruined homes. They kid each other as men do, keeping it light when they aren't sniping at each other.\u00a0 Advertisement These early scenes are pleasant yet tense because we know what sort of movie this is\u2014a male bonding drama that must eventually erupt into pained confrontation. When the confrontations arrive, though, the pain doesn't feel like an obligatory story beat, because we've grown to know and love these characters.\u00a0 At first this seems very much a mentor-pupil sort of relationship, with Rudd's Alvin as the steady, smart, capable family man, and Hirsch's Lance as the city kid who can't stand being out in nature for longer than a few hours.\u00a0The film's writer and director David Gordon Green adapted this movie from the 2011 Icelandic drama \"Either Way,\" and there's a touch of European style intimate-splendor to it. Swaths of flaming trees evoke the opening montage of \"Apocalypse Now.\" There are images of burros grazing on wildflowers, a bird pinwheeling above a line of trees, a green caterpillar inching over the top of a mossy log, yellow paint spilling into a stony riverbed, and so forth. The original score, by Explosions in the Sky, creates a trancelike feel, occasionally pushing too hard, to the point where it feels as though you're watching the dollar-store version of \"Koyaanisquatsi.\"\u00a0 But most of the picture has a contemplative, at times deliberately pokey groove. There may in fact not be quite enough story to support a feature\u2014Green told RogerEbert.com's Simon Abrams that the shooting script ran about 65 pages\u2014but this is clearly not one of those films that loses sleep over whether every second is propulsive. In fact a large part of its worth lies in how opposed it is to the values that modern commercial films tend to prize.\u00a0 This is the sort of movie that lets its two main characters spend their first few screen minutes waking up from an overnight camp, trudging uphill towards pink dawn light with shovels on their shoulders, laying yellow paint-lines on pavement, and so forth, while saying barely a word. The film reveals character through nonverbal details of gesture, framing and production design (such as when the paint-striper rolls out of frame, followed by Lance's road-crew-inappropriate brown suede shoes).\u00a0 There's banter about the men's \"equal time boombox agreement\" and chatter that reveals backstory. We get the sense that Alvin's out here not in spite of his home situation, but because of it, and that Lance is neither the freewheeling stud nor the lazy lout that Alvin seems to think he is. Lance knows things about Alvin's wife (Lance's sister) that are better left unspoken, not because they reflect poorly on her, but because addressing them might puncture Alvin's image of himself. Lance has his own blind spots. His constant droning about his pickup artistry is annoying, then pathetic, then oddly charming, because it clearly doesn't match up with who he actually is. (When he tells Alvin he's going to try his luck at a beauty pageant because he's got \"like, an eighty to ninety percent success rate at those places,\" Alvin replies, \"Somehow, in your mind, you truly do perceive yourself as a gentleman.\") Advertisement The movie made me think of one of my favorite films of the '90s, one not many people have seen: Tom Gilroy's \"Spring Forward,\" starring Liev Schrieber as a young ex-con and Ned Beatty as an older man who works in Connecticut state parks with him. Like that picture, \"Prince Avalanche\" feels like a stage play transplanted to the screen\u2014there are only three major characters, the third of whom is an old truck driver (Lance LeGault) who periodically hangs out with them\u2014and it tries to balance matter-of-fact exposition with quasi-mythological meanings. It's the sort of film in which \"We've got a lot of lines to paint, and it's a very long road\" is clearly about more than it seems to be about. For the most part, though, \"Prince Avalanche\" doesn't push its subtext too hard, even near the end, when it becomes clear that the men are out here to repair personal as well as geographical damage. \"Prince Avalanche\" represents a partial return to roots for its writer and director. Green's first three films\u2014\"George Washington,\" \"All the Real Girls\" and \"Undertow\"\u2014were models of American art-house ingenuity, drawing heavily the work of Terrence Malick, Werner Herzog and other filmmakers who like to explore natural beauty, human psychology, and the relationship between them. Then Green took a seemingly bizarre turn into goofball stoner-bro comedies: \"Pineapple Express\" and \"Your Highness.\"\u00a0But as Christy Lemire points out in her profile of Green, this wasn't a case of a filmmaker abandoning his gifts to make something commercial: the two modes represented different aspects of Green's interest. One of the many fascinating things about \"Prince Avalanche\" is how it merges those two types of films with understated grace.\u00a0 The bickering and manly preening and childish yet hurtful insults, the farting and scratching and other base gestures, and the expertly staged physical comedy (some of which seems to have been improvised) have that '80s comedy feel that Green loves. But the picture's vibe is pure arthouse visionary, channelling Herzog, Malick and the dramas that Gus van Sant made in the aughts (particularly \"Gerry\").\u00a0 Green displays a similarly adventurous yet kind spirit here. The most powerful scene is one of the subtlest: Alvin talking to a woman named Joyce Payne, whose home was destroyed by the blaze. Payne is a real-life fire survivor, and that was actually her house. Green and the crew met her during filmmaking and thought it would be nice to work her into the movie.\u00a0\"This is your house,\" Alvin says. \"Was,\" she corrects him. \"Everything's past tense now.\" \u00a0She tells him she used to be a pilot, and wonders how \"anybody's gonna prove that I had all these experiences, and flying.\" She tells him he's looking for her pilot's license. \"Do you think it burned up?\" Alvin says. \"I guess so,\" she replies.\u00a0 Alvin goes into an adjacent ruin and walks around. He pretends it's a functioning house with people in it, and that perhaps his wife is there and is glad to see him. It's an impressive bit of Chaplin-eseque pantomime by Rudd, who's a revelation in this film, but there's more going on here than a bravura display. Something deep is roiling within this man, something he can't let out. We live in our illusions. We don't want to leave them.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "24 Days", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Playing cat and mouse with kidnappers can be a grisly and\r\nawful business even if\u00ad\u2014or maybe the phrase should be \u201cparticularly if\u201d\u2014the\r\nkidnappers are dumb as dirt. That\u2019s one of the takeaways of \u201c24 Days,\u201d a\r\nwell-engineered suspense drama from France directed by Alexandre Arcady. The\r\nmovie, starring Zabou Breitman, Jacque Gamblin, Pascal Elb\u00e9, Sylvie Testud, and\r\nTony Harrisson, has a more upsetting dimension than most suspense dramas as\r\nit\u2019s based on a true story, a story that touches on issues still roiling France\r\ntoday.  Advertisement The movie begins with Breitman, in the role of Ruth Halimi,\r\ndirectly addressing the camera, and asking, \u201cHow could this happen in France in\r\n2006?\u201d The kidnapping of Halimi\u2019s son, Ilan, is what happened to begin with.\r\nArcady shows Ilan\u2019s family preparing for a group meal and going into loud shock\r\non learning of Ilan\u2019s abduction; particularly searing is the photo of Ilan with\r\nhis eyes and mouth duct-taped, with a gun to his head. Ruth and her ex-husband\r\nDidier (Elb\u00e9) go to the police. The head of the investigation, Delcour\r\n(Gamblin), is competent and highly invested, as is his crew, as is the\r\npsychologist/negotiation expert Brigitte Farrell (Testud) who works with Didier\r\non the phone calls from the ransom-demander whose name they don\u2019t know yet. His\r\nminions, underclass kids of all ethnicities, know him as \u201cDjango,\u201d and they\r\ndon\u2019t dare cross him.\u00a0 But Django, whose real name is Fofana, and who shuttles\r\nbetween Paris and his ancestral home of the Ivory Coast of Africa, isn\u2019t quite\r\nas much of a mastermind as he conceives himself. His original scheme was to\r\nkidnap a Jew, a strategy borne not so much out of race hate per se (although\r\nit\u2019s there) as a conviction that, good grief, \u201cJews have all the money.\u201d Not\r\nonly do they have all the money, but also they stick together and bail out\r\ntheir own. As it happens none of the Halimis are rich, or even particularly\r\naffluent. But Fofana\u2019s accomplices are pretty dim, and pretty sadistic. And as\r\nthe captivity drags on, Ruth is reminded of the case of Daniel Pearl. When\r\nFofana taunts the victim\u2019s parents with a reading from the Koran, it\u2019s a\r\nparticularly sick-making moment.  Arcady\u2019s direction is tight and efficient throughout (the\r\nsecond unit was handled by Alexandre Aja, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Arcady\u2014his son,\r\nto be precise\u2014who\u2019s made an, um, interesting career in American horror\r\npictures) and overstated at times, although by Hollywood standard his modes of\r\noverstatement (slow motion shots of characters turning around as they make\r\nsudden terrifying realizations, and so on) are almost subtle! But his handling\r\nof the story\u2019s very ugly twists and turns, particularly as the appalling Fofana\r\ngrows more truculent in his demands, is unimpeachable. As for its social\r\nanalysis, it\u2019s tough for non-residents of France to judge it. It\u2019s pretty clear\r\nthat the film falls squarely on the side of Ruth, who campaigned for the\r\nauthorities to acknowledge that anti-Semitism was at least an aggravating\r\nfactor in the case. And of course anti-Semitism is a French cultural issue\r\ngoing back to even before the Dreyfus case. These days the country has\r\nimmigration, so-called radical Islam, and other factors in this mix.\u00a0 Advertisement The finale\r\nof the movie could arguably be said to offload the anti-Semitism concern onto a\r\nnon-French-born person of color, which may strike some social-justice-sensitive\r\ntypes as\u2026what\u2019s the word?...\u201dproblematic.\u201d Sometimes the problem with finding\r\nthings \u201cproblematic\u201d is the fact staring you in the face: Fofana the individual\r\ndid, as it happened, do all the awful things of which he was accused. His last\r\nwords in the film are \u201cF**k France, bitches,\u201d which, yes, in the context of\r\nthis presentation are pretty \u201con the nose.\u201d On the other hand, it sounds like\r\nsomething the real-life Fofana would actually say.

{"Title": "After Earth", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"After Earth\" is a lovely surprise. This film from producer-costar Will Smith and director M. Night Shyamalan, about a father and son marooned on a hostile future earth, is a moral tale disguised as a sci-fi blockbuster. It's no classic, but it's a special movie: spectacular and wise. Smith plays a veteran space soldier with the metaphorically overripe name of Cypher Raige. The actor's real-life son Jaden (\"The Karate Kid,\" \"The Pursuit of Happyness\") plays Cypher's son Kitai, an aspiring warrior who just failed his cadet promotion test. The script, cowritten by Shyamalan and Gary Whitta, lays out a futureworld in brisk brushstrokes. Humans have fled a polluted Earth and built cities on the distant Nova Prime. Unfortunately, the planet was already claimed by another species that didn't take kindly to the colonists and created predators to kill them. The predators are called ursas. They look a like huge versions of Mike from \"Monsters, Inc.,\" only dipped in acid and slime and outfitted with razor fangs and pincers. They hunt by smelling fear. Advertisement The humans of Nova Prime fought the ursas to a draw, but one of them still killed Kitai's sister during a home invasion when the boy was younger. The kid has a survivor's guilt, and his dad feels horrible for being away on assignment when the nightmare happened. On top of all this, Cypher's a bit of a Cypher: a warrior known for his ability to \"ghost,\" slang for fighting without fear, but very much a ramrod-straight man-of-few-words type, so emotionally constipated that he seems to have to remind himself what laughter sounds like. Kitai is the eager young space cadet trying to embody and exceed his father's example, craving expressions of approval and love that his pop's not wired to provide. I realize I've described the main characters as if we spend the first hour eavesdropping on them in therapy. \"After Earth\" isn't like that. It's a stoic film about stoic characters fighting for their lives. The Raiges' ship is damaged in a freak asteroid storm, tossed out of hyperspace and into Earth's orbit, skims across the atmosphere like a pie plate, and is torn in two. Cypher and Kitai are the only survivors from the front half. Their distress beacon has been destroyed in the crash. The ship's back half, which might or might not contain a working distress beacon, is 100 kilometers away. If the castaways don't call for help soon, they'll asphyxiate or get eaten by predators, one of which is an ursa that was cargo on their ship, set free by the crash. Cypher's legs are broken. Kitai has to make the journey for him. He only has his trusty \"cutlass\" (a retractable double-bladed weapon), and an environmental suit containing basic supplies and a video-audio system that can let his father guide him from afar. Most of the film's dialogue is goal-related:\u00a0Go here. Try this. No dad, that won't work, I should try something else.\u00a0The film tells its story as Cypher or Kitai might. Each scene lasts as long as it should, and no longer. The camera moves with a purpose: to follow and frame and explain action, conceal or reveal surprises, and deepen the relationship between the characters and their world. Advertisement This is the right movie at the right time for Shyamalan. He usually writes, directs and acts in his own features. His control-freak tendencies magnify both his merits (spooky atmosphere, cunningly staged shocks, virtuoso camerawork) and his flaws (contrived \"twist\" endings, sub-Spielberg sentimentality, geeky fake-profundity). After the critical and box office misfires of \"The Village,\" \"Lady in the Water,\" \"The Happening\" and \"The Last Airbender,\" some thought he was finished as an A-list filmmaker. His talent was still there, but it was hard to see it behind all that ego. His pop mojo was as wrecked as Cypher's starship. Shyamalan didn't originate this project. He rewrote a script based on a story by Smith, who read a magazine piece about a father and son surviving after a plane crash, re-imagined it as a space fantasy, and hired Shyamalan to direct. So he's a gun-for-hire on \"After Earth\" \u2014 but clearly not a disinterested one. The M. Night vibe is subdued here, but you can still feel it \u2014 particularly in the wide shots of Kitai scrambling along forest floors and up mountain peaks, and in the scenes of Cypher talking his son across treacherous land, their tightly-framed faces answering each other through editing, and sometimes seeming to meld into one organism with shared consciousness. In the film's lyrical final act, the two seem as spiritually attuned as E.T. and Elliott. The movie's world is nearly as CGI-enhanced as the title world of \"Avatar,\" but it feels more real. It's not a special effects theme park with a new slobbering space beast behind every tree trunk, but a fully imagined ecosystem, a tapestry of flora and fauna. Fern fronds curl in icy night air. Flocks of birds form patterns in the sky. Carnivorous baboons, great cats, wild pigs, snakes and condors move like real animals, and react to threats with intelligence as well as force. Some of Shyamalan's images echo classic movie tales of survival and madness in nature: \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Searchers,\" \"The Naked Prey,\" \"The Edge.\" Advertisement \"After Earth\" is ultimately too thin of a story to support all of its grandiose embellishments, but so what? It's better to try to pack every moment with beauty and feeling than to shrug and smirk. The film takes the characters and their feelings seriously, and lets its actors give strong, simple performances. The younger Smith is a great male ingenue character, unaffected and kindhearted and free of vanity. The elder Smith stows the Bel Air badass shtick that makes many of his star performances tedious and gives a restrained, very physical performance, letting subtle vocal tremors and shifts in body language hint at the worries that the father hides from his son. In scenes that frame Will Smith's watery eyes and battered, crewcut head in close-up, the star evokes the middle-aged Burt Lancaster: a monument to machismo, worn down by pain and time. The father teaches lessons to the son, and the son to the father. As the poster says, danger is real, but fear is a choice. You can become the master of an event, the creator of a moment, even if it seems overwhelming, if you've absorbed the wisdom of people who lived through similar tests and told you how they survived them. And yet no lessons are universally helpful, no rules ironclad. Sometimes you have to disobey orders, even if they come from a commanding officer who gave you half of your DNA. Parent and child must ultimately separate because it's the only way to re-create themselves as equals. On some level both characters know this, even though it makes them sad. All this sounds corny by current standards. But by current standards, Aesop's fables and Bible stories are corny, too. \"After Earth\" carries itself with confidence because it knows what it wants to say, and how to say it. The asteroid storm appears suddenly, as if willed into being by Poseidon stirring a cauldron with his trident. The design of the spaceship would make Odysseus feel at home: the ribs of its hull seem to be made of wood and bone. The skyscrapers on Nova Prime are built from triangular wedges that suggest a schooner's sails. The warriors fight with blades. Ursa is Latin for bear. Kitai's leap from a high cliff is a leap of faith. His name is Japanese for \"hope.\" This movie is a fable. Fables teach. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Southwest of Salem: The Story of the San Antonio Four", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"[The San Antonio Four] case represents the last gasp of the Satanic Ritual Abuse panic.\" The quote comes from Debbie Nathan, an interview subject in Deborah S. Esquenazi's documentary \"Southwest of Salem.\" The documentary details the case of the \"San Antonio Four,\" where four Latina lesbians were accused in 1994 of gang-raping two little girls. The trials followed a couple of years later, and none of the women took plea bargains; all maintained their innocence and all were given lengthy prison sentences. Debbie Nathan co-wrote a book in 1995 debunking SRA (\"Satanic ritual abuse\"), that bizarre hysteria that swept the nation in the 1980s, a hysteria which got serious coverage in the news at the time (as though it was a real thing), and impacted law enforcement procedures, childcare and pediatric institutions, as well as therapeutic practices like \"recovered memories,\" designed to help children \"recover\" memories of their abuse. The \"San Antonio Four\" did not receive much (if any) national media coverage. Esquenazi became interested in the case years ago, and reached out to Debbie Nathan, who had also been a researcher and interview subject in Andrew Jarecki's 2003 documentary \"Capturing the Friedmans,\" another case that erupted out of the SRA panic. \"Southwest of Salem,\" featuring prison interviews with all four women, is an urgent and often infuriating documentary about the San Antonio Four's quest for justice and exoneration, a quest that remains ongoing. Advertisement Anna Vasquez, Cassandra Rivera, Kristie Mayhugh and Elizabeth Ramirez all came from strict Catholic homes, and grew up in a conservative Texas environment. \"Coming out\" was stepping into an unknown world, with perhaps terrifying consequences. Anna Vasquez came out to her mother when she was still in high school. Her mother went to talk to her priest about it and asked him what she should do about her daughter. He said, essentially, \"Love her.\" And so she did. Some of the other girls didn't have it so lucky. They were thrown out of their homes, disowned. Anna and Cassie, a young woman with two children, fell in love. Kristie and Elizabeth made up the larger posse, and the women were friends, helping one another, being there for one another. For years all was well, until one day, after taking care of two of Elizabeth's young nieces, the four women were accused of sexual assault. There was no physical evidence that a crime had taken place. Although the four women insisted that nothing had happened, in an environment of hysteria, homophobia and credulity, they didn't stand a chance. There was sketchy evidence from a pediatrician (debunked later), as well as the testimony of the two little girls, testimony that sounded fantastical, beggaring belief. Elizabeth's brother-in-law, Javier Limon, father to the two accusers, had been pursuing Elizabeth romantically, and was angry that she rejected his advances. Couldn't it be possible that he had coerced his children to make up a story so he could \"get even\" with the woman who dared to prefer women over him? But there wasn't a lot of critical thinking going on, and\u2014understandably\u2014nobody wants to disbelieve children when they make an accusation like that. The womens' homosexuality was used against them in their trials, and the news coverage was quite literally hysterical: the women were clearly witches, the children were \u201csacrificed on the altar of lust\u201d (an actual headline). Esquenazi presents all of this complicated information in a straightforward and compelling way, using local news footage, home movie footage, and prison interviews with the four co-defendants. Anna is the main interview subject, and she can still barely speak of what happened without weeping. Elizabeth is devastated that her nieces, whom she took care of all the time, would betray her, but she knew they had been coached by her vindictive brother-in-law. Anna refused to go into the Sex Offender program in prison, jeopardizing her possibility of parole, and causing her to lose any prison privileges she might have gained. Esquenazi also interviews the sheriff, the Mayor, the lawyers, many of whom betray their prejudices right to the camera, seemingly not realizing that they are doing so. The one unsatisfying interview is with Javier, who claims that nothing Elizabeth says is true. As more and more information comes out, one wishes that Esquenazi would return to that interview, ask some tougher questions, push him to go deeper, explain himself. What is his relationship like with his daughters, the original accusers, now? There are many unanswered questions. Advertisement The \"San Antonio Four\" do not have the brand-name recognition of the West Memphis Three although the cases share a lot of similarities. Viewers may get flashbacks to Joe Berlinger's \"Paradise Lost\" documentary series, another case\u2014occurring at the same moment in time\u2014borne out of the Satanic Ritual Abuse panic where innocent people, perceived as \"different\" by the communities in which they lived, were accused and convicted of horrible crimes. Despite the lack of media attention, the San Antonio Four caught the eye of a researcher who lives in the Yukon Territory, of all places. He was outraged by what he saw and began a campaign to get their cases re-opened. This was how Debbie Nathan got involved, and that eventually led to the famed Innocence Project (the Lubbock chapter) becoming interested in a re-investigation of the evidence. One of the accusers, now in her 20s, re-canted her original story, saying she and her sister had been coached by their father and their grandmother on what to say. The four women want complete exoneration. They do not want to have to register as sex offenders when they are released. They want the record wiped clean. Similar to the first and second installments of \"Paradise Lost,\" \"Southwest of Salem\" is a story that has not found its ending yet. Like Truman Capote, waiting to see what would happen to murderers Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, for months, years, knowing he needed some definitive outcome in order to finish his book \"In Cold Blood,\" Esquenazi has watched and waited and filmed, following the course of the case. Her documentary footage represents years of work, and it's an extremely impressive archive (a shoutout must be given to the talented editors, Leah Marino and Liz Perlman). \"Southwest of Salem\" has an investigative questioning bent, but it is always clear in its attitudes about the four co-defendants. It is a powerful act of advocacy. It's hard to look at these events in any light other than that a terrible miscarriage of justice has taken place.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Burnt", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Food porn, no matter how expertly and attractively presented, is no substitute for actual food. But if you are susceptible to the blandishments of food porn, \u201cBurnt,\u201d a new Bradley-Cooper-starring drama about a brilliant-but-troubled chef looking for a shot at redemption, might leave you hungry for a meal you\u2019ll possibly be hard-pressed to afford.\u00a0Money-wise, and maybe existentially.\u00a0 \n Heavy on beautifully-lit tight shots of blue burner flames, immaculate china plates, various foams, glazes, char marks, roots, zests, and all other manner of mouth-watering visuals for discriminating gourmands (the consultant on kitchen matters was pioneering chef Mario Batali, a bonafide kitchen genius), \u201cBurnt\u201d concentrates on the fashionable high-end of gastronomy. Cooper\u2019s character, Adam Jones recounts in voice-over that he\u2019s been doing penance for unspecified sins by shucking oysters in New Orleans \u2026 and, once he\u2019s gotten to one million, boom, suddenly he\u2019s in London, making snide comments to hotel restaurant ma\u00eetre d' Daniel Br\u00fchl about the mediocre quality of his fare. Adam isn\u2019t just in-person trolling fancy joints in this big, you\u2019ll excuse the word, foodie town. No, Br\u00fchl\u2019s Tony shares a past with Adam. Although London\u2019s a big town, the fact that Adam can\u2019t turn a corner without running into someone from his past makes the place seem like one of the backstage areas depicted in the recent Steve Jobs movie. Why, here\u2019s Omar Sy\u2019s Michel, who Adam pranked most heinously in Paris back in the day. And here\u2019s Uma Thurman\u2019s Simone, a restaurant critic Adam once dallied with against her better judgment, not just because Adam\u2019s a bad egg, but because Simone herself is a lesbian (that\u2019s JUST how much of a bad egg Adam really is). Adam also meets, and alienates, a few newbies: Sam Keeley\u2019s eager young chef cadet David, upon whose couch Adam imposes, and single-mom sous-chef Helene, who is a single-mom sous-chef played by Sienna Miller, so take a wild guess.\u00a0 Advertisement \n \u201cBurnt\u201d is yet another redemption story of the Destructive Genius, whom the audience is supposed to be compelled to like in spite of himself, and who begins his journey with a list of things he\u2019s not supposed to indulge in (in this case\u2014surprise\u2014it\u2019s booze, drugs, and women). Then, the narrative bends circumstances to allow the Destructive Genius to get at least one of those things (take a guess\u2026could it be a\u2026single mom sous-chef?) and pull off a triumph, also in spite of himself, but with the assistance of a Crucial Teachable Moment.\u00a0 \n \"Ugh,\" one might say, and one might have a point. One doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s better or worse that the whole scenario is polished with the sheen that I once called the Weinstein Tradition of Quality, back around the time of \u201cThe Cider House Rules,\u201d I think. Miramax Films may no longer exist, but under their Weinstein Company rubric, Harvey and Bob Weinstein continue to make, albeit with somewhat less frequency than they used to, Miramax-y product. Miramax-y product did/does have its virtues, however, and since John Wells is a director of some conscience and screenwriter Steven Knight is in fact capable of first-rate work, \u201cBurnt\u201d packs some minor surprises and attractive details along its way\u2014one sequence in which David draws an analogy between Michelin book stars and \u201cStar Wars\u201d heroes is funny and apt\u2014and shows a certain amount of restraint when the inevitable triumphant note is struck.\u00a0There\u2019s also the cast. If you\u2019ve got any use for Cooper at all you\u2019ll be rather taken with him here. He gets to speak French, throw his own version of a Gordon Ramsey-style fit (many times, even), and does some serious twinkling when it\u2019s time to exercise the charm. The movie goes up several notches in quality every time Emma Thompson, as a sagacious therapist, turns up. Miller is tops, Sy is terrific, Br\u00fchl does quite well, particularly after his character is given a little revelation of his own, and Alicia Vikander makes a strong impression, as she does, in a very brief appearance. I have made a sacred vow to myself not to use the phrases \u201chungry for more\u201d or \u201cempty calories\u201d in what they call the \u201ckicker\u201d of my review, so forgive me if I end it on the abrupt side.

{"Title": "Una noche", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Lila, the Cuban teenager who is one of the lead characters in Lucy Mulloy's first feature, \"Una Noche,\" says in voiceover that she watches the people return to Havana from Miami, tourists now, and they seem changed: \"They lose that nervous desperation.\" Nervous desperation is the energy of \"Una Noche,\" a sexually charged and tense film that takes place over the course of one very long day in Havana, as three teenagers scheme to put together a raft that will transport them the 90 dangerous miles across the ocean to Miami.  Advertisement After that, their plan gets a little dim. One of the teens has a long-lost father who is in Miami, supposedly, so maybe they'll look him up. None of them speak English. Mulloy also wrote the screenplay, and spent years in Havana researching and finding the perfect non-professional actors who could handle this material. It is a confident and striking debut, with gorgeous and somewhat tragic footage of current-day Havana, in all its dilapidated splendor. The plot hurtles along on its rickety rails, plunging towards that expanse of crashing ocean that represents freedom and escape. Despite the bleak-ness of the situation, the film vibrates with color, noise, music, ferocious arguments (both serious and teasing), and eye-catching snapshots of everyday life in Havana. Lila (Anail\u00edn de la R\u00faa de la Torre) and Elio (Javier N\u00fa\u00f1ez Flori\u00e1n) are twins. Their parents are not so much neglectful as totally preoccupied with their own marital drama. Father is cheating on mother, father comes home and berates mother for the messy house, and so life at home is a big drag. Lila spends her time at the gym taking Taekwondo classes, and being made fun of by the more glamorous girls for her unshaved eyebrows and hairy arms. But her primary relationship is with her brother. Elio works as a cook in a hotel restaurant. He rides his bike along the cracked streets overgrown with weeds, with Lila sitting behind him. He looks out for her, she looks out for him.  But Elio has a secret. Well, a couple of secrets. One is that he is helping his friend Raul (Dariel Arrechaga) put together a plan to get Raul to Miami to find his father. The other secret is deeper and can certainly be guessed at through behavior through the film, although the \"reveal\" doesn't come until late.\u00a0 Elio is resourceful. He knows he needs to procure inner tubes, lumber, a compass, and maybe even a GPS, for the journey. All of this can be found on the flourishing black market. There is one fascinating scene where Elio trades in his bike for an outboard motor (no gasoline included) from a guy who buys and sells things, anything you want, as long as you have something to trade.  Advertisement It all feels quite precarious, and it is. How does one plan for a getaway and yet also maintain the facade that you are not going anywhere? Elio doesn't want to tip anyone off, least of all his sister. But Lila is a sneak and a spy, following her father around, spying on Elio from around corners and palm trees. She can tell that something is up. And she does not like Raul.  Daniel Arrechaga is fantastic as the hot-headed and tormented Raul. He dresses flashily, and dreams of all of the gold chains he will get when he is in America. But the bravado hides a hurt child, abandoned by his father, and now the sole caretaker of his prostitute mother (Maria Adelaida Mendez Bonet) who is also ravaged by AIDS. When we first see his mother, she sits in a dark room, her face drawn and haggard, with a full-body cough. She tries to make her son drink warm milk, and he makes her drink it instead. Later, we see her under a highway overpass, standing with all of the other hookers, going off with a tourist who makes her an offer. It's harrowing. Later, Raul comes across his mother servicing a Western tourist, and accidentally injures the man. The cops are put on Raul's trail. Any sense of delaying his escape is lost. He must leave now, before the cops find him.  The three kids who play the three leads are wonderful in their roles, with that superb naturalism and intuitive power that can come in non-professionals. They know who they are, they know their relationships, they know the stakes. Raul starts drinking halfway through the day, and finds himself in scrape after scrape, and there's a feeling of danger and unpredictability surrounding the guy. But you love him. You love him so much.  Lila and Elio are completely believable as siblings and twins. They are in tune with one another's emotions, they speak in short-hand, and there is an ease and freedom in their body language together. The film ends with a frozen shot of the two of them on the bike which sums up all we have learned about them. (A side note: two of the leads, de la Rua and Florian, disappeared during their trip to the United States for the film's U.S. premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2012. They were supposed to come to New York from Miami, but instead they stayed in Miami, stating that they were seeking political asylum in the United States.)  Havana jumps off the screen in a visceral way. You can smell it, feel it, like a living presence. Raul complains at one point, \"The only things to do here are sweat and fuck.\" The entire atmosphere is jagged with rampant sexuality, street harassment, open prostitution, and cruel jokes. Every interaction takes on a sexualized tone, bordering on violence, which Lila finds tiresome. It takes a lot of energy to bat that nastiness away. You can sense the exhaustion.  Mulloy has a great eye for the unique, the special, in this landscape. There's a lonely shot of Elio riding his bike along the deserted waterfront on a grey day, with the tropic-green waves crashing over the sea wall in towers of foam. \u00a0Havana is a rich cultural landscape, but Mulloy and her cinematographers (Trevor Forrest and Shlomo Godder) zoom in on the particulars. A yellow canary sits in a cage hanging on a hook outside a building. Windchimes of colored glass sway against the white stone background. A hooker's black shoes lie on grimy tile with a wire of Christmas tree lights snaking up the wall, lending garish romantic atmosphere to a transaction devoid of romance. Old withered guys clack dominoes at a table on a sidewalk. Kids run wild in the parks, leaping from the sea wall into the ocean. The cars that glide through the streets are all brightly colored gigantic gas-guzzlers, with gleaming fins from the 1950s, but a closer look shows the decay, the deteriorating steering wheels. These are details, snapshots, fragments, but put together they create a fully-inhabited, three-dimensional reality.  The use of voiceover is problematic, especially when it describes what is already evident in the behavior; Lila tells us \"I didn't know why Elio was being so secretive\" after we've already felt the distance opening up between the siblings, and sensed Lila's anxiety at what will happen if Elio abandons her in Havana.\u00a0But that would count as a nitpick, especially with a film as strong, as sure, as this one.

{"Title": "How to Dance in Ohio", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Alexandra Shiva\u2019s \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio,\u201d premiering Monday\r\nnight on HBO after a successful festival run, is a tender, compassionate look at\r\nthree young women living life on the autism spectrum. In many ways, it\u2019s a\r\nstellar example of what Roger spoke about when he discussed film as an empathy\r\nmachine, offering insight into lives we may not fully understand. It\u2019s a bit shapeless in terms of filmmaking, but this is a \u201ccharacter\r\ndocumentary,\u201d a study of people that you won\u2019t soon forget, and it works on that level. Advertisement \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio\u201d observes different sessions at Amigo Family Counseling, a center for children, teens\r\nand adults with autism. Dr. Emilio Amigo gently motivates his patients with\r\nchallenges designed to show them that their limitations are not as defined as\r\nthey may think they are. Amigo\u2019s approach can be inspirational far beyond that\r\nof his patients, adopting a style that could be best summed up when he says, \u201cThey will believe they can succeed when they\r\nsucceed.\u201d He doesn\u2019t coddle his patients, but instead sets up challenges\r\nthat he knows they can surpass. Shiva\u2019s whole film works off Amigo\u2019s balance of\r\nempowerment and safety. People with autism often fear for their own security, and\r\nAmigo teaches them that they can be happy, highly functioning and not be\r\nafraid. We can all take something away from when he says, \u201cLet\u2019s give it up for butterflies! That means you\u2019re alive!\u201d Shiva's film chronicles\r\nthe three months leading up to an Amigo Family Counseling Formal Dance. Yes,\r\nhis patients will have to get dressed up, interact, slow dance and even line\r\ndance. If you think about it, a formal dance is a series of social\r\ninteractions, whether they\u2019re dancing in a group with others, asking someone\r\nyou like to cut a rug, or even just socializing around the punch bowl. As\r\nexpected, most of Amigo\u2019s patients are fearful, but they work towards the big\r\nday, wondering who to ask as their date and even going dress-shopping. In particular, Shiva focuses on three women\u2014a 16-year-old named Marideth, a\r\n19-year-old named Caroline and a 22-year-old named Jessica. Labels like\r\nautistic often paint with a broad brush for people who hear them; one\r\nlesson to be learned by \u201cOhio\u201d is the notable differences between these three\r\nyoung ladies. Marideth seems to just be coming out of her shell. Her parents\r\nnote that they only get two minutes of conversation, but that\u2019s two minutes\r\nmore than they used to get. She\u2019s unpredictable in her degree of confidence,\r\ntelling Shiva that she likes to research and then shutting down when asked what she likes to research. Caroline has a boyfriend she met in Amigo\u2019s class, and\r\nshe\u2019s going to other classes, but is nervous about taking the bus to get there.\r\nJessica gets the most screen time, and she\u2019s close to being completely\r\nindependent, even working a bakery, although she sometimes struggles with\r\nco-workers.  Advertisement How will I know what to say to someone when they talk to me?\r\nHow will I know if someone is joking? What do I say when I\u2019m nervous? Most people\r\nwith autism can\u2019t inherently and instinctually respond to social cues like you\r\nor me. And \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio\u201d deftly captures that aspect of the condition.\r\nWe see Marideth, Caroline and Jessica taking small steps forward, although the\r\nfilm is careful not to present their condition as something that needs a cure.\r\nIt\u2019s just a fact of their lives, something they use Dr. Amigo\u2019s class to\r\nmanage. The best elements of \u201cHow to Dance in Ohio\u201d don\u2019t feel like a\r\ndisease-of-the-week documentary\u2014on the contrary, they illuminate the\r\ncommonality we\u2019ve all faced at a difficult job or nerve-inducing formal dance.\r\nWe\u2019ve all felt those butterflies.

That\u2019s\r\nhow conscientiously structured it is.

She tells him he\r\nreally ought to settle down, family is everything, etc. Whereupon Garza takes\r\nsaid partner out on a drug bust and, well take a wild guess.

The barmaid and Garza end up together, in a family way,\r\nand then she\u2019s kidnapped by the same drug dealers who got his partner, and the\r\nU.S. feds get involved (Eric Roberts plays the head honcho). It's a big mess. It\u2019s an even bigger mess because the movie is so haphazardly edited. One\r\nunderstands the effect that Begne\u2019s aiming for\u2014flashing forward and backward in\r\nshort order during certain scenes to highlight bits of information that are\r\nmeant to pay off in \u201caha!\u201ds for the\r\nviewer\u2014but the execution is staggeringly shoddy and stumbling. The ostensible\r\nhumor\u2014diarrhea jokes, amputated-finger-of-a-corpse jokes, burning-people-alive\r\njokes\u2014competes with plot complications thrown about willy-nilly.

There isn\u2019t really\r\na \u201cHot Pink\u201d dial on a color-correcting console. But you know what I\u2019m saying.  Eventually, the movie works up a weird fascination.

{"Title": "The Hunting Ground", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Director Kirby Dick & Producer Amy Ziering follow up their award-winning \u201cThe\r\nInvisible War\u201d with another incendiary, shocking, infuriating masterpiece, \u201cThe\r\nHunting Ground.\u201d Again, they tackle an institution that has engendered a\r\nclimate in which sexual assault has nearly become normalized, an expectation on\r\ncertain college campuses. Over the next year, over 100,000 women will be\r\nsexually assaulted on college campuses. As disturbing as the actual crimes are,\r\nDick & Ziering point a righteous finger at the administrations that know\r\ntheir campuses live up to the title of this film for young women and yet they\r\ndo nothing in the pursuit of the almighty dollar. Our institutions of higher\r\nlearning are often sacrificing the safety of the children who go there in order\r\nto quash statistics that might hurt enrollment. It is an infuriating reality\r\nthat \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d exposes. I was rattled watching it, finding it hard\r\nto catch my breath and harder still to imagine how many people are in positions\r\nof power who have heard these stories so many times and turned their backs on\r\nvictims.  Advertisement It is a bit of a cruel joke that Dick & Ziering open\r\ntheir film with home videos of high school students reading their acceptance\r\nletters to the tune of \u201cPomp & Circumstance.\u201d And yet it\u2019s appropriate\r\nbecause it sets up a very vital theme in \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d\u2014that of the\r\nwide-eyed, optimistic teenager who really just wants to get an education but\r\nhas been sold a false bill of goods about their own safety. Lest you think any\r\nof this might be exaggerated for cinematic impact, the filmmakers pepper their\r\nentire film with jaw-dropping facts. 16-20% of undergraduates will be sexually\r\nassaulted. Even more won\u2019t report it for fear of falling into the category of a\r\nvictim or having to deal with an administration and society quick to blame the\r\nvictim. When one rape victim reports that the administrator to whom she\r\nreported the crime compared rape to a football game\u2014\u201cwhat would have done\r\ndifferently in the game?\u201d\u2014I literally wanted to start screaming. And that\u2019s\r\nwhat Dick & Ziering want. We should be screaming. The stats continue. In 2012, 40% of all colleges reported no\r\nsexual assaults. If there\u2019s anyone out there who actually believes that 2 out\r\nof 5 college campuses in this country actually had no sexual assaults that year, I\u2019m impressed you know how to use\r\nthe internet. What is actually happening is a very careful protection of the\r\nbrand name that is a college reputation. And it\u2019s happening everywhere. Even at\r\na place like Harvard, people are asking questions like \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you fight\r\nhim?\u201d At the University of Virginia, they had ZERO expulsions for sexual\r\nassault in the same time period that they had 183 for cheating and other\r\nacademic violations. Expelling cheaters looks better to check-cutting parents\r\nthan telling them that their child may not be safe. And this environment of denial\r\nallows for repeat offenders, who commit an average of SIX assaults. In some\r\ncases, they are literally given sanctuary in athletic facilities. Campus security\r\nat Notre Dame cannot contact athletes for any reason, even if a rape has been\r\nreported.  As a director, Dick knows how to build a case, intercutting\r\ninterviews with statistics that portray an epidemic, a crisis, a serious\r\nproblem for all Americans of all ages. Most importantly, they empower the\r\nvictims, giving them a platform from which to speak that the institutions that\r\nthey supported through attendance and tuition did not. And they focus most of\r\ntheir energy on two young women from North Carolina\u2014Andrea Pino and Annie E.\r\nClark\u2014who were raped on their campus and turned their stories into rallying\r\ncries for change across the country. Just as they did with Kori Cioca in \u201cThe\r\nInvisible War,\u201d the directors present true heroism in Pino and Clark, two\r\npeople who stood up for victim\u2019s rights and ended up revealing the depth of a problem\r\nthat I don\u2019t think even they knew was so widespread. \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d could\r\nhave been a series of disturbing statistics and personal stories, but the\r\ndirectors know that it is the survivors who are trying to enact change who will\r\ninspire viewers to support the action needed to make it so.  Advertisement The structure of \u201cThe Hunting Ground\u201d gets repetitive but\r\nthat\u2019s by design and Dick does an admirable job of subtly moving\r\nthrough different aspects of the issue from the lack of institutional response\r\nto the frat system to the athletic program, even spending a notable amount of\r\ntime on the Jameis Winston story and Florida State\u2019s disturbing response or\r\nlack thereof to the accusations against the soon-to-be NFL player. Whether or\r\nnot you believe Winston\u2019s accuser is not the issue\u2014although his fans and those\r\nof the program he led to glory will see it that way. No, the issue is that\r\nvictims are presumed to either be a contributing factor in the crime or\r\ndismissed altogether, especially when the accused is a superstar athlete.

{"Title": "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Fantasy (in this sense) is, I think, not a lower but a higher form of Art, indeed the most nearly pure form, and so (when achieved) the most potent.\" -J.R.R. Tolkien, March 8, 1939 lecture \"Fairy Stories\" Tolkien's parenthetical \"when achieved\" is the kicker of that statement, the acknowledgement of how difficult and rare successful fantasy really is. You know it when you see it. This reviewer did not find that quality in \"An Unexpected Journey\", the first installment of Peter Jackson's gigantic trilogy based on Tolkien's slim one-volume classic \"The Hobbit,\" but it is there in spades in part two, \"The Desolation of Smaug.\" This middle chapter is about a half-hour too long, and the final third splits the story up into three pieces, weakening the narrative thrust that had been building, but no matter: By the time we get to Bilbo Baggins' confrontation with the dragon Smaug (voiced with delicious sneering evil by Benedict Cumberbatch), the real work has been done. The thematic elements are in place, the emotional tension is highly strung, and the action unfolds in a wave like the fire erupting from the dragon's mouth, overtaking all in its path.\u00a0 Advertisement Except for a flashback which shows Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the exiled dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) joining forces in a dark and beer-soaked pub straight out of Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", \"The Desolation of Smaug\" picks up where the last one left off, with Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the posse of rowdy dwarves deep into their journey to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and the dwarves' lost kingdom.\u00a0 Bilbo, dragged reluctantly from his comfy hole-in-the-ground in the Shire in the first film, is now resigned to his fate, and shows resourcefulness and pluck in one harrowing situation after another. He's also got that mysterious golden ring he found in the goblin tunnel\u2014the one that seems to make him invisible, the one that nobody else knows about, not yet. It will come in handy. Gandalf tries to keep the team together, but forges off on his own solitary spell-breaking mission (which Tolkien's book suggests is undertaken by Gandalf to force Bilbo to gain the trust of the dwarves on his own). Along the way, the heroes find shelter in the home of a shape-shifting Giant-slash-Bear, and are pursued by a galloping army of Orcs. To save time, they cut through the Mirkwood Forest and run into a terrifying herd of gigantic attacking spiders, in a scene doomed to give me nightmares for months. (I have barely recovered from reading that scene in the book when I was 10 years old.) Saved and then imprisoned by the isolationist-minded elves, the dwarves and Bilbo find a way to escape in a bunch of barrels down a river, being attacked from the banks by orcs and elves alike.\u00a0 Some old friends show up: cool-eyed Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). There's a new elf in town, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), who is drawn to one of the dwarves; the romantic triangle she sparks has nothing to do with anything, but it is still nice to see Tauriel act as a deus ex machina on a couple of occasions. Stephen Fry has a great cameo as the Master of Lake-Town, a despicable and gout-ridden person lording it over his fearful constituents from on high; it's a Dickensian piece of scene-chewing.\u00a0 Advertisement Jackson and his team have a lot of fun creating these three-dimensional worlds, overwhelming us with different moods, energies, and personalities. Some of the images are breathtaking: the Long Lake swathed in mist with mysterious structures rising out of it; the misty dark wood filled with shadowy waiting creatures; the elegant vertical fortress of the elves, soothing and yet rigid, too, indicating the elves' unwillingness to get involved in the larger dark forces overtaking the outside world. \u00a0The final confrontation with the dragon, when it comes, is worth the wait (although it would have been nice if the wait hadn't been quite so long).\u00a0The dragon's lair is gorgeously imagined, an undulating and ever-changing landscape of coins and gold. There are lots of great moments: a gigantic tapestry falling from the wall in a rippling wave; huge collapsing columns; tiny walkways over the abyss; the dwarves' visible awe at their ancestors' ingenuity and power. Throughout, you get the sense that you really are in a lost and glorious world. \u00a0 And yet for all its scope, there's also a kind of homespun silliness in Tolkien's book\u2014a \"Tut tut, isn't everything just a bit\u00a0much?\" energy, stereotypically British, which has sometimes been lost in the other films, overwhelmed as they are by portent and meaning. \u00a0It's not lost this time. That barrel scene, for example, goes on for what feels like forever, and every second is justified. It has its own momentum, chaotic and jubilant, reaching an almost screwball climax, as events catapult out of control and nobody is sure which end is up, least of all the dwarves.\u00a0Smaug is a fearsome beast, but you still laugh at the detail of Bilbo wincing at the breath emerging from the dragon's mouth. (Now\u00a0that's\u00a0the Bilbo I recognize from the book.)\u00a0 There's a moment before the spider attack that perfectly\u00a0aligns us with the overall intent of Tolkien's fiction. Bilbo is told to climb one of the trees to peek out of the top of the forest and see how much further they have to go. When he pushes his head through the top, all he can see is a carpet of autumn leaves spreading almost as far as the eye can see, with blue butterflies flitting about along the leaf-tips. The sun shines brightly, and for a moment Bilbo is awestruck. We know that what happens next is bound to be grisly and terrible. But beauty is there to be appreciated, and the hobbits, with their love of homey nature, pretty colors, and comfort, know this as well as we do.\u00a0It was the love of home that kept people going in the dark years during which Tolkien wrote these volumes, when the shadow of war overhung Europe.\u00a0The sunlight-drenched green fields of the Shire are long gone by that point in Bilbo's story, a distant memory, but the memory gives Bilbo his power. It is worth fighting for.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Past Life", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Hollywood lost the knack of creating multi-leveled character dramas quite some time ago. For these, movie lovers now have to look to Europe, Asia\u2014and to the Middle East. The work of Asghar Farhadi, the Iranian writer/director, is knotty and ever engrossing, illuminating moral and ethical concerns in the contexts of domestic stories always rooted in immediate social reality. The recent films of the Israeli director Avi Nesher (who worked in Hollywood in the 1990s, largely on genre pictures) are not dissimilar\u2014full-bodied, complex, densely written. His latest, \u201cPast Life,\u201d is a story about reckoning with the past that begins with a bang. Advertisement The year is 1977. An Israeli choir is performing a concert in Berlin. In the audience an older woman peruses the concert program. She looks up the name of the lovely young woman giving a soprano solo during one piece. She recognizes that name. At a reception afterwards, the older woman, Agnieszka (Katarzyna Gniewkowska), approaches the young singer, Sephi Milch (Joy Rieger). Sephi speaks no German or Polish, and Agnieszka speaks no Hebrew. And yet, in the course of a fraught exchange during which Agnieszka grasps Sephi\u2019s wrist most aggressively, the point is made: Agnieszka knew Sephi\u2019s father, and Sephi\u2019s father was a murderer. Back home in Israel, the father we meet does not square with that description. Baruch Milch (Doron Tavory) is stiff and strict with his family but in his practice as a physician he\u2019s both no-nonsense and honestly compassionate. Sephi tells her older sister, Nana (Nelly Tagar) about her odd Berlin encounter and Nana, a journalist, takes up the story. Together they make some discoveries that disturb the hell out of them, and they confront their father. Baruch does not flinch. Rather, he welcomes the opportunity to unburden himself of the past and set the record straight. As a persecuted Jew during the Holocaust, he was protected by a Polish family. But he did not get out entirely \u201cclean\u201d so to speak.  The thread of discovery in this film\u2019s storyline is accompanied by others. There\u2019s Sephi\u2019s musical work. She\u2019s a singer, but also a composer, and her academy instructor is extremely discouraging. \u201cFocus on your singing, not your dreams.\u201d Her deliverance of sorts comes in the form of a visiting composer from Germany. Who happens to be a relative of the woman who accosted her at the concert in Berlin. In the meantime, Nana remains suspicious of her father, and her lack of faith in him turns into a disillusionment with life itself\u2014which is of little help to her spirits once she learns she has cancer.  Advertisement If \u201cPast Life\u201d stumbles at all, it\u2019s in the scenes in which it intercuts between Nana\u2019s medical traumas and Sephi\u2019s continued detective work on a trip to Warsaw\u2014the idea of a certain kind of faith constituting a sort of lifeline is made too literal for my tastes here. But the movie shines in all other respects. The characterizations are spectacularly convincing across the board, the acting honors those characterizations fully. The period detail is present but not ostentatious. And the movie\u2019s climax, in which all the threads are not-quite pulled together, is a very moving one, one in which forgiveness is sought, and the difficulty of bestowing forgiveness is acknowledged. This is a striking and thought-provoking picture.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Bleed for This", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Bleed for This\" starts out like a traditional underdog-fighter-makes-good flick, based on a true story, pivots and becomes something else, then goes back to being traditional.  Miles Teller plays Vinny Paz, aka Pazienza, aka The Pazmanian  Devil, an Italian-American junior welterweight fighter from Rhode Island. He's a likable, young, working class guy who doesn't take the sport as seriously as he should. He barely makes weight and stays out all night before fights blowing his money on gambling. His domineering dad (Ciaran Hinds) hooks him up with legendary trainer Kevin Rooney (Aaron Eckhart), one of the wizards who helped channel Mike Tyson's rage. It's Rooney who recommends that Paz move up one weight class, a bold move. Everyone else in Paz's circle (including his manager\u00a0Lou Duva, played by gravel-voiced character actor Ted Levine, who's never looked worse or more weirdly compelling) thinks it's a bad idea. But it turns out to be a stroke of genius. Paz becomes not just a winner but a sensation, beating champ Roberto Duran (Edwin Rodriguez, radiating intelligence and focus) and priming himself for stardom. Advertisement Then he gets blindsided by life: a car slams into him head-on as he's driving to the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut and throws his vehicle into a ditch. His spine is damaged. He has to wear a \"halo\" to keep his head upright; it sits on his shoulders like scaffolding, but despite the theologically loaded name of the device, director Ben Younger (\"Boiler Room\") and cinematographer Larkin Seiple restrain themselves from playing up the Christ-crucified parallels that are sure to form in viewers' minds. The doctor tells him not only will he never fight again, he'll probably  never walk again. Undaunted, Paz charms Rooney into undertaking a secret training  regimen in his parents' basement, and the film becomes a recovery story. The emphasis is mainly on what the injury does to Paz's body, and how he manages and transcends the pain: a mind-over-matter narrative. The problem, though, is that we never get enough sense of Paz's interior life to judge this movie as anything other than a comeback story about a nice guy who got knocked out by the cosmos and hauled himself up. Its modesty is welcome, and its deep knowledge of boxing pictures and sports weepies helps the story glide along. Still, there's a deeper, more powerful tale here that remains frustratingly untapped, maybe because the film knows that if it got too messy, contradictory or raw, it would lose the \"inspirational\" label and become art. Many reviews of this film have complained about how predictable the story is, which seems like an odd complaint, given the script's basis in fact. But if you think of \"Bleed for This\" in terms of a commercial drama rather than as a simple story of a man rebuilding his life, you might have to admit they're on to something.  The direction, the photography, the editing, the production design and most of the performances are on point. And there are ways in which \"Bleed for This\" transcends cliche\u2014mainly in the sociological margins of the story. We get more journalistic details than pictures like this often provide: the scene-setting driving shots of Providence and leafy surrounding counties, the texture of the wood paneled walls in characters' homes, the cigarettes they smoke, the beer they drink, and the cadence of their talk, which often revolves around men expressing love by busting each other's chops. \"You get cable with that thing?\" Rooney asks Paz, indicating his halo. \"You got heart, kid,\" Duva tells Paz, \"but you wear it on your fuckin' chin.\" \u00a0 Advertisement The film excels in its portrayal of what it means to be injured. Too many boxing films downplay the fragility of the body, unless a hero is being warned that if he keeps fighting, he'll go blind or suffer brain damage (he always disregards the warning and wins anyway). The middle section of \"Bleed for This,\" which focuses on Paz and Rooney's secret rehab project, is an exception. We see Paz sneaking into the basement, gingerly sliding onto his weight bench, and trying to bench-press a barbell he hasn't touched in years, then removing weight after weight until only the bar remains. The first rule of rehab is \"start small.\" It's great to see a movie not only acknowledge this reality, but make the man embracing it seem heroic.\u00a0 But the movie has major problems. The biggest is Teller, a committed and likable actor miscast as Paz. You're aware of how hard he must have worked to get in shape, sell the accent, get the demeanor right, and so on, but he's never wholly credible as the hero. This performance feels built from without, not found within. Teller lacks the affable meathead quality that made Mark Wahlberg so compelling in \"The Fighter,\" the movie that this film's modern, white ethnic, working class setting evokes. He's just right in films like \"The Spectacular Now\" and \"Whiplash,\" playing nonviolent guys struggling with specific personal demons, but I never bought him here as an Italian-American, a guy with a working class sensibility, or a boxer who's driven and skilled enough to win five world titles in three different weight classes (lightweight, junior middleweight and super middleweight). He's bouncy, even chirpy, verging on Tom Hanks or John Cusack in light-comic-lead mode, and while he gets certain signatures right in the ring (such as Paz's whirligig punch) the editing and camerawork often seem to be doing too much of the work for him (when he throws a flurry of combinations, he looks like he's dog-paddling).  To be fair, the writing and filmmaking are probably as much at fault as Teller\u2014actors are only as good as their collaborators and their material\u2014but it's a debilitating strike against the movie. The supporting cast, though, is flawless, especially Katey Sagal as Paz's mom, who listens to fights from the next room because she can't bear to watch her boy get hit on TV, and Eckhart, whose transformation into Rooney is both emotionally and physically complete. He seems to have made himself shorter and changed his bone structure, which is not something they teach you at Stella Adler. When his character appeared onscreen for the first time, I mistook him for Dean Norris. Teller can't keep up with any of them. He's a promising junior welterweight, and this is a heavyweight cast. Advertisement The frame the movie puts around Paz's comeback is iffy, too. It's unabashed in telling us that Paz reset his life through optimism, stubbornness and hard work. There's no denying Paz's achievement, but it's one rarely shared by people who've suffered massive physical trauma, and it would've been nice if the film had acknowledged that. As is, there are scenes and moments (particularly during Paz's closing interview, a bewildering mistake) where \"Bleed for This\" seems to be suggesting that if Paz did it, you can, too, and if you can't, it's because you didn't try hard enough. That surely wasn't the point, but it's what comes across, and it gives what might otherwise have been a pretty good, occasionally inspired sports movie a sour aftertaste.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Big Short", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The pre-release buzz is true: This is not your father\u2019s\r\nfinancial crisis movie. Nor, for that matter, is it \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d\r\nThe money masters of the universe depicted in this film\u2014and while their stories\r\nare interconnected, their lives are not, necessarily\u2014barely drink a sufficient\r\namount of red wine to get a good buzz on. Their buzz derives from an enhanced\r\nsense of smell. The closest to a \u201cWolf\u201d-like character here is Ryan Gosling\u2019s\r\nJared Vennett, the most standard-issue suit-and-tie banking bro of the bunch,\r\nand part of his schtick is to stand in a conference room sniffing\r\nostentatiously because, yes, he smells money.  Advertisement The money smelt, and earned, by the adventurers of this\r\nstory of the real-life 2008 world economic meltdown is arguably tainted by bad\r\nkarma. Based on a book by Michael Lewis, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d is about how several\r\ntraders and hedge fund managers made fortunes because they saw that the housing\r\nmarket\u2019s decline would cause a collapse of bonds contrived from sub-prime\r\nmortgages. The terminology is both dry and dizzying, the machinations\r\nincredibly convoluted. The main thesis of the story, adapted for the screen by\r\ndirector Adam McKay and his co-screenwriter Charles Randolph, is that as\r\nbanking became the top industry of the United States, bankers deliberately\r\nconcocted Byzantine financial tools whose main function was to help the rich\r\nget richer and screw over the little guy. You can expect a lot of pushback\r\nagainst this film of the \u201cwhere do these affluent Hollywood types get off\r\ncriticizing income inequality\u201d but that won\u2019t mean the movie is wrong.  And it really is quite a movie: entertaining and engaging,\r\nbut also mortifying; a good alternate title might be \u201cAmerican Horror Story.\u201d The film intertwines\r\nthree discrete storylines. The first focuses on Christian Bale\u2019s Michael Burry,\r\na trained physician with very stunted social skills whose genius at analysis\r\nand numbers-crunching found him running a very successful West Coast hedge\r\nfund. After finding some terrifying data within the structures of a large\r\nnumber of mortgage bonds, he concocts a radical idea: to \u201cshort,\u201d that is, bet against,\r\nthe housing bond market, which the banks have puffed up as being unassailable.\r\nTo do this he has to convince those banks to create a new financial tool, a\r\nkind of bond insurance policy. If Burry\u2019s right and the market collapses, he\r\nand his hedge fund make stupid money. But for as long as the market stays\r\nstable, Burry and his fund are obliged to pay stupid money in premiums.  McKay is best known as the director of such comedic fare as\r\n\u201cAnchorman,\u201d and, for all the silly self-reflexive humor in those films, there\u2019s\r\na sly underlying intelligence animating them, and here that takes the form of\r\ncelebrity cameos wherein attractive people such as Margot Robbie and Selena\r\nGomez directly address the audience with cogent and colorful explanations of\r\nterms such as \u201csub-prime.\u201d He also enlists \u201cAnchorman\u201d rep company member Steve\r\nCarell for one main role, as financial Prophet of Doom Mark Baum, whose own\r\nfund gets a whiff of what Gosling\u2019s character is smelling and takes a piece of\r\nthe action, in a partial fit of \u201cscrew the system\u201d indignation. Carell\u2019s\r\nself-torturing character is likely the closest thing this movie has to a\r\ndirectorial surrogate. Finn Wittrock and John Magaro play a couple of Jim\r\nHenson\u2019s Hedge Fund Babies, mentored by Brad Pitt\u2019s Ben Rickert. Rickert\u2019s\r\ncharacter can be read as something of a slight sendup of Pitt\u2019s own current\r\ndo-gooder persona; he\u2019s a former master trader who left the game out of\r\ndisgust, and who preaches a hippie-ish quasi-survivalist gospel to his two\r\nyoung acolytes even as he helps them get pretty much super-rich. Advertisement I started off feeling skeptical about this movie: the\r\nhairstyles and clothes of the main characters were more \u201890s music-video than\r\nearly 2000s, and the sometimes-color-desaturated flashbacks to some characters\u2019\r\nback stories were a little on the drearily commonplace side. But the narrative\r\nmomentum, combined with the profane wit of much of the dialogue, and the\r\ncommitted acting going on beneath the hairpieces, all did their job. And they\r\ngot across the angry, pessimistic conviction behind the movie, which is that\r\nthe major banks all engaged in fraudulent, criminal activity, and that the U.S.\r\ngovernment bailed them out at the expense of the little guy, and that there\u2019s\r\nno indication that the banks aren\u2019t going to do something like the exact same\r\nthing all over again. You are free to disagree. But this is a movie that uses\r\nboth cinema art and irrefutable facts to make its case. It\u2019s strong stuff.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Jauja", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Jauja,\" a period drama set in Argentina's Patagonia region starring Viggo Mortensen, is one the most original and peculiar adventure films in recent memory; it's firmly in the wheelhouse of Argentinian director Lisandro Alonso's previous films (\"Los Muertos,\" \"Liverpool\"), and your your affinity for it will depend mainly on your willingness to roll with its style, tone and pace. You'll describe it as \"patient\" or \"deliberate\" if you like it, \"slow\" if you don't, \"gorgeous\" if it pleases you, \"pretentious\" or some-such otherwise. In any case, it's a rare film one can describe as a series of paintings come to life. Shot on 35mm film in 4x3 aspect ratio (the shape of old movies, complete with rounded frame-edges), it allows Alonso to further hone his style of picking a shot and sticking with it as long as he possibly can, while characters move slowly through the frame, or sit still and talk, or think, or be.  Advertisement There is a story: Danish Captain Gunnar Dinesen (Mortensen) leads a band of men assigned to kill Aboriginals living in the country's desert. During his sojourn there, his daughter, Ingeborg (Viilbj\u00f8rk Malling Agger), who is stationed with him, runs off with a young soldier named Corto (Misael Saavedra), causing Dinesen to take off in pursuit. This sounds like a variant of the Western wilderness-kidnap film, and the scenery certainly would seem ripe for that.  But Alonso and his cinematographer Timo Salminen aren't interested in traditional beats. As the story moves us from calm to violence and back to calm again at the end, the storytelling, indeed the cutting from scene to scene (there are few scenes with more than one shot), thwarts any expectations we carried into the film, not just in terms of story, but rhythm. You never know how long a shot will last or what it'll emphasize.  The movie opens with a static image of two characters sitting on a rock for several minutes, and continues that way even when the story allegedly kicks in and Dinesen rides off to find his daughter. A shocking act of violence is revealed as aftermath, and you don't even see the moment of discovery in closeup. A conversation between Dinesen and a hateful underling who describes the aboriginals as \"coconut-heads\" and blithely argues for their extermination is chilling not just because of the content of the conversation, but because of the way Alonso lets Dinesen exit the frame while staying on the underling for a long moment, letting us observe his utter disgust at a man who thinks less of him because he's a white supremacist.  As in films by Werner Herzog, Terrence Malick and Theo Angelopoulos, the filmmaking encourages us to think less about what motivates the characters (their drives are often hazy) than their existence within the context of a land and an era that is ultimately indifferent to their dramas. The slow (or \"deliberate\") pace makes the mind wander away from the absence of expected values and focus instead on the presence of ones you don't normally get from scripted features. You may find yourself noticing a soldier's blazing red trousers against the green lichens and thinking about how inappropriate, and somehow strangely arrogant, they are, and how this juxtaposition of colors seems to summarize the mentality of those who would try to invade and subjugate terrain they barely understand.  Advertisement The performances are entirely without vanity, including that of Mortensen, an international star who fits right into the period and seems unencumbered by contemporary neuroses (though the character has plenty from that era). The actor was born in New York City, spent his early childhood in Denmark but was raised in Argentina and speaks fluent Spanish; he would seem like a perfect fit for this extremely specific role even if he didn't have such extraordinary yet unaffected control over his face and body, always suggesting Dinesen's emotional interior but never indicating.  The performances mesh beautifully with the filmmaking, which is more keenly attuned to fluctuations in the natural world that all but a handful of modern motion pictures. The wind, the chirping birds, the gently lapping waves all center the mind, and this both amplifies the film's physical beauty and makes the increasingly shocking events seem eerier, more dreamlike. A title card informs us that Jauja is a fabled \"earthly paradise\" that many sought, and that they all \"got lost along the way.\" The getting lost part is key to the experience. The whole film feels purposefully unmoored. That might sound like an oxymoron if you haven't seen it, after which point it feels more like a reason for being. The final few shots assert the supremacy of nature and time over human concerns. Their spareness is haiku-like.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Quitters", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "It's not fun following teenage kid Clark (Ben Konigsberg) around for an hour and a half. Clark is the lead character in Noah Pritzker's debut feature \"Quitters\" (Pritzker co-wrote the script with Ben Tarnoff), and he is manipulative, passive-aggressive, and a user with zero sense of humor. Teenagers are often annoying, of course. And teenage angst and peer pressure and the newness of some experiences make them all act a little nuts. But Clark is a horse of a different color. Konigsberg, to his credit, does not soft-pedal any of Clark's personality flaws, a remarkable accomplishment for such a young actor. But, still, \"Quitters\" is a challenging and joyless experience. The title of the film is accurate. Everyone here quits: on themselves, on situations, doing drugs, staying in relationships. Considering his selfish parents, it's no wonder Clark has made an art out of bailing (often with great cruelty) when things get tough. Advertisement Clark's mother (Mira Sorvino) is in rehab for prescription-pill addiction. (\"Technically, your mother's not an addict. She has a 'dependency,'\", says Clark's weak stoner dad, played by Greg Germann). Clark has a crush on a classmate named Etta (Kara Hayward), and when she rebuffs his advances, he responds by dropping her as a friend via vicious condescending email, and then spreading rumors around school that she struggles with depression. Clark cannot stand his father, whom he treats with contemptuous superiority. Clark decides to quit his own awful family and become part of another. Crashing in the home of friend Natalia (Morgan Turner), he worms his way into the family's routines and, in a particularly bleak scene,\u00a0into Natalia's bed. Saffron Burrows and Scott Lawrence play the parents who welcome Clark into their home without once calling Clark's dad to see if it's okay. (It calls to mind that funny line from \"While You Were Sleeping\": \u201cLucy, you are born into a family. You do not join them like the Marines.\u201d)\u00a0 To be fair, \"Quitters\" does not plead with us to sympathize with Clark. Pritzker and Tarnoff present him in a very straightforward way, showing us what he does, how he does it and his emotional brutality. \"Quitters\" also does not turn him into a case study (his mother has a \"dependency\" and his dad's a loser, and that's why he's this way!) Clark is smart, but he is also lazy. He goes for what he wants, whether it's a condom he steals out of Natalia's mom's drawer, or challenging his teacher Mr. Becker (Kieran Culkin) to give him a better grade. Sorvino is great in the small role of Clark's tear-stained, checked-out mother, calling and texting him desperately from rehab, but detached from any sense of real responsibility. Kieran Culkin is equal parts disturbing and endearing as the schlubby Mr. Becker, such a different role than the one he just played in Todd Solondz's \"Wiener-Dog.\" Mr. Becker works on a novel in his off-hours, and seems like a big clueless kid himself, hanging out by the microwave, staring at it as it heats up his pizza. He's tough on his students, but he's weak too. You can practically see the broken dreams scattered around his feet shuffling down the hallway. Advertisement At a certain point, a pretty basic thought comes up: What exactly is the story being told here? The pedestrian style does not help. The scenes look like they're from a 1980s TV movie, with little to no imagination or tension in the editing or angles. A beautiful piano theme by David Shire is yearning, nostalgic, sweet, all qualities which do not enter into \"Quitter\"'s emotional landscape at all. Fictional characters, even leads, don't need to be \"relatable\" or likable. They don't even need to be sympathetic. What they need to be is watchable, which Konigsberg is. Watching him operate (he doesn't do it by stealth, he comes right out with it), is fascinating in a creepy way. He takes what he wants, walks away without blinking, and has no compunction about re-approaching people he's hurt if he then needs something from them. His rear view mirror is filled with burned bridges already. He's a sociopath in training. Very few actors can be both opaque and revealing at the same time. Alain Delon can do it, but that's a pretty high bar. Konigsberg struggles a little bit in that department. There are times when the camera lingers on his face, and there is nothing going on; it is impossible to tell what he's thinking. And it's impossible to tell if that's the point. It may very well be. The teenage discontent and rage plus Clark's runaway status calls to mind Holden Caulfield in \"Catcher in the Rye,\" but the comparison falls apart on closer examination. Holden had a sense of humor as well as at least being capable of intimate relationships with both of his siblings, dead and alive. Clark, following the example of his wretched parents, is already way beyond that. The more apt comparison would be Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley from her famous \"Ripley\" novels (Alain Delon, incidentally, in all his gorgeous chilly cunning, played Tom Ripley in \"Purple\u00a0Noon.\") Clark isn't as bad as Tom Ripley. Yet. Maybe he'll turn out okay. I doubt it, but maybe. Maybe he's just surrounded by\u00a0quitters, and he senses it, and he hates it. The film doesn't say.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Kings of Summer", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "High school student Joe (Nick Robinson) lives with his father (Nick Offerman), a stern man sitting on a volcano of anger. Joe's mother has died. He has an older sister (played by \"Mad Men\"'s Alison Brie), but she is engaged and out of the house. The tension between father and son is oppressive, and the rules feel arbitrary and unfair to Joe. During one night when the family gathers to play Monopoly, like they used to do when Mom was alive, the tension explodes. Joe didn't want to play anyway, he wanted to go to a party with his friends. After a fight with his dad, Joe ends up calling the police, claiming physical abuse. It's a radical move, dark and evocative of a deep psychological schism. There's a furious and smart movie inside \"The Kings of Summer,\" a first feature by director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, a film about three teenage boys who take to the woods to build a house from scratch and live outside not only parental supervision but community norms and expectations. Unfortunately, despite some beautiful sequences and solid acting, the script by first-timer Chris Galletta pulls its punches, over-explains the emotional meaning of its moments, and tries to lighten the mood in sometimes awkward sit-com-style ways, betraying the movie's more honest spirit. \"The Kings of Summer\" flirts with profundity, seeming to yearn for it and fear the honest expression of it at the same time. There is much here to admire, but the overall impression is of a film that does not have the courage of its convictions. Advertisement Joe and his buddy Patrick (played by the open-faced and extremely talented Gabriel Basso) have been friends since childhood. Joe has issues with his father, and Patrick is heckled and cooed over by his intrusive well-meaning parents (played, hilariously, by Megan Mullally and Marc Evan Jackson). Nothing seems bad enough here to warrant anyone running away, but \"The Kings of Summer,\" to its credit, is going after a deeper more existential truth, common to most coming-of-age movies, the fact that teenagers are not only looking for freedom, but meaning in their lives. They want to be free to feel deeply, to connect to themselves in respect to their environments, and to choose a life that suits them. One night, after a party, Joe and another kid, a bizarre human being named Biaggio (Moises Arias, who is phenomenal in the role) get lost coming home through the woods. They come upon an open glade, dark and mysterious in the moonlight, so beautiful that the two boys stop dead in their tracks. Joe gets the idea to remove himself from his father's home, and build a house in the woods with Patrick. Biaggio, since he was there that first night, is along for the ride. Patrick bones up on survivalist books from the library, treating the project seriously, liking the image of freedom and manliness that Joe paints for him. They draw floor plans, they pilfer materials from construction sites, they spend their days out in the woods building their house. And then, one night, all three sneak away from home and move in. The community, of course, thinks they have been kidnapped and two cops (Mary Lynn Rajskub and Thomas Middleditch, both fantastic) are assigned to investigate. The parents back home wonder what they did, and Joe's dad, in one awful line, confesses to Patrick's dad, \"I think I've broken my son.\" Meanwhile, out in the woods, the three boys revel in an unfettered life, trying to catch fish and other critters, so that they will be entirely self-sufficient. Joe makes many speeches about masculinity, the script constantly reminding us of the themes underlying the adventure. Advertisement There are some good scenes where we see that a geographical change does not necessarily solve your problems. Patrick tries to tell the other boys not to litter, because it will attract animals, and Joe blows off the advice, annoyed at being told what to do. Joe has a crush on a girl, Kelly (Erin Moriarty), and despite their rule of telling no one about their Swiss Family Robinson/Moonrise Kingdom situation, Joe caves and invites her to visit. She brings a couple of friends. Over a night around the campfire, it becomes clear that Kelly is falling for Patrick, not Joe. Joe reacts with jealousy and rage, exploding at Patrick, referring to Kelly as a \"bitch\", and behaving like the worst kind of emotional bully. As a matter of fact, the contempt he shows for both of them is reminiscent of his father's cold judgmental attitude. If this is what \"being masculine\" means to Joe, it is, perhaps understandable, due to his father's poor example, but the film does not delve deeper into it. It is a giant missed opportunity. Patrick, on the other hand, seems to have a comfort with himself that is natural and easy, igniting Joe's envy. There is a beautiful random shot, unconnected to any other scene, of Patrick sitting in the woods by himself playing a mournful tune on a violin. It's gorgeously shot, and one of the few scenes where everyone is not talking about what everything means. While sitting around the campfire with the girls, we see Patrick going out of his way to make Kelly laugh. Again, the script trembles on the edge of profundity here, making acute observations about different aspects of masculinity, one of them being the ability to include women in that male circle, and to do so without hostility. Lightening the mood with humor is important to such potentially painful material, and there are a couple of legitimately hilarious scenes, mostly involving the self-serious behavior of the two cops, Patrick's parents' comedy routine with one another, and Biaggio's deadpan line delivery. But some of the schtick feels either forced or unfocused, one exchange about cystic fibrosis in particular. Lines from Biaggio like \"I don't see myself as having a gender\" or \"I can read. I just can't cry\" are not explored in a meaningful way. His words are treated as one-liners, tossed off to make an audience laugh, and never visited again, but they act as glimpses of the more honest and interesting movie that could have been. And Joe, who behaves poorly out there in the woods, never seems to come to a realization that he needs to take responsibility for his behavior. Being a man, being an adult, doesn't just mean doing whatever the hell you want to do. The script shies away from its own implications. Advertisement  Vogt-Roberts' direction is often evocative and beautiful, bordering on the surreal at times, his filming of their first glimpse of the glade by moonlight a perfect example. The montage of the boys building the shack in the woods is energetic and emotional. He has a good eye for the interesting, for the unusual image. The over-written script is to blame here. It wants to make sure we get the symbols and metaphors going on, but it also doesn't want to be caught taking itself too seriously. This is an error. Peter Bogdanovich once asked John Wayne about his famously bold gestures onscreen, and Wayne replied, \"I think that's the first lesson you learn in a high school play \u2014 that if you're going to make a gesture, make it.\" \"The Kings of Summer\" should take that advice. You have a gesture you want to make, so make it.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Den of Thieves", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The first thing you should know about this movie is that, yup, it really is two hours and twenty minutes long. A fellow reviewer and I were discussing the timing given by the IMDb and we both thought, no way can this probably relatively dinky cops-and-robbers picture be almost two and a half hours. But it is. \u201cDen of Thieves\u201d opens with some text explaining just how many bank robberies occur in Los Angeles California over the span of one year\u2014broken down by months, days, hours, and minutes. Having rolled out the stats, and they are impressive, the text concludes that \u201cLos Angeles in the bank robbery capital of the world.\u201d Already one feels the movie, co-written and directed by Christian Gudegast, is doing some kind of special pleading. There are four million stories in this naked city, and not all of them can be \u201cHeat,\u201d but this one is KINDA like that, okay? Advertisement Indeed, the movie begins with crime that\u2019s committed like a paramilitary operation. An armored car stops at a donut place and an SUV full of masked men armed to the teeth swoop in on it. A dropped coffee sets off a trigger-happy heist man, and a near-massacre ensues. This crew didn\u2019t want it that way, but as its mastermind, Merriman (Pablo Schreiber) glumly notes when they\u2019ve gotten to safety, \u201cNow we\u2019re cop-killers.\u201d And they did it all for an empty truck.\u00a0 That\u2019s one of the things that Gerard Butler\u2019s \u201cBig\u201d Nick Davis, the major crimes cop on the scene, has to figure out. He runs a half-rogue crew he calls \u201cThe Regulators,\u201d and they\u2019re not above kidnapping and torturing suspected perps to get their men. Butler, sporting a slightly unruly beard, plays the role as if he\u2019s imitating Mel Gibson during his drunk driving arrest. He\u2019s crude, boorish, and cavalier. Genre mavens will see where Gudegast, who wrote Butler\u2019s last film, \u201cLondon Has Fallen\u201d and is making his feature directorial debut here, is pulling his threads from. The Neal/Vincent dynamic of \u201cHeat\u201d isn\u2019t duplicated here; it\u2019s more like the Chance/Masters dynamic in \u201cTo Live And Die In L.A.,\u201d in which cop and criminal dealt in the same kind of corruption but the criminal was ultimately the more ethically pure of the two. Thing is, though, \u201cDen of Thieves\u201d never really gets that deep, and turns out not to be all that terribly serious a movie anyway. The various character dynamics are almost a smokescreen for a convoluted heist targeting the only bank in Los Angeles that has never been robbed: the branch of the Federal Reserve where, among other things, old money is destroyed around the same time as the serial numbers attached to it are erased.\u00a0 The plot thickens ...\u00a0and thickens ...\u00a0and thickens. Gudegast is clearly an avid student of heist pictures, and he layers this one with a lot of spectacular complications even while he muddles the average viewer\u2019s potential rooting interest. As charismatic as Schreiber\u2019s gangleader and the criminal lieutenant played by Curtis \u201c50 Cent\u201d Jackson can be (Gudegast engineers a scene involving Jackson\u2019s character\u2019s daughter going on a prom date for a comic-relief \u201cdad gives the date a talking to\u201d scene), they\u2019re still guys who blew away almost a dozen cops in the opening scene, so the suspense when they\u2019re finally inside the Fed building and almost pulling things off is potentially slightly compromised. As for Butler\u2019s Nick, yeah, he\u2019s consistently asking for a spanking to say the least. But where Gudegast really shows his hand, if you\u2019re in the mood to stay ahead of this movie, is in the casting. There\u2019s one character, played by an actor of star-quality charisma, who keeps getting put off to the side in the story, and you have to wonder why. Once you\u2019ve decided why, you can figure out at least one of the twists. And of course, the actor, who I won\u2019t name, is winning enough that you suddenly understand exactly where your rooting interest was supposed to have been all along.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Gimme the Loot", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Somebody's gonna bomb that Apple.\" The Apple in question is the Mets' Citi Field's Home Run Apple, which has never been \"bombed\" by graffiti in its entire history and therefore represents the Holy Grail to New York graffiti artists. If you could somehow get access to that Home Run Apple, and \"bomb\" it, your work would be broadcast to the masses and you'd be a legend! \"Bombing the Apple\" is the lofty goal of Sofia (Tashiana Washington) and Malcolm (Ty Hickson), the two young Bronx graffiti artists in \"Gimme the Loot,\" writer/director Adam Leon's first feature. And what a confident and entertaining first feature it is. Filmed all over the city, it shows a New York that has been missing from American cinema for quite some time. It is an anti-glamorous New York that still exists: grimy delis with cashiers hidden behind plate-glass, black-top parks with ferocious basketball games in progress, the languid crowded torpor of Union Square on a hot summer night. The locations are used offhandedly, although there are a couple of scenes that reach a kind of poetry (one involving a water tower). The characters, sometimes in long-shot, stroll through a cityscape that throbs with a palpable pulse of overpopulation and noise.  Advertisement We don't know much about the home lives of Sofia and Malcolm, although we can assume that things are pretty rough. Roughness, however, does not define them. They spend their time tagging walls and roofs in their neighborhood, coming up with designs, and plotting to raise the $500 that will give them off-hours access to the Home Run Apple at Citi Field. They are engaged in a mild turf war with other graffiti artists, who spray over their designs. They make a great team.  Director Leon said he was inspired by comedies like \"Uptown Saturday Night,\" as well as the Bob Hope/Bing Crosby road movies. Watching Malcolm and Sofia roam around the city, arguing, plotting, harassing each other, but with a clear undercurrent of fondness coursing beneath, is the main delight of the film. The two are accustomed to having to act tough, but there are a couple of electrically tender moments where you get the sense that, really, they should just get it over with and start kissing immediately.  \"Gimme the Loot\" is thrilling, although there aren't any stereotypically \"thrilling\" sequences. The thrill comes from the compulsively watchable dynamic between the two leads (non-professional actors, both of them), the excellent supporting cast (also non-professionals), and the fun use of multiple locations throughout the bustling metropolis. \"Gimme the Loot\" is really about class -- a serious issue, obviously, as the gap between the haves and have-nots widens almost perceptibly. The fact that Sofia and Malcolm view the $500 as nearly impossible to acquire is eloquent.   Malcolm sells dope to finance his work with Sofia. Ty Hickson, a young man born and raised in Harlem, has a beautiful humorous energy, and a visceral openness to the camera, rare in a non-professional actor, but rare with professionals as well. He is emotionally transparent. Watch his face, watch his reactions; he is always listening, always thinking. There is a standout scene where he delivers marijuana to a rich white girl (Zoe Lescaze), lolling about in her parents' apartment. She is bored, mischievous, and wants to talk. As Sofia rages around their Bronx neighborhood far uptown, trying to raise money, Malcolm starts kissing the rich girl, her bed surrounded by a decor of dead bats and creepy skulls (\"You price a skull by the number of the teeth,\" the girl informs Malcolm) and he confesses to Sofia later, \"I fell in love today.\" You believe him. He acts like a stud, but he's not fooling anyone. Sofia, startled, starts lecturing him about condom use, as they cross Union Square.  Advertisement Malcolm may have fallen in love, but he also couldn't help but notice that the rich girl had a glass case on her desk filled with vintage jewelry. This could be the windfall he and Sofia so desperately need. There is one masterfully suspenseful sequence where Sofia is sent to follow the rich girl on her daily run, while Malcolm and an older criminal-type named Champion (Meeko), try to pick the giant lock in the penthouse stairwell to the girl's apartment. Poor Sofia trails after the rich girl on what appears to be an endless run, chasing her across avenues, along the East River, through parks, up and down stairs.  Meanwhile, Champion and Malcolm get off to a rough start because they are not sure what floor they are on. Does the ground floor count as \"1\"? Is the second floor actually the first floor? Champion, covered in tattoos and handsome in an intimidating and tough way, says to Malcolm, \"Okay, let's start from scratch\" and they head back down the stairwell again to count their way back up. Specific details like this one give the film its personality and comedy. Nothing goes smoothly, especially when you dream big.  Although money is the driving force in everyone's lives here (even the rich girl, who dismisses Malcolm in a painful later scene when she is surrounded by her upscale friends), it's the hustle, the \"gimme\" of the title that provides the adrenaline rush, not the loot itself, not even the oasis-mirage of a bombed Home Run Apple being broadcast to Mets fans everywhere.  Adam Leon has created something unique and current, with affectionate nods to New York films of the past. The soundtrack is superb, filled with doo-wop and R&B numbers that soar with nostalgia for a time gone by. His young cast inhabits the world of the film like a well-worn pair of sneakers. \"Gimme the Loot\" is successful on every level, and won the Grand Jury Prize at the SXSW. It is thrilling to contemplate what Leon will do next. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Trophy", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Grown men cry in \"Trophy,\" a documentary about the wildlife hunting  industry. One is a manager at a big game preserve who takes tourists to  shoot African elephants. He's a big, tough-looking fellow, but as he  talks about the emotional bonding that occurs between humans and  animals, he bursts into tears, asks the filmmakers to cut, then leaves  the frame, embarrassed. Another is a wildlife control officer and  dedicated anti-poacher who sometimes has to kill exotic animals anyway  because they're threatening locals or endangering livestock. He seems to  get choked up talking about the experience. \"It's an emotional thing,  killing an animal,\" he says, then goes on to speculate that for hunters,  that emotion, and the accompanying rush of adrenaline, becomes an  addiction that can only be satisfied by shooting more animals. This same  movie starts with a Texas sheep breeder named Phillip Glass (no, not  that one) helping his young son take down first buck. A ritual that may  be horrifying to some is sacred to these two. Later, the father relates a  childhood anecdote: when he was a boy, his mother warned him never to  kill a redbird, and he immediately went out and did it anyway, and as he  stared at the corpse, \"I realized that I could not have loved that  redbird more, even though it was dead.\"  Advertisement Evenhanded is not the  right word for \"Trophy,\" a movie by Shaul Schwarz and Christina Clusiau  (who are also the cinematographers). Though created with the latest  moviemaking technology, including high-definition, lightweight cameras  attached to drones, this is an old school documentary that considers an  issue, the various people involved in it, and the communities and  nations they inhabit. It is not a position paper but a work of curiosity  and intelligence, filled with sublime and horrifying images. Shot with  an ominously gliding camera that revels in the beauty of rhinos,  elephants, lions and other rare animals and scrutinizes the map of each  face that tells a story in front of it, \"Trophy\" strives to be kind and  fair. But it is unmerciful in its exploration of the hunting business.  Like a ruthless lawyer, it loves poking holes in arguments that appear  rock-solid. The mystical-sentimental justifications for  killing penned-in animals are belied by footage of canned hunts\u2014in  particular one that ends with a ranch employee dragging a wounded  crocodile from a man-made lake so that an American hunter can shoot it to death and shout, \"Yeah, motherfucker!\" (Before taking the  kill shot, he pauses to put his beer down on the grass.) But there's  also acknowledgment throughout that you can't just say \"shooting animals  is evil\" and be done with it, because there are too many factors at  play.  One is the existence of multibillion-dollar meat and  egg industries built upon a foundation of prolonged, scientifically  refined forms of torture. Some subjects in \"Trophy\" argue that if the only  way to prevent African big game from going extinct is to transform them  into glorified free-range farm animals, rarer but no less domesticated than sheep or cows, then that's what should be done. \"Give me  [the name of] one animal that went extinct while farmers were breeding  it,\" asks\u00a0South African rhino rancher John Hume. \"There's not one.\" It may seem repugnant to use the profits derived from shooting  animals to protect those same animals, but as Hume says near the start of  the film, after watching his ranch hands drug a rhino and preemptively cut off its horn to make it unattractive to poachers, \"If  [this animal] had an opinion to give you, he would probably say 'I'm  happy to sacrifice my horn to save my life.'\" Advertisement Then there's the  vise-grip of the global marketplace, which drives many poor Africans to  poach for meat or to sell prized trophies (such as rhino horns) on the  black market, where they can fetch a higher price per gram than heroin  or gold. Every decision made in relation to hunting affects someone,  often adversely. The lingering stench of colonialism hovers over every  sentence uttered onscreen.  One long, wrenching sequence in \"Trophy\"  shows a white anti-poacher leading a team onto a nearby farmhouse to  look for a black man suspected of poaching, then intimidating a group of  young suspected poachers by warning them that if they keep doing this,  they could end up getting shot by somebody like him. But the visuals in  these scenes and others are politically charged, in ways that the  filmmakers seem keenly aware of. In Africa, in North America,  everywhere, it's usually white people (on both sides of the issue)  telling black people, often poor ones, what they can or can't do with  wild animals. As sympathetic as we might be towards exotic creatures and  the humans who adore them, it's still chilling to see a beefy white man  barge into a tiny black woman's house in the middle of the night, shine  a flashlight in her face, and force her to lie in the dirt while he  interrogates her. \"He's a bad guy, and he's done bad things,\" the  wildlife officer says of her husband. \"Please don't beat me,\" she asks. The  movie seems like a roughly assembled collection of scenes, arranged in  an \"on the one hand/on the other hand\" manner. But if you pay attention  not just to what's being said but how the film is structured and which sentiments get repeated, you realize that the  filmmakers are building rather masterfully towards a central argument  that encompasses every person and point-of-view.  This entire story is about capitalism run amok. Whatever makes money is going to happen one way or another, no matter what laws are passed, no matter what lofty sentiments are expressed, no matter what justifications people on various sides of an issue give for whatever they believe. What's ultimately at stake here is the question of whether \"the  commodification of wildlife,\" as one activist puts it, is morally much  worse than the commodification of everything else on the planet, including human life\u2014and  whether we need to be less idealistic about solutions, now that we appear  to be barreling towards some kind of global political and environmental reckoning.  The  human species has been altering, processing, consuming and destroying  nature to suit its own ends, often with specious religious or political  justifications, since the dawn of civilization. The technology has just  become more efficient. The recent push to restrict or end hunting is  occurring against the backdrop of a natural landscape that might have  ceased to exist without the subsidies of hunters and people  catering to hunters, the same group whose urge to kill thinned the rhino population from 500,000 in 1900 to about 30,000 today. And some believe that the only way to keep rhinos and other species alive is to continue catering to the same humans who nearly wiped them out.  Advertisement This may seem like a horrendous conundrum, but it's  real, it's not going away, and a good part of the running time of \"Trophy\" is dedicated to  exploring it. Ecologist Chris Packer tells the filmmakers  that he thinks canned hunts are less defensible than the European and  American-dominated safaris that thinned the African game population a  hundred years ago, because prior generations of hunters would track a lone animal through the jungle or across the plains for weeks,  while rich tourists might shoot several animals at once on a ranch, so fast that their beer is still cold when they pose for celebratory pictures. But if  you're killing an animal with a gun, often from so far away that it  doesn't even know you're there, why be incremental with your  condemnation or approval? If rhinos, elephants, lions and the like are  almost certain to be wiped out by poachers if controlled hunting isn't  allowed, then shouldn't societies allow it?  Outside of a safari industry convention in Las Vegas, a protester holds  up a sign that reads \"Killing isn't conservation.\" But it is. The entire  running time of \"Trophy\" is dedicated to examining how both sentiments  can be true. This is a brilliant, maddening, necessary movie.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Starred Up", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "From the very first shot, there\u2019s tension humming underneath\r\nthe phenomenal \u201cStarred Up\u201d that only intensifies as the characters deepen. The\r\nopening shot is shaky, reflecting both movement and the disorientation that\r\ncomes with change. And the eyes of Jack O\u2019Connell, a future star if ever I\u2019ve\r\nseen one, are tight and coiled, first looking down to gather his thoughts and\r\nthen glaring up at the unknown future of his destination. We see this young man\r\ngoing through the process of moving from juvenile care to being admitted to an\r\nadult prison, and it ends with his hands on his head and face. From there, in a\r\nnew cell he\u2019ll occupy for what feels like a long time, he does push-ups, he\r\ncrafts a shiv, he paces like a caged animal\u2014all before a single line of\r\ndialogue. Director David Mackenzie trusts his actor and O\u2019Connell puts more\r\nperformance up there on the screen in body language than most performers do\r\nwith an entire script. It\u2019s almost ten minutes before he speaks (and even that,\r\nto be fair, is so heavily accented and mumbled that I\u2019m not sure I could tell\r\nyou what he says), but we know Eric already through visual composition,\r\nphysical performance, and the other tools that average films often ignore in\r\nfavor of over-expository dialogue and false declarations of emotion. \u201cStarred\r\nUp\u201d is not an average film. Advertisement It\u2019s hard to describe \u201cStarred Up\u201d without making it sound\r\ngeneric. It\u2019s another prison drama, a genre that felt exhausted many, many\r\nyears ago. And it\u2019s another tale of a genetic predisposition for violence as we\r\nsoon learn that Eric\u2019s father Neville (the great Ben Mendelsohn of \u201cThe Place\r\nBeyond the Pines\u201d and \u201cAnimal Kingdom\u201d) is in the same prison as his son.\r\nNeville first spies Eric across the yard and glares him down in the way a\r\ndisappointed parent does before a beating. Eric has been thrown into an ultra-violent,\r\nalpha male world, and it\u2019s not one where having your father around is\r\nnecessarily a good thing. Human connection, for both of these men, will prove\r\nto be a double-edged sword. In many ways, it\u2019s a work about a father\u2019s anger\r\nthat both protects and derails his son.  Eric will have another father figure in his life, a group\r\ntherapist named Oliver (Rupert Friend), who convinces the prison Governor (Sam\r\nSpruell) to give the young man a chance at rehabilitation after a particularly\r\nviolent incident. In group sessions that almost always end in outbursts and\r\nviolence, Oliver does his best to try a different parental tactic with Eric.\r\nThere\u2019s a defining scene in which Eric flouts authority by lighting up a\r\ncigarette in group and Oliver tries discipline\u2014verbal admonition and\r\nessentially putting the group in a \u201ctime out\u201d\u2014before Neville bursts in with the\r\nphysical response: \u201cProblem is you\u2019ve got\r\nto come down on him full throttle; else it won\u2019t register.\u201d It\u2019s corporal\r\npunishment versus detention even in the prison system. The dynamic between a\r\nbiological father and a father figure behind bars is fascinating; both men try\r\nto protect him and both simply cannot in this kind of world. While all of that subtext makes \u201cStarred Up\u201d fascinating, it\r\nis primarily a character piece for the young Mr. O\u2019Connell, an actor who\r\nreminds one of Tom Hardy in \u201cBronson\u201d or the early work of Ryan Gosling in his\r\nfearlessness. There\u2019s a scene early on in which Eric knows the guards are\r\ncoming for him. He races back to his cell, pours oil on the floor, and then\r\ndouses himself in the stuff too. It\u2019ll make it harder to take him down. And he\r\ngrabs a couple of wooden planks for good measure. He\u2019s not getting \u201cout.\u201d They\r\nhave nightsticks, helmets and shields. But he\u2019ll do some damage on his way\r\ndown. \u201cStarred Up\u201d is a film about someone sliding out of society, and kicking,\r\nscreaming and punching as he does so. And O\u2019Connell captures that in a way that\r\nso many more experienced, well-known actors would miss. It\u2019s in the incredible\r\nphysical balance between prison-earned toughness and youth. There\u2019s just a hint of fear in O\u2019Connell\u2019s\r\neyes, reminding us that he was just a kid not that long ago. O\u2019Connell\u2019s\r\nperformance is matched but never upstaged by the increasingly fantastic Ben\r\nMendelsohn, an even more blatantly conflicted blend of rage and familial concern,\r\nand Rupert Friend. Advertisement \u201cStarred Up\u201d is HEAVY with slang and accents. You won\u2019t\r\nunderstand a third of it. But there\u2019s so much going on in between the lines of\r\ndialogue that you won\u2019t care. We\u2019ve seen many visually arresting films in\r\nrecent years and character studies are as common as film festivals, but it\u2019s\r\nthe remarkable blend of the two here that makes \u201cStarred Up\u201d devastating. From Mackenzie\u2019s\r\ncamera choices\u2014often tracking in one shot from relative calm like inmates\r\nplaying ping pong to an outburst in the distance down the hall\u2014to the sound\r\ndesign of clanking metal doors and distant cries, \u201cStarred Up\u201d is a technical achievement\r\nanchored by the clarity of character in O\u2019Connell\u2019s performance.

Nearly.\r\nHaving adored Daly\u2019s wonderful coming-of-age-meets-fairy-tale film \u201cKisses,\u201d I\r\nwas hoping for a bit more of that magic in \u201cBreeze,\u201d and, other than the\r\naforementioned two performances, one has to dig through too many false, forced\r\ncomedy beats to find them here. Advertisement Nan (Flanagan) is a good old-fashioned Irish hoarder. The Dublin\r\nresident has never been much trouble to her neighbors and generally keeps to\r\nherself. Her unemployed son Colm (Pat Shortt) joins forces with his other\r\nfamily members to give Nan a gift she could never give herself\u2014a clean house.\r\nNiece Emma (Thornton) takes Nan out for the day, and they return to a spotless\r\nhome. Old Chinese takeout menus, newspapers, broken kitchen appliances and an\r\noutdated TV: all gone. So is the old mattress Nan has been sleeping on for\r\ndecades. And shoving her money in because she doesn\u2019t trust the banks. That\u2019s\r\nright: there\u2019s a million Euros in a mattress now winding its way through the\r\nDublin recycling system. A wacky journey to find it ensues. Sort of. While \u201cLife\u2019s a Breeze\u201d has an undeniably sitcomish\r\npresence, it\u2019s almost as if the realist in Daly refuses to embrace the\r\npotentially wacky set-up. And so we\u2019re stuck with a film somewhere in the\r\nmiddle. It's not as offensively slapstick-y as it could have been but it's not realism either. It's caught in the boring center of those two ends of the spectrum. To be fair, character beats between Flanagan and Thornton, particularly in the\r\nfinal act, are truly effective. Flanagan has always been a performer who can do\r\na lot with very little, and Thornton has the kind of natural screen presence\r\nthat announces someone on the film scene. She\u2019s the one performer here who\r\ntruly feels in the moment; at least partially because it feels like she\u2019s the\r\none character Daly truly likes. Daly\u2019s skill with slice of life connects in the scenes between\r\nNan and Emma, and they nearly justify the piece in just a few truthful glances. These are two\r\ninteresting characters brought to life by intriguing actresses. Too bad there\r\nisn\u2019t anything in \u201cLife\u2019s a Breeze\u201d to support them.

{"Title": "Welcome to Leith", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "How far do you stretch the definition of acceptance of other\u2019s\r\nbeliefs and free speech? We all like to think that we would allow all\r\ndifferences of opinion, personality, and character to stand, proudly quoting\r\nthe First Amendment as we watch Neo-Nazis march down Main Street. Really think\r\nabout it though. What if your neighbor patrolled the perimeter of his property\r\nwith a loaded shotgun? What if he came to city council meetings and verbally\r\nharassed people to such a degree that nothing was out of bounds, including\r\nmocking the murder of a council member\u2019s daughter? What if he preached hate and\r\nintolerance, and threatened to turn your neighborhood into one of the\r\nfrontlines for the battle for White Power? Would you really live and let live?  Advertisement These were the questions faced by the two dozen (literally,\r\nPopulation 24) residents of Leith, North Dakota, and deftly chronicled in\r\nMichael Beach Nichols and Christopher K. Walker\u2019s unsettling and downright\r\ndepressing \u201cWelcome to Leith.\u201d When Craig Cobb became the 25th\u00a0resident of Leith, it became a national story. At first, no one really noticed\r\nthe grizzled old man who started buying up empty lots in an area of the country\r\ndescribed as \u201cB-roll for The Walking Dead.\u201d\r\nThen Cobb made his presence known, announcing to the other members of the White\r\nPower Movement\u2014for which he had been an outspoken leader\u2014that he was basically\r\ntaking over Leith. He invited people who believed as he did to move to\r\nLeith, hoping to turn the city into a compound for his\r\norganization, dominating votes on the city council and building monuments to his movement. When Cobb\u2019s allies started buying the lots from him, and one\r\nnotable skinhead and his wife even moved in, the locals started to panic. Nichols and Walker are careful to allow Cobb\u2019s words and\r\nactions to demonize him more than their filmmaking. It would have been easy to\r\nsensationalize this story\u2014using true crime documentary camera techniques to\r\nreally turn up the heat on Cobb\u2019s rhetoric. Instead, they merely spent as much\r\ntime with the aggravator as possible, watching him torment people at city\r\ncouncil meetings and swear at his neighbors. They carefully avoid making \u201cWelcome\r\nto Leith\u201d about what Cobb believes in, focusing on how those beliefs impact a\r\ncommunity more than the hatred and vitriol within them. To that end, they\r\nsurprisingly avoid much conversation with the only minority in Leith, who\r\nhappens to be the man who sold Cobb the property in the first place. Other\r\nfilmmakers would have made that the\r\nstory of \u201cWelcome to Leith.\u201d It\u2019s easy to make a documentary about hateful\r\npeople. It\u2019s harder to focus on the impact of hateful people on those around them. To that end, the creators of \u201cLeith\u201d spend an\r\nequal amount of time with Cobb and his cohorts as they do the residents of\r\nLeith, resulting in a notable balance in this portrait of a community. Again,\r\nbeing a strong proponent of free speech, I would never deny Cobb his right to\r\nbelieve what he does, and I find outspoken people like him less terrifying most\r\nof the time than those who hide their disgusting beliefs. At least we know\r\nwhere Cobb is and what he thinks. But Nichols and Walker raise fascinating\r\nquestions about just how much disagreement and hatred we\u2019re willing to accept\r\nfrom our neighbors, and they do so without much flair or over-direction. They\r\nprovide what we hope to get from films about small communities\u2014sketch it in\r\nsuch a way that the local story becomes one in which we can see universal\r\nissues. What happened in Leith could happen in hundreds of small towns across\r\nthe country, and, in many ways, is happening in major ones too, as hateful\r\npeople move in next to those they hate. As the world gets more crowded and\r\nintolerance shows no signs of dissipating, what we will do when we see a bit of\r\nthe drama in Leith in our own cities? Or maybe it's too late to even ask that question. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Trust", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Since the passing of this website\u2019s founder in 2013, this website has reviewed nine films starring Nicolas Cage. I have reviewed one-third of them. No other critic on this website has reviewed more than one. Perhaps you remember the opening line of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cIdiot Wind.\u201d If not, you can Google it. But never mind. The point is, now that I\u2019m reviewing my FOURTH Nicolas Cage movie for this website, I sometimes do think \u201csomeone\u2019s got it in for me.\u201d\u00a0 \n However. I can\u2019t complain too much, not only because nobody really cares anyway but also because this latest Nicolas Cage movie, \u201cThe Trust,\u201d is actually a moderately entertaining heist movie featuring an animated and reasonably diverting Eccentric Cage Performance. The debut feature of brother filmmaking team Alex and Benjamin Brewer, \u201cThe Trust\u201d casts Cage as a seemingly earnest and beleaguered Las Vegas cop. Assembling evidence with his team at a crime scene, he observes \u201cThis is a very interesting ashtray,\u201d before being called outside by a superior officer. Thinking his boss is ready to hear some exciting stuff about his evidence findings, he\u2019s disappointed to find out that the guy just wants him to take a John Deere vehicle off the police auction block so he can make a gift of it to his son-in-law. Las Vegas must be a very movie-friendly city to allow its Finest to be portrayed as such nincompoops.\u00a0 Advertisement \n In any event, Cage\u2019s Stone turns out to not be so honest as that, because upon finding a bail slip showing a certified-check payment on a $200,000 fee to spring a relative criminal nobody, he smells a rat and/or a source of illicit cash. He inveigles his disillusioned, largely stoned-out colleague Waters into a little extra-curricular investigation. What they find\u2014a highly-protected vault overseen by drug dealers, or so it seems\u2014startles and entices them. Soon Stone is on the phone to Cologne, Germany, talking high-tolerance drill bits with experts, consulting his German phrasebook all the while. Things get a little less funny when they get to the spot where they hope to drill around the vault\u2019s security, and find the place occupied by not one but two bystanders.\u00a0 \n Not content to merely be brother filmmakers, the Brewers wear their Coen influence on their sleeves. It\u2019s not just the casting of Cage, but the attempted wryness of the dialogue (\u201cYou can\u2019t walk around dressed like a cop.\u201d \u201cBut I AM a cop,\u201d and so on), the confident visual styling, and more. These elements are pretty entertaining as far as they go, especially when Cage is getting his groove on, as when his character tries to convince Waters that a lemon wedge drizzled with hot sauce is a genuine treat. But certain stuff falls flat: it might have seemed like a quirky move to cast Jerry Lewis in the role of Cage\u2019s father, but the 90-year-old icon is only in the film long enough for you to point to the screen and ask, \u201cIs that Jerry Lewis?\u201d\u00a0 \n And the movie gets a lot less interesting once it starts to go dark, so to speak, and the elements of the story that you had identified as red herrings earlier on turn out to be, yup, red herrings. At this point Cage\u2019s performance has settled into a kind of forced oddness, as in his reading of the line, \u201cI have an idea. It\u2019s kind of \u2026 WACKY.\u201d He says it pretty much exactly as you\u2019d predict.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "I Am Not Madame Bovary", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Director Feng Xiaogang's \"I Am Not Madame\u00a0Bovary,\" with Fan Bingbing as the central character, is not a re-telling of Gustave Flaubert's vicious send-up of the French bourgeoisie. As the male voiceover informs us at the outset, as though he is launching a solemn bedtime story, the film is based on a 17th-century Chinese morality tale about an unfaithful wife named Pan Jinlian who conspires with her lover to kill Pan Jinlian's husband. And ever since that day, \"bad\" women, are referred to as \"Pan Jinlian.\" It is a scarlet letter. The title of the film was apparently chosen because \"Madame\u00a0Bovary\" has the same connotations to Western audiences that \"Pan Jinlian\" does to Chinese audiences. \"I Am Not Madame\u00a0Bovary,\" though, is not about infidelity or the lowly position of women. The real story is about the nature of bureaucracy, and one woman's tireless attempt to go up against The System. This makes the film sound weighty and political, but \"I Am Madame\u00a0Bovary\" plays out as a comedy, a lampoon of the incompetence and laziness of government officials. Advertisement The first scene shows peasant woman Li Xuelian (Fan) visiting her cousin\u2014who knows about legal matters\u2014to ask him what recourse she has in terms of getting a divorce. Her story, rattled off to him, is incredibly complicated, and he looks more and more confused: she and her husband, trying to game the system, faked a divorce, complete with phony divorce papers, so that one of them would be eligible for the apartment they both wanted. The plan was that they would reunite eventually when Li Xuelian got pregnant and then they both could live in that apartment. The husband broke the rules of their plan, however: he fell in love with someone else during this time (treating his \"fake\" divorce as real, in other words), and he and his new \"wife\" moved into the cherished apartment, leaving Li Xuelian out in the cold. Her cousin suggests she present her case to the local court, which she does. They don't get it. (I don't blame them.) She is not put off easily. Her husband has put her in a horrible position and she needs to clear her name. She is no \"Pan Jinlian.\" And so begins her legal journey, as she sues each person who refuses to help her, eventually suing people all the way up to Beijing. She is a royal pain to the various county chiefs and judges and mayors: she races out in front of their cars shouting \"Stop!\", she holds up a sign and sits in the street outside of their offices. She appears at their conferences in Beijing like clockwork. They dread seeing her.\u00a0 The State, as shown in \"I Am Not Madame\u00a0Bovary,\" is not quite as oppressive as Airstrip One in 1984, but it is still a gigantic monolith. The film is crowded with obsequious toadying officials, mediocre bored bureaucrats, and ambitious nobodies covering their asses. They are all men, of course. Despite their power and status, each one eventually throws up his hands in helplessness at her relentlessness. Her behavior doesn't quite equal the absurdities of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the court case spanning generations in Dickens' Bleak House, but it does have a similar almost existential quality. Why won't they just give her what she wants so that they will leave her alone?\u00a0 \"I Am Not Madame\u00a0Bovary\" clocks in at almost two and a half hours, a pretty brutal length for a story so repetitive. Li Xuelian barely has a life outside of her quest. Everything she does is because she wants to clear her name. She has a strange romance with a childhood friend who has pined for her for years, but even within that, she has one goal and one goal only. It's the principle of the thing to her.\u00a0 Feng Xiaogang has chosen a distancing device for his visuals. The rural sections of the film are seen through a circular shape, cutting off the periphery of the screen, giving the impression that we are observing the action through a telescope. Or a rifle-sight. When she gets to Beijing, the circular shape vanishes, and suddenly the frame is a perfect square, representing the much larger world she enters. The circular shape limits the amount of movement possible on the screen, and group scenes in particular suffer because of that. There's a stilted quality to the interactions, and everyone stands in one spot like statues. The intention is to create the effect of an old Chinese painting, the ones seen in the opening of the film underneath the voiceover. This style must have required extreme rigor on the part of everyone involved to keep the action contained enough to stay inside that circle. Much of the film is stunning. These are moments in miniature, seen through a peephole. The color scheme is careful and poetic: watery greens and greys and blurring pinks in the countryside, while Beijing is all gold and red and white. Since much of the film involves Li Xuelian going back and forth from city to country (accompanied by a thrilling percussive score by Wei Du), there is a constant circle-to-square-scene change-up for the action. Feng's style excludes close-ups almost exclusively; the strict framing does not permit it. The overall effect is so distancing that it's as though the characters are at the bottom of a well.\u00a0 There's not an uninteresting or boring shot in \"I Am Not Madame\u00a0Bovary.\" It's a pleasure to look at the screen and to watch the artistry of the entire creative team. But there's a forbidding quality to the entire enterprise. That circular frame is way too small to squeeze through. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Tale of The Princess Kaguya", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Now nearly 80 years old, the Japanese animation director\r\nIsao Takahata has ever forged his own path over the course a half-century of\r\nwork. A legendary perfectionist, the co-founder of Studio Ghibli (also the home\r\nof the great Hayao Miyazaki) has broken molds by, for example, creating an\r\nanimated feature completely lacking in any \u201cfantastic\u201d element, the tender 1991\r\n\u201cOnly Yesterday.\u201d His new film, his first in 14 years, is a staggering\r\nmasterpiece of animation based on a very old Japanese folk tale. \u201cThe Tale of The Princess Kaguya\u201d is both very simple and head-spinningly confounding, a thing\r\nof endless visual beauty that seems to partake in a kind of pictorial\r\nminimalism but finds staggering possibilities for beautiful variation within\r\nits ineluctable modality. It\u2019s a true work of art.  Advertisement The movie begins with a gruff bamboo cutter in a forest. The\r\ncolors are pastel and watercolor; the drawing resembles charcoal sketches.\r\nCutting away at bamboo, the farmer sees a shaft of light; then a plant yields a\r\ndoll-like creature that, once he spirits it off to his cabin to show his wife,\r\ntransforms into a human baby. Despite being in middle age, the wife discovers\r\nshe can feed the baby (the breastfeeding depictions are very matter-of-fact);\r\nthe little girl is growing at an accelerated rate. She soon starts playing with\r\nsome of the males who live in the neighboring area; they nickname her \u201cL\u2019il\r\nBamboo.\u201d The leader of the boys is the slightly older Sutemaru, and all seems\r\nright for L\u2019il Bamboo in the pastoral paradise where she runs and plays and\r\nlaughs and sings a song about the nature of all living beings, a song she can\u2019t\r\nremember having learned but which she\u2019s always known.  Her adoptive pop has other ideas, especially after \u201cthe\r\ngods,\u201d as he believes, bestow a lot of gold upon him; he goes and buys a castle\r\nin the capital, and venture to make the little girl into a genuine princess.\r\nL\u2019il Bamboo\u2019s heart breaks, but she wants to honor her father\u2019s wishes. Here\u2019s\r\nwhere the movie\u2019s story takes a rather infuriating turn. As the girl, soon\r\ngiven the name \u201cKaguya,\u201d is trained and then visited by a quintet of ostensibly\r\nnoble suitors, the story turns into a kind of nightmare of patriarchy. Kaguya,\r\nbright and talented and beautiful, suffers through multiple squelchings of her\r\nown desire, and then acquiesces to the venal wishes of the authority figures\r\nshe loves. The movie is so emotionally roiling because it, too, is of two\r\nminds. It wants Kaguya\u2019s unfettered spirit to have its way, but it also\r\nrecognizes the almost primordial obligation that binds us to family and\r\nconvention. Kaguya\u2019s got her oafish father\u2019s number, and when she stands up to\r\nhim it\u2019s thrilling: \u201cIf I see you in a courtier\u2019s cap I\u2019ll kill myself,\u201d she\r\ntells him calmly at one point. And the father\u2019s ignorance is startling: he\r\ntruly believes that what he\u2019s putting Kaguya through is for her own happiness,\r\nthat this status is something she covets as much as he. Things take an even\r\nmore jarring turn once Kaguya finds out just where she\u2019s from.  Even if you have trouble hooking into the scenario\u2019s\r\ncultural idiosyncrasies\u2014the concerns of this movie, while not \u201cJapanese\u201d in and\r\nof themselves, are addressed in a very specifically Japanese way\u2014every frame of\r\n\u201cPrincess Kaguya\u201d is astonishingly beautiful. What looks rather rudimentary at\r\nthe film\u2019s opening is revealed to have a depth that never stops yielding\r\nbeauty; check out the shadows that fall over the bamboo cutter as he runs from\r\nthe forest with his discovery cradled in his arms. The movement animation of\r\nthe baby \u201cL\u2019il Bamboo\u201d is some of the best depiction of infant development ever\r\nin any medium: so much study, care, and artistry. Creatures both found in\r\nnature (insects, birds) and not (storm clouds that become dragons) are drawn\r\nwith remarkable sensitivity.  I believe the movie is best experienced with its original\r\nJapanese-language soundtrack; its widest release, however, will be in an\r\nEnglish-language dub featuring James Caan voicing the bamboo-cutter, Mary\r\nSteenburgen as the wife, and Chloe Grace Moretz as Kaguya. Due to a screening\r\nsnafu I was able to experience about fifteen minutes of this version and can\r\nreport that it sounds as if these performers honor the material well, so either\r\nway, don\u2019t miss this if you are an animation fan.

{"Title": "Buster's Mal Heart", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The 21st century has not yet produced a whole lot of noteworthy \u201cwhat is reality?\u201d movies, perhaps because we\u2019re too busy wondering \u201cwhat is reality?\u201d in real life to be potentially entertained by a fictional iteration of the question. Or maybe it\u2019s just because David Lynch hasn\u2019t made a feature film in over a decade.  It\u2019s a shame that this movie has a title that sounds like the filmmaker\u2019s dare to any indie distributor\u2019s marketing department, because \u201cBuster\u2019s Mal Heart\u201d is a genuinely noteworthy picture that deserves an audience. Written and directed by Sarah Adina Smith, it\u2019s a movie that puts the viewer into a bad dream, and is very canny in dispensing the keys to unlock the meanings of that dream\u2014and in strategically withholding some of those keys. Advertisement The movie begins with images of a man, the actor Rami Malek (whose popular television show \u201cMr. Robot\u201d might usefully acclimate some viewers to the mind-bending properties of this work) running through a darkening forest. Before we can establish why he\u2019s fleeing, Malek is seen with a long beard and long hair, stealthily breaking into a cozy mountain home while media reports on the soundtrack tell of a \u201chermit\u201d \u201cmountain man\u201d named Buster, a mysterious breaking-and-entering figure who, the announcers insist, is of no genuine threat to the populace at large. And then some scenes depict Malek again, once-more clean shaven, as a married father with professional and personal challenges. He works as a \u201cconcierge\u201d at a corporatized motel, he\u2019s obligated to take on the night shift, he\u2019s thus separated from his wife and daughter, which is on the other hand not too terrible because they\u2019re poor and have to live with his awful moralizing busybody mother-in-law. Sounds stressful, right? It is. The role gives Malek ample opportunity to perform the silent, wide-eyed panic at which he\u2019s practically a virtuoso.  In small dribbles, details of this banal Midwest hand-to-mouth existence emerge. Jonah (for this is the concierge\u2019s name) is married to Marty (Kate Lyn Sheil in a disciplined, enigmatic turn), a former drug addict who\u2019s found God and a church. Jonah himself seems to have less certainty in his philosophy of life. This makes him unusually susceptible to the theories of Brown, who\u2019s played by DJ Qualls with a chilled, spooky quality. Brown shows up at the hotel late one night, without ID or a credit card; he blatantly snorts cocaine in front of Jonah, who tries to throw him out but instead winds up pouring him some drinks from the long-closed bar. \u201cThe better the system, the more of a trap it is for the individual,\u201d Brown avers to Jonah, in the process of spinning out an elaborate prediction of a cataclysmic event called \u201cThe Inversion.\u201d This is tied into Y2K speculation (the film seems to be set in 1999), and also to theories Jonah has been getting from a weird local television program, proposing an interstellar physics that goes \u201cfrom black holes to buttholes.\u201d All this might lead one to believe that Jonah is head for a psychotic break, and that the movie\u2019s intercutting between Jonah and \u201cBuster\u201d are temporal shifts between past and present, depicting one character. Only that\u2019s not where this vision is heading.  Writer/director Smith pulls off her difficult vision with exemplary flair; this is a very accomplished second feature. It\u2019s not without glitches\u2014a scene in which Buster evacuates into a saucepan while a Spanish-language version of the reggae classic \u201cRivers of Babylon\u201d plays on the soundtrack was a little too gross-twee for my tastes\u2014but where it counts, as in a scene in which Buster makes dinner for an older couple that he\u2019s taken hostage in their own home, she imbues her scenes with both conventional suspense and an underlying discomfort that feels like a bad psychic rash. \u201cBuster\u2019s Mal Heart\u201d builds to a conclusion that\u2019s both head-scratching and a little heartbreaking, two qualities that are hard enough to pull off by themselves, let alone simultaneously.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Remember", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Atom Egoyan's revenge thriller \"Remember\" has such a compelling premise and an accomplished cast that it's a shame it doesn't add up to more. Christopher Plummer, still imposing at 86, plays Zev Guttman, a concentration camp survivor who lost his family in World War II to a sadistic Blockf\u00fchrer known as Kurlander, and is now living in a retirement home in New York City. Spurred on by his more frail friend Max (Martin Landau), who informs Zev that the guard is still around and living under an assumed name, he sets off in search of the elusive Kurlander, determined to avenge the great trauma of his life.  Advertisement There are a number of problems with the hero's quest, though, aside from the obvious question of whether two wrongs can make a right. For one thing, Zev is a grieving, at times almost emotionally catatonic-seeming widower who's suffering from what appears to be Alzheimer's (although Egoyan's script never quite comes out and tells us what his issue is medically\u2014it's a King Lear-like \"affliction\"). For another, neither Zev nor the viewers know for certain if Kurlander is really alive or if this tidbit is something dreamed up by Max, who's played by a Landau as an accusing specter who appears to be compensating for his own obvious decline and fear of death by offloading his issues on his a physically capable friend (Max's loved ones were killed by the same guard at Auschwitz). Finally, Max's information is incomplete: we're told that there is a Kurlander, but nobody knows if it's the Kurlander. Which means Guttman is in the position of becoming a mentally-addled human version of the title character in the first \"Terminator\" film: an assassin that set about killing every Sarah Connor in Los Angeles to make sure he eventually got the right one. From such early classics as \"Speaking Parts\" and \"The Adjuster\" through his 1997 masterpiece \"The Sweet Hereafter\" and more obviously pulpy projects like \"Where the Truth Lies\" and \"Devil's Knot,\" Egoyan has always been fascinated by the psychic weight of accumulated time, the elusiveness of justice, and the unreliability of memory. He often fractures his movies into narrative mosaics, flashing back and forth through time and into and out of subjective mental states, so that past and present seem to be occurring on top of each other and we don't always know what we're looking at or what it means. He keeps the structural gamesmanship to a minimum in \"Remember,\" embodying most of the story's instability in Plummer's performance. Is this the right strategy for a tale of pain, revenge and elusive truth, though? Perhaps not. The movie is not pulpy or emotional enough to work as a character study, nor clever and mysterious enough to succeed as a formal puzzle or a grand statement.  Plummer is a focused and detail-oriented actor, and he seems to be giving the movie what it wants: a numbed, aloof, recessive performance that we can project our assumptions and anxieties onto. But considering the emotional power of what Guttman has been through, there are moments when we want more from the character and the film. Egoyan's refusal to give them to us feels like a default art film strategy, mean to make us think there's a lot of nuance and complexity in what is ultimately the story of a probably-demented old man who was implanted with dark thoughts and is now wandering about with murderous intent because he can't figure out what else to do with himself.  Advertisement There's a terrific black comedy buried somewhere in this movie's morose, golden-hued moodiness, but neither the filmmaker nor his cast seem to have much interest in teasing it out. Instead what we get is sincere but glum and evasive, and a bit thin overall. Whether Guttman is bonding with a cute little boy on the train, buying a gun from a pawnshop owner who seems curiously uninterested in Zev's mental frailty and lack of firearms training, looking on as a security guard who's discovered the gun during a routine search compliments his choice of weapon rather than arresting him, or engaging in an unnerving verbal dance with the son of a possible Kurlander (Dean Norris of \"Breaking Bad\"), \"Remember\" doesn't give us much to latch onto.  In time, the Slipperiness of Truth routine starts to feel less like a statement than an abdication of a storyteller's basic responsibilities to the audience, as well as evidence of the film trying to distance itself from any possibility of turning into a Holocaust-themed elder care version of \"Death Wish\"\u2014a lurid notion that might've at least had a disreputable kick. Egoyan has a long history of delivering socko endings that retroactively make the entire story seem to snap into place and add up to more than the sum of its parts, and this movie is no exception.

{"Title": "This Beautiful Fantastic", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Bella Brown (\"Downton Abbey'\"s Jessica Brown Findlay), the central character of writer/director Simon Aboud's \"This Beautiful Fantastic,\" began life as a foundling, left in a box by a river as a baby, hovered over by protective ducks. Raised by nuns, Bella grows up to be a librarian, who harbors dreams of writing a children's book. She also has what appears to be OCD tendencies, but it's twee-movie OCD, an adorable character quirk more than anything else. She's a neat-nik. She is picky about what she eats. Her kitchen cabinets are organized with \"Sleeping With the Enemy\" precision. However, her organizational skills fail her in a couple of areas. She is constantly late to her job at the library, and she has also let the garden behind her rented house fall to ruin. In another movie, this all would seem stressful and dark, but \"This Beautiful Fantastic\" is not meant to be realistic. It's supposed to be a fairy tale. That's fine, but it's a very low-stakes fairy tale, wrapped in a strained garden metaphor. Advertisement \"This Beautiful Fantastic\" has a very small cast, and each male character circles around Bella, wanting only to help her, be near her. Some of these men appear to have nothing else to do in their lives but look out for her, get her out of scrapes, teach her how to live, blossom, grow. The film takes place in a somewhat period-less atmosphere, so it's unclear why she dresses like she's a suffragette in 1912, or a governess in the Edwardian era. Just another one of Bella's quirks, I guess. Her next-door neighbor Alfie (Tom Wilkinson) is an ogre, a semi-terrifying Scrooge, growling at her from over the fence. He's the one who calls the authorities to report the jungle of weeds that is her backyard. Bella is given a month to turn that jungle into a proper garden or she will be thrown out into the streets. Alfie's personal cook, a charming Irishman named Vernon (Andrew Scott), jumps ship from the mean old man to cook for Bella, even though she has no money to pay him. He's a father of two. Why would he give up a paying job for a non-paying one? You're not supposed to ask questions like this, but they were unavoidable. Vernon wanders around, carrying serving trays of food, giving Bella pep talks. He commandeers her kitchen. (Bella is constantly being over-ridden by everyone she meets, told what to do, where to go, who to be. She doesn't appear to mind.) At the library, Bella is drawn to a patron, a befuddled and adorable inventor named Billy (Jeremy Irvine). They bond over books, he shows her a mechanical bird he created. Bella says of him later, \"He invents mechanical animals and he makes me feel like I can fly.\"\u00a0 This kind of thing was done more effectively in \"Amelie\" (the film's clearest influence), or \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" another love story taking place in a timeless technology-less universe. The adorable heroine who inspires everyone she meets to do better, be better, who inspires a feeling of love and protectiveness in even crotchety old men, is as old as the hills (although usually it's a child\u2014like Anne Shirley, or Shirley Temple\u2014who melts the hearts of entire communities, not a grown woman.) Bella, except for her attention-getting outfits, doesn't register as that kind of character at all. Yes, she piles her peas into the corner of her plate, she needs a lot of help to do everything (garden, cook, get to work on time), she checks the lock 20 times before she leaves the house, but that doesn't make her seem remotely like a real person. (It's also hard to picture her writing anything that would be of interest to anyone.) The threatened eviction is an obvious device used to heighten the time crunch, and the garden metaphor wears out its welcome almost immediately. Fairy tales don't need to be realistic. There is charm and humor in all of the performances. But if you keep thinking, as I did, \"Wait, doesn't Vernon have two daughters he needs to support? How is he making a living?\" or \"Can't she just hire a gardener for two days to hack the weeds away?\" or \"Why is everyone in this film devoting their whole lives to making Bella blossom like those seeds she plants?\" then clearly something is not working.

{"Title": "Man Down", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "PTSD is a real, national crisis. It is something that is not openly discussed enough nor adequately handled by our government and those in charge of taking care of our veterans. The number of homeless vets and those suffering from PTSD in silence should be a priority for a country that wants to call itself civilized. None of these facts make Dito Montiel\u2019s \u201cMan Down\u201d a good film. Actually, the fact that it uses PTSD as a hook, as something to give its drama a sense of weight and importance that it doesn\u2019t otherwise earn, is one of its many problems. If you\u2019re going to make a film about PTSD, treat it with the respect it demands, not as a clich\u00e9d, melodramatic device. By doing so, one actually damages the cause they claim to be attempting to defend, turning something serious into something manipulative. \u201cMan Down\u201d is a bad film, but it\u2019s made even worse by the taste it will leave in your mouth regarding its silly handling of a very serious issue. Advertisement Montiel's latest takes place in what appears to be four separate periods in the life of Marine Gabriel Drummer (Shia LaBeouf). We see him with his buddy Devin (Jai Courtney) in a post-apocalyptic future, as the pair tries to track down Gabriel\u2019s son Johnathan (Charlie Shotwell), crossing paths with a drifter named Charles (Clifton Collins Jr.), who may know where the boy has been taken. The landscape they cross is desolate and empty. Where are they? What happened to Johnathan? What happened to everyone else? It's purposefully vague and confusing. We flash back to basic training, featuring scenes so dense with military clich\u00e9s they should have all been set to \u201cFortunate Son.\u201d Working slightly better as drama, we experience an extended conversation between Gabriel and a superior, played by Gary Oldman, that seems to take place after the young man has become a Marine but before the world ends. This scene as a whole is far and away the film's best as it escapes the plot and allows the two actors some semblance of character. Without it, the movie would verge on unbearable. And then we flash back further to Gabriel\u2019s life just before joining up, in which we meet his wife Natalie (Kate Mara) and enrich the bond between Gabriel and his son. The haphazard, choppy editing of \u201cMan Down\u201d is designed in such a way to replicate the confusion and twisted reality associated with PTSD, but its effect is opposite in that it feels entirely like cheap, manipulative devices instead of anything insightful about the human condition. \u201cMan Down\u201d is one of those scripts that plays games with viewer awareness, forcing us to ask what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not, and keeping a mystery what happened to Gabriel\u2019s son or while he was serving our country. Consequently, there are no real people in \u201cMan Down.\u201d There are no characters. There are merely cogs in the plot device machine.  Advertisement The sad thing is that LaBeouf does admirable work to try to correct for the lack of depth in Adam G. Simon and Montiel\u2019s script. He commits to the role completely, never betraying the film\u2019s shallowness or clich\u00e9s, and trying his best to find something worthwhile in terms of character. He makes some decisions in the extended scene with Oldman that totally work. He looks like a broken man, cracking from the inside out. There\u2019s a good LaBeouf performance buried deep in this film, and it almost makes the clich\u00e9s around it more frustrating because of the honest work they smother. Montiel has proven himself an interesting filmmaker when it comes to analyzing the alpha male in films like \u201cA Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\u201d and \u201cFighting,\u201d but he never figures out the right approach for \"Man Down.\" At times, the dialogue is so clich\u00e9d\u2014\u201cThis area\u2019s secure.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re at war, Marine. Nothing\u2019s secure.\u201d\u2014that it approaches parody, and I wondered if that wasn\u2019t intentional. There\u2019s a flashback in which the Marine buys his kid a puppy; the basic training scenes could have been written by a teenager who\u2019s seen too many military movies. And so on. Sadly, it\u2019s more likely just an example of people trying to handle a delicate, complex subject, but falling back on the devices instead of really tackling the material. Clich\u00e9s are easy. Manipulating audiences is easy. Really addressing a national crisis takes the kind of guts that \u201cMan Down\u201d just doesn\u2019t have.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "A Fantastic Fear of Everything", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Jack (Simon Pegg) is a writer. Or, he was. He wrote a popular children's\r\n book about a sensitive hedgehog named Harold. He blames that book for \r\nruining his marriage. When \"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" opens, Jack \r\nis currently working on a project called \"Decades of Death\", a study of \r\nVictorian-era serial killers, the \"Golden Age of murder\". He cannot \r\nleave his flat in Hackney. He sleeps clutching a knife. Jack is afraid \r\nof everything, of being murdered, of launderettes, of eyeballs, of \r\nChristmas carolers, of the telephone ringing, and every other casual \r\nthing that comes up in life.\n\r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\", directed by Crispian Mills (with \r\nanimation sequences directed by Chris Hopewell), is a fascinating and \r\nuneven horror-comedy, strange and ambitious, anchored by a tour de force\r\n performance by Simon Pegg. Pegg, obviously, is well-known to fans of \r\nEdgar Wright's films, as well as his appearances in blockbuster \r\nfranchises like \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Star Trek\", but here, he is \r\nbasically given a one-man show. He is in every scene, clad in filthy \r\nunderpants and an open silk robe. He is a phenomenal physical actor. \r\nWatching him work is the primary pleasure of \"A Fantastic Fear of \r\nEverything.\" Similar to \"Barton Fink,\" another hallucinogenic story of a\r\n writer haunted by his own unfinished projects and lost opportunities, \r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" examines the creative process as seen \r\nthrough the eyes of a writer gone completely mad.\n\r\nJack is a wreck when the film opens, and his condition deteriorates from\r\n there. Fleeing from shadows in his own gloomy flat, it is hard to \r\nbelieve that Jack was ever together enough to have had any success as a \r\nwriter, let alone be someone's husband. \"A Fantastic Fear\" is best when \r\nit explores what it is like inside a paranoid mind, a man so bewildered \r\nby the simple tasks of life (\"I've never bought a toilet roll!\" he cries\r\n in a panic to his agent) that he cannot leave his house.\n\r\nThe first half of the film features Jack gearing up for a lunch with his\r\n agent (deliciously played by Clare Higgins), and then the fallout from \r\nthat meeting, where she tells him a producer from Hollywood is \r\ninterested in his \"Decades of Death\" project. All he needs to do, the \r\nonly thing, is put on a suit and meet the guy for dinner. But once he is\r\n back in his flat, the hallucinations take over again, and he becomes \r\nconvinced that the Hollywood guy is somehow related to one of the grisly\r\n Victorian murderers on his wall. At any rate, the situation goes south,\r\n and his panic is exacerbated by the fact that he does not own a suit, \r\nhis socks are filthy, and he is afraid of going to the laundromat. Mills\r\n and the production design team pull out all the stops in the first \r\nhalf, filming Pegg in a distorted and fantastical way, so that never \r\nonce are we outside his delusional viewpoint. Shadows loom around Jack \r\nand cloaked figures seem to float at the end of the dark hallway. Six \r\ninnocent Christmas carolers on the stoop are filmed as though they are \r\nportents of evil doom. As awful as the situation is for Jack, Pegg is so\r\n funny and so committed to the performance that the psychotic break \r\nbecomes hugely entertaining.\n\r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" goes off the rails in its second half, \r\nwhen Jack ventures out to wash his socks, shirt, and underpants at a \r\nlaundromat. He is so frightened that the fellow customers at the \r\nlaundromat stare at him with what seems to be hostile intent. The \r\nsituation, which starts out humorously (made even more so by the fact \r\nthat Jack has accidentally Super-glued his huge knife to his hand), \r\ndrags on so long it becomes actually interminable. It is as though once \r\nJack leaves his flat, so rich with psychodrama horror-movie potential, \r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" doesn't know what film it wants to be \r\nanymore. There are still some very funny moments, and the script is \r\noften hilarious. Only Simon Pegg could make the screamed comment \"This \r\nis a CELLAR\" funnier with every repetition.\n\r\nAs the film galumphs awkwardly towards its ending, with flashes of \r\nvisual brilliance like intermittent lightning, events start to dovetail,\r\n and there are scenes with a Freudian psychiatrist (wearing an eyepatch \r\nand a pirate's hat), and a pretty girl who shows up at the laundromat \r\n(Amara Karan, well-known for her performance as Rita, or \"Sweet Lime\", \r\nin Wes Anderson's \"The Darjeeling Limited\"), as well as an actual serial killer on the loose who just wants to be loved because \r\nhe was abandoned as a child. The film is too cynical to play any of this\r\n sentimentally: the \"wounded inner child\" sub-plot is obviously supposed\r\n to be snarky and ironic, and it is. But the film is haunted by its \r\nsuperior first half.\n\r\n\"A Fantastic Fear of Everything\" is not, actually, fantastic, but it was\r\n inventive enough to hold my interest, weird enough to be intriguing, \r\nand bold in some of its visual experiments. At the center of it all is \r\nSimon Pegg; terrified and manic, talking to himself, racing around in \r\nstained Fruit of the Looms, kitchen knife glued to his hand. It is a \r\ncompelling and comedic portrait of creativity, obsession, and psychosis. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Young Ones", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "I don\u2019t want to come off like some kind of inverse snob, but\r\nI\u2019ve got to say, given the circumstances of his birth and upbringing,\r\nwriter-director Jake Paltrow strikes me as the Least Qualified Person To\r\nEnvision A Dystopian Sci-Fi Future Ever. You may infer the circumstances of\r\nPaltrow\u2019s birth and upbringing by his name, I reckon. In any event,\r\nqualifications notwithstanding, he has nevertheless opted to imagine and film\r\nsuch a story, one that bears out my hunch.  \u201cYoung Ones\u201d (there really isn\u2019t anything in the movie that\r\nmakes this bland title pop) takes place in an unnamed portion of the Western\r\nUnited States at a time when water is very scarce, and chronicles a sort of\r\nland-war-by-subterfuge in which the main players are Michael Shannon\u2019s haunted\r\npatriarch, Nicholas Hoult\u2019s ambitious young-man-on-the-make (for several items,\r\nincluding Elle Fanning\u2019s character, Shannon\u2019s daughter) and Kodi Smit-McPhee\u2019s\r\nobservant, sensitive son-of-Shannon. In Paltrow\u2019s future, water is a commodity\r\nnot unlike oil. But the former farmers of the now-desert in which Shannon\r\nroams, first with a live donkey, then with a robot replacement, are not nearly\r\nas stressed as ordinary mortals in danger of imminent dehydration might be in\r\nthe real world. Indeed, Paltrow\u2019s near-dystopia (there is still a central\r\ngovernment and a semblance of civilization, including used-car dealerships, in this\r\nworld) is one of the most decorous you\u2019ll ever see. Even the most thirsty and\r\ndesperate look pretty good most of the time. And the color coordination! At one\r\npoint, Aimee Mullins, playing a mom with a new robotic spinal cord, tunes into a\r\nvideo-streaming funeral, at which the attendees are all dressed in blue-grey\r\nclothes, the better to blend in with the blue-grey rock formation behind them.\r\nSeriously, this movie makes \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d look like \u201cThe Road Warrior.\u201d  Advertisement Paltrow, whose previous directorial feature was the somewhat\r\nmore apt 2007 showbiz romcom \u201cThe Good Night,\u201d is an attentive student of\r\ncinema, as his mini-homages to the likes of Antonioni and Lucas in this story\r\ntestify. But his story is a veritable nothingburger, here and there recalling notes\r\nfrom the likes of \u201cGiant\u201d and \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d but never really\r\nconnecting on levels emotional or intellectual. One would like to say the cast\r\ndoes its level best, but, to be brutally honest, the footage assembled doesn\u2019t\r\ndepict them doing a whole lot more than squinting, and looking lanky in clothes\r\nthat, again, aren\u2019t inordinately suitable for desert living, unless it\u2019s GQ\u2019s\r\nidea of desert living. Viewers who make it to the end will be confused or\r\ninfuriated but likely not delighted by the faux-Wes-Anderson curtain-call end\r\ncredits.

{"Title": "Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds stand side-by-side on a red carpet. The occasion is the third auction of the items in Reynolds' awe-inspiring collection of Hollywood memorabilia. A reporter asks, \"What is it that connects you two off the red carpet?\" Fisher answers, \"We are always on a red carpet. We have red carpets connecting our homes.\" That last part is an exaggeration, but only slightly. Fisher and Reynolds lived next door to one another for decades. They took their red carpet with them wherever they went. The blessing and curse of fame. This unique relationship is the subject of \u201cBright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,\" directed by Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens. It will be airing on HBO\u00a0on Saturday night. Advertisement The documentary premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, and then played at Telluride and the New York Film Festival, initially as a tender, human, and very, very funny portrait of Hollywood royalty. And then came the horrible news of Carrie Fisher's death at age 60 from a heart attack, and\u2014before anyone had a chance to take a breath\u2014the news of Reynolds' death at age 84. According to Todd Fisher, Carrie's brother, Reynolds said before dying that she \"wanted to be with Carrie.\" \"Bright Lights\" now makes its HBO premiere directly into the immediate shock waves of industry and fandom grief. \"Bright Lights\" opens with a montage of home movie footage: young Carrie and Todd Fisher in matching outfits, young Debbie Reynolds, with her husband Eddie Fisher (who, famously, left the family to marry Elizabeth Taylor), as Fisher and Reynolds have a conversation in voiceover. They bicker (Fisher: \"This is getting so ugly so fast\"), but in such a rapid-fire humorous way that it sounds like well-oiled schtick. It IS schtick, but it's not a retread of somebody else's tired routine. This routine is theirs, and theirs alone. Listening to it now is almost unbearably touching. There's a moment late in the film when Fisher and Reynolds, collapsed together on the couch, do a spoken-word version of \"There's No Business Like Show Business,\" making it sound like an impromptu conversation. It's an extraordinary scene (not to mention hilarious), and an encapsulation of the relationship, the way they picked up on each other's cues via extra-sensory sensitivity, setting each other up for punch lines gracefully, like the two old pros that they were. The documentary was shot mostly during 2014 and 2015, busy years for both women. (There's one extraordinary scene from 2010, when Fisher visits her father on his death bed.) Fisher was preparing to go film \"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,\" working out with a trainer as per LucasFilm's request, and Reynolds\u2014against her daughter's advice\u2014was still booking gigs in Las Vegas and elsewhere, despite the fact that she was feeling ill. Reynolds received the SAG Lifetime Achievement Award during this time, and there was also the third auction of her gigantic Hollywood memorabilia collection, which she attended with her children. Advertisement \"Bright Lights\" gets so much done that it's hard to believe it's only 95 minutes long. The documentary includes mini career retrospectives of both Reynolds and Fisher, with movie clips and commentary from both. There are interviews with both women, and they talk about their lives and careers but most of all, of course, they talk about each other. Fisher expresses worry about her mother's health, saying: \"Everything in me demands that my mother be as she always was. She just can't change. And she's fucking with me.\" These words now have a haunting echo. The devotion to preserving Reynolds' collection of Hollywood memorabilia (Dorothy's ruby slippers, Marilyn Monroe's \"subway-grate\" dress from \"The Seven Year Itch,\" to name a few) was a family activity, and all of them well up with tears of outrage and pain when they speak of the fact that nobody in the industry was interested in preserving the history Reynolds had collected, at least not interested enough to put up the money for a museum. Auctioning off those items was like cutting off a limb. At the last minute, Reynolds decides that she cannot part with the \"Rat Pack suits,\" saying, \"I love my ghosts. I love having memories. It's like having a friend forever.\" To those unaware of Reynolds' passion for collecting and preserving, \"Bright Lights\" serves as a beautiful reminder. There are echoes of \"Postcards from the Edge,\" (the book and screenplay written by Fisher) throughout, although with a softer, more forgiving edge. Fisher admits that she wrote the book at a very angry time in her life. Watching the elderly Debbie Reynolds, in her heavy-beaded gown, surrounded by helpers, walk up and down the stairs to the stage, was an image of show business professionalism that is a total inspiration. She was a woman who came up in a brutal studio system, who loved entertaining people, and was still\u00a0out there doing it, even though the crowds now were smaller and older. Despite her worries, Fisher understands why Reynolds needed to keep performing: \"Performing gives her life. It feeds her in a way family cannot.\" One of the most powerful impressions I got from Reynolds in \"Bright Lights\" was that her cheerfulness was not naivete, ignorance or shallowness. Her cheerfulness was a choice. Her cheerfulness shows how tough she was. Her cheerfulness helped her survive, in the same way that Fisher's humor helped her survive. Any time a celebrity dies and fans mourn publicly, the usual suspects show up to scold and mock (\"You didn't even know this person.\" \"In such a serious world, THIS is what you care about?\" etc.). Or, in a particularly egregious example, harass Steve Martin\u2014a man who knew and loved Carrie Fisher in real life\u2014for not expressing his Tweet-grief in a way that they thought appropriate. It was not anyone's finest hour. What these scolders don't understand is that celebrities\u2014or icons\u2014really matter\u00a0to their fans in ways intense and personal. In many cases, it is a personal loss. There's a moment in this film at a comics convention when a fan, getting Fisher's autograph, dissolves into tears right at the table. There's another moment when Reynolds comes out of the stage door after her show in Vegas, and a middle-aged male fan standing right there waiting for her, blurts out, \"I love you!\" Of course he does. Millions did. Love like that often represents the best part of us, because it's pure, and it comes from a place of gratitude, gratitude that these generous women have shared themselves with us, have given us so much. \"Bright Lights\" would have been entertaining even if both women had still been with us. But now, so sadly, it takes on whole other layers of meaning and impact. Tribute and mourning are often one and the same thing. They are within \"Bright Lights.\" Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Manglehorn", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "David Gordon Green continues to focus on character studies,\r\nas he did with \u201cPrince Avalanche\u201d and \u201cJoe,\u201d but the results this time are decidedly\r\nmore frustrating than those superior efforts. Just as \u201cJoe\u201d often felt like a vehicle\r\nto rehabilitate the oft-mocked career of Nicolas Cage in the last decade or so,\r\n\u201cManglehorn\u201d sometimes feels designed to remind us that Al Pacino is still one\r\nof our greatest actors. OK. Point taken. Now what? While \u201cJoe\u201d built an\r\ninteresting film around Cage\u2019s performance, Green leaves Pacino adrift in \u201cManglehorn,\u201d\r\nand the result is a disappointing, shambling piece of melancholy with a few\r\ninteresting scenes here and there that never cohere in such a way that allows the legendary actor to disappear into the character. Advertisement Pacino plays an eccentric locksmith named Manglehorn who lives in a small Texas town by himself. He\u2019s estranged from his financially successful son Jacob\r\n(Chris Messina), has few real friends outside of his cat, and writes letters to\r\nthe love of his life who got away many years ago. A highlight of his meager existence seems\r\nto be the occasional visit to the local bank to see the lovely teller Dawn\r\n(Holly Hunter), but when he\u2019s given a chance to turn that into something\r\ngreater, he fumbles. Manglehorn has allowed anger, regret and depression to push him into isolation in his later years. He doesn\u2019t have\r\nmuch left outside of his key-making business, and that basically just gives him\r\nanother reason to be alone in his shop.  On one level, Paul Logan\u2019s script is defiantly episodic:\r\nManglehorn talks to his son, he runs into an acquaintance (played in a\r\nremarkably aggravating style by Harmony Korine), he flirts with Holly Hunter,\r\netc. While \u201cManglehorn\u201d could have been a character study, a slice of reclusive\r\nold age in modern America, Logan and Green layer their film with poetic\r\nself-importance, mostly in Manglehorn\u2019s letters and inner monologues, complete\r\nwith lines like \u201cI\u2019m losing hope in tomorrow.\u201d\r\nIt feels false, like a degree of self-understanding that only comes in motion\r\npictures or bad fiction. And that dishonesty carries over to scenes between\r\nManglehorn and his son, especially a dinner between the two that\u2019s just too\r\npoorly written for Pacino and Messina to save it. Every shot of Manglehorn\u2019s grizzled face is weighted with\r\nunearned gravitas, the kind that comes with designing a film around an\r\nactor instead of a character or a narrative. It feels like the first draft was\r\ncalled \u201cAl Pacino is Still a Hell of an Actor.\u201d And that showcase is constantly\r\npushing against the film\u2019s realism. There\u2019s a scene late in the film between\r\nPacino and Hunter that really should work\u2014she\u2019s great in it\u2014in which Dawn\r\nrealizes that Manglehorn\u2019s enclosed life is one that she may not want to enter,\r\nbut Pacino and Green can\u2019t figure out how to play the moment. Pacino practically\r\nclimbs on a soapbox to deliver a monologue, when it should be about a man\r\nafraid and tentative to re-enter the real world of human relationships. At its best, \u201cManglehorn\u201d is a surprisingly deep conversation\r\nwith an old friend on a twilight Southern evening. It\u2019s about those times in\r\nour lives when we reassess past mistakes and consider the diminishing hours we\r\nhave left on this planet. I only wish the film allowed that conversation to\r\nflow naturally with a well-rounded character instead of reminding us over and over again that we\u2019re\r\ntalking to the one and only Al Pacino.

{"Title": "In Order of Disappearance", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The body count that Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's taciturn snowplow-operating Nils Dickman racks up in Hans Petter Moland's revenge-thriller-comedy \"In Order of Disappearance\" almost makes Dirty Harry look like a softie. Liam Neeson wreaking havoc around the world after his daughter is kidnapped yet again in the \"Taken\" franchise seems like a slacker in comparison. Nils is a gloomy civil servant just voted \"Citizen of the Year\" for his tireless devotion to keeping the roads clear. When his son turns up dead from an apparent drug overdose, he knows it was murder, and, in trying to track down who did the deed, unveils a web of international drug-runners operating out of the tiny nearby airport in the isolated snowy middle of nowhere. Nils sets out to kill whoever was responsible. He is as unstoppable as his snowplow. Advertisement As Nils discovers the scope of this thing, he works his way to the top, because whoever is at the top is the one who really needs to pay. Each person who dies gets their own little epitaph screen, operating like a cynical little chuckle as Nils checks the name off the list. Maybe the cynical chuckle is Moland's. It's a fun device the first three or four times it occurs, but the joke becomes increasingly rote as it goes on. The fun of the film (and it is often fun) is in the complexities of interconnections, and the sheer number of criminals raging through this tiny area, outnumbering the upstanding citizens by the looks of it. All of the secondary characters, the bumbling cops, the warring drug dealers, their families, their rivals, are all broad caricatures played by a very funny cast of character actors. Somebody\u00a0is killing them all off one by one and everyone points the finger at everyone else, never once suspecting that that hunched-over guy at the wheel of the snowplow is the murderous maniac responsible. The head honcho in the area is Greven (P\u00e5l Sverre Hagen). Greven is a flamboyant villain, a childish psychopath who also happens to be a ponytail-wearing militant vegan. He is sure that it's the Serbians doing the killings (he keeps referring to them as Albanians, and is enraged when corrected). Greven has his goons go after the Serbians, the Serbians retaliate, the epitaph credit-screens pile up. Some of the \"bits\" in the film are full-on farcical, and some have a wintry dry wit. Others feel improvisational, like Greven spluttering at his wife: \"You think you know me! But you don't fool me, with your fucking hipster mittens!\" Cinematographer Philip \u00d8gaard captures the white-out conditions of \"In Order of Disappearance\" in ways haunting and eerie. He has a good eye for the weird and specific: the gravestones jutting up out of the endless expanse of white, the blue-white snow at night with Nils' snowplow light cutting its way through the darkness, plumes of snow billowing off to the side. \"Fargo\" might come to mind, but this snowy wilderness is different, harsher. Nils wraps the dead bodies in chicken wire and dumps them over a roaring waterfall plunging into an icy river below. This is Skarsg\u00e5rd's third collaboration with Moland (\"Aberdeen,\" and \"A Somewhat Gentle Man\" being the other two), and he's really not given much to do. He's a blank-faced killing machine. Nils remains a completely undeveloped character, although character development is clearly not what Moland was after. Moland was after the humor concept of a bunch of drug lords fighting over who gets to deliver cocaine to a tiny patch of snow. It's as if Quentin Tarantino went to the Arctic Circle. The character of Nils certainly can't compete with the eccentric secondary characters, the Serbian goombahs snarling with rage over the battle of Kosovo (which went down in 1389) and Greven downing a vegan smoothie as he screams at his second-in-command. The killings are creative and brutal, but eventually, the whole structure of it, with the epitaphs announcing the deaths \"in order of disappearance\"\u2014becomes an empty and slick exercise in style.

Or, for\r\nthat matter, not being the movie of that description that you might want. The\r\ngreat based-on-a-true-story journalism movie of the last 65 or so years was, of\r\ncourse, \u201cAll The President\u2019s Men,\u201d chronicling the determined search for truth\r\nconducted by crusading reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The\r\nWashington Post. One of the distinguishing features of \u201cKill The Messenger\u201d is\r\nthat The Washington Post figures in the narrative as one of the bad guys.  Advertisement Directed by Michael Cuesta (\u201cL.I.E.,\u201d \u201cRookie,\u201d and, most\r\npertinently, episodes of\u00a0 \u201cHomeland\u201d)\r\nfrom a script by Peter Landesman (the writer/director of \u201cParkland,\u201d who\r\nhimself has a considerable background in investigative journalism), and\r\nstarring Jeremy Renner, who is also an executive producer, \u201cMessenger\u201d is about\r\nGary Webb, a feisty reporter for the San Jose-Mercury News who seems to be\r\nhaving a grand old time writing about drug dealers who are getting their houses\r\nillegally confiscated by the government. His wife (Rosemarie De Witt) tolerates\r\nthe haphazard lifestyle such an occupation brings, up to a point; when the\r\nhotsie-totsie girlfriend of an accused trafficker drops off a package of files at\r\nWebb\u2019s home, the missus alludes to some past trouble in the marriage. Turns out\r\nthe hotsie-totsie (amusingly incarnated by Paz Vega) is kind of using Webb as a\r\ncat\u2019s paw, but in so doing, she throws either the story of a lifetime, or a\r\nlive grenade, or both, into his lap: information pointing to a government\r\ninvolvement in the crack cocaine trade, a byzantine arrangement by which the\r\nC.I.A. was able to fund Ronald Reagan\u2019s Contras by either looking the other way\r\nat, or deliberately engineering, drug-money-for-arms transactions. Interviewing\r\na big-shot dealer in a Central American jail (Andy Garcia), that dealer recalls\r\na meeting with one \u201cOllie.\u201d \u201cOliver North?\u201d Webb asks, a little stunned. \u201cNo,\r\nOliver Hardy, \u201c the prisoner says. \u201cOF COURSE Oliver North.\u201d  Despite the warnings of a D.C. bureaucrat (Michael Sheen)\r\nwho suggests that characterizing the realm Webb is exploring as a \u201crabbit hole\u201d\r\nwould perhaps be an extremely dire understatement, Webb convinces his editors\r\nto run his story. Initially hailed as a hero, Webb is soon met with\r\noverwhelming skepticism. Papers such as The New York Times and The Washington\r\nPost, with \u201cwho is this upstart?\u201d indignation, start picking at aspects of the\r\nstory, and then at Webb himself. The trouble to which Webb\u2019s wife had alluded\r\nto returns to bite him and his family in the ass, hard. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make\r\nit about you,\u201d Sheen\u2019s character predicted. Boy, do they ever. The movie is, in\r\nits details, relatively discreet about laying blame but fairly definite in\r\ndepicting a media culture now so entrenched in the establishment that it\r\ndoesn\u2019t even have to be coerced into serving the interests of the powerful.\r\nThat the filmmakers are able to pursue their theme to the extent that the true\r\nstory on which the film is based obliges them to somehow has to be credited to\r\nRenner. His performance is very good, despite the somewhat stereotypical bro\r\ncharacteristics with which the Webb character is here endowed. Around the\r\nmid-point of the movie, I noted that the material was sufficiently compelling\r\nthat, say, the montage of Renner tooling around on a motorcycle being all\r\nstressed out was kind of beside the point. In light of the picture\u2019s finale,\r\nthat sort of thing made slightly more sense, but still carried an aura of\r\nspecial pleading.  That said, it\u2019s a minor quibble relative to the pretty\r\nsubstantial points the movie\u2019s making. The death of print and the death of\r\njournalism are two different phenomena, but they\u2019re not unrelated; if you\u2019re\r\nof the opinion that it\u2019s all because of the Internet, well, \u201cKill The\r\nMessenger\u201d has some perhaps disturbing news for you\u2014about the news you are now\r\ngetting, and the news you are now not getting.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Girl with All the Gifts", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In many ways, Melanie (Sennia Nanua) is just another ordinary girl. She goes to school every day, where she\u2019s grown affection for her teacher Ms. Justineau (Gemma Arterton). And she\u2019s at that age where she\u2019s figuring out what\u2019s important to her, and how to navigate through the world of adults around her. But Melanie is not an ordinary girl. She will soon be a mindless, soulless zombie, a braindead creature who responds only to a desire to kill and eat people around her. In fact, with the right triggers\u2014like if the adults around her forget to wear their scent-disguising lotion\u2014she could become that right now. Just when you thought the zombie genre was out of ideas, along comes Colm McCarthy\u2019s smart and engaging \u201cThe Girl with All the Gifts,\u201d a film with echoes of George A. Romero, Danny Boyle, and Robert Kirkman but one that also feels confidently its own creation, a unique take on responsibility, adulthood, and a new chapter in evolution. Advertisement Melanie isn\u2019t alone. She lives with a number of other zombie-children like her in a bunker beneath a military facility, where she\u2019s being studied and experimented on by Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close), in the hope that they could provide the antidote for what has essentially ended normal human existence. Melanie is one of several second-generation flesh-eaters called \u201chungries,\u201d babies who literally ate their way out of their parents but are not behaving in precisely the same way as the brain-dead speedsters that have destroyed humanity. Whenever a child is found in the wild, they\u2019re taken to this facility, where Dr. Caldwell can experiment on them and Sgt. Eddie Parks (Paddy Considine) can work to control them. Said control involves leg, arm and head restraints whenever the children are anywhere near that oh-so-enticing human flesh. But Melanie seems so normal and is clearly learning empathy. The good doctor sees that as well, and even starts to loosen some of the restraints keeping Melanie more of an object than a person. Then one day Dr. Caldwell comes for Melanie, ready to dissect her and see exactly what she can learn from this unique child the hard way. Before Dr. Justineau can save her, all hell breaks loose and the facility is overrun. A small group of survivors is forced to travel to another sanctuary city in the hope that it\u2019s still being run by people who don\u2019t eat flesh. Melanie goes with them, and proves to be pretty useful.  One of the major strengths of \u201cThe Girl with All the Gifts\u201d is evident early in McCarthy\u2019s tactile, believable world-building. Much as Romero paid close attention to such details, the set design, costumes, and the world of \u201cGifts\u201d feels lived-in and genuine. And it\u2019s a nature-based aesthetic (dirt on walls, costumes that look worn, etc.) that continues and even strengthens once this ragtag crew is forced from safety and into the dangerous world. There\u2019s a visceral, emotional impact to the horror and action of \u201cThe Girl with All the Gifts\u201d that resonates because the characters and the world they live in feels real to us. It\u2019s hard to overstate how important this to a horror movie, especially one set in a post-apocalyptic world. If we don\u2019t believe the world is genuine, we won\u2019t care what happens in it. Advertisement Of course, performance goes a long way to amplify this believability as well, and it\u2019s not often you see a horror film with a cast this strong. Close could have gone showy with her doctor with a heart of ice but she plays it straight, again conveying the believability of the moment more than the B-movie archetype this character could have become. Considine and Arterton perfectly convey authority and warmth, respectively, although they\u2019re good enough to make these people into more than mere plot devices. And Nanua is a find, again never giving her performance with a knowing wink. So she\u2019s a zombie child who could be the evolutionary key to the future\u2014this just happens to be her reality. The traveling band aspect of \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d the cities and landscapes empty of human existence of \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d the military aspect of \u201cDay of the Dead\u201d\u2014it\u2019s easy to pick apart the influences of \u201cThe Girl with All the Gifts.\u201d But just as Melanie marks something altogether new in this world\u2014a zombie with a conscience\u2014the film about her feels inspired by what came before but also good enough to inspire those that come after.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Film Critic", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "If we agree with famous Baltimore contrarian H.L. Mencken that a\u00a0critic\u00a0must, above all things, have a \"capacity for gusto,\" then Victor Tallez (Rafael Spregelburd), the Buenos Aires\u00a0film\u00a0critic\u00a0moping his way through Hern\u00e1n Guerschuny's \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is failing spectacularly in his calling. The \"capacity for gusto\" has been sucked out of him. He sees too many\u00a0films, and all of them are bad. He has lost touch with the unwashed hoi polloi, who adore clich\u00e9d rom-coms, who approach things with (as he sees it) an uncritical eye. He rolls his eyes at gusto. Tallez is a clich\u00e9 himself, the\u00a0critic\u00a0who scoffs at popular taste, who feels the entire world has derailed into a pit of sentimentality and bad art. \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" pokes fun at\u00a0criticism\u00a0(at least Tallez's cranky prissy brand of it), and while lampooning self-serious intellectual\u00a0critics\u00a0is akin to shooting fish in a barrel, \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" takes a light and knowing tone, spoofing the sacred cows of the\u00a0critic\u00a0world, and cramming every scene with visual\u00a0film\u00a0clich\u00e9s that act like a \"Where's Waldo?\" of cinema.\u00a0 Advertisement The opening of \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" shows the back of Tallez's head as he walks through the Buenos Aires streets, all as he drones on in French about his \"maladie du cinema.\" \"Films\u00a0are suffocating me,\" he states flatly, and the condition is incurable. Set against grainy black-and-white street-scene images, reminiscent of the French New Wave, Tallez comes across as a dissociated gloomy figure, trapped in the confines of his own head. At the end of the opening, he drones, again in French, \"At one point one may want to know why I think in French.\" [Beat.] \"I have no idea.\" Of course, an Argentinian\u00a0film\u00a0critic, who sees the world as a French New Wave\u00a0film, who is working on an \"exhaustive\" study of Godard, would \"think\" in French.\u00a0 Tallez is a nationally syndicated\u00a0film\u00a0critic, and seems glumly proud of the fact that he hasn't given a review \"Four Seats\" (his newspaper gives \"seats\" instead of \"stars\") in years. He spends his days in a monotonous manner, going to press screenings, then out for coffee with a group of\u00a0critics. Back at the office, his boss rails at Tallez, scolding him for his harsh reviews (\"You are a terrorist of taste\"). Tallez's harshest critiques go to rom-coms, and he lectures his credulous niece (Telma Crisanti), who loves rom-coms and can recite \"Jerry Maguire\" from memory, on what is wrong with the genre. Tallez describes the rom-com clich\u00e9s: \"Do not forget to put rain, lots of rain. And a run. We don't know why, but they always run.\" (Cue image of Billy Crystal running to find Meg Ryan in \"Harry Met Sally.\") Tallez is a drip.\u00a0 Of course, over the course of \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic,\" Tallez meets an adorable and carefree woman named Sofia (Dolores Fonzi), who challenges all of his hard-won contempt for rom-coms. Sofia breezes into his life, wearing a big furry beret, carrying her Pink Panther bike helmet under her arm, a Manic Pixie Dream Girl par extraordinaire. She has no job, she is \"quirky\" (one of her quirks is kleptomania), she takes Tallez to experimental performance art pieces (Tallez drones in French on the voiceover: \"My God. Enough. Kill me.\") and, strangely enough, she has nothing better to do with her time than to hang out with this crank and show him how beautiful life can be. In its own fluffy way, Sofia is a critique of the movie clich\u00e9: woman as inspirational figure sprinkling fairy-dust over gloomy self-absorbed men drawn into their magical circle. When they first kiss, fireworks go off in the sky. Tallez has entered the rom-com of his nightmares and finds that it's not actually all that bad.\u00a0 Advertisement Guerschuny (who wrote and directed) takes a self-conscious and self-aware approach. \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is loaded with references to other\u00a0films, and the style changes drastically as the various subplots kick into gear. When Sofia enters, suddenly the\u00a0film\u00a0becomes a rom-com, with cute music and montage sequences, where she tries on adorable hats at a street market. In a darker subplot, Tallez is stalked by a young director, furious about Tallez's review of his\u00a0film. The director sneers at Tallez, \"It took me 5 years to make it. It took you 5 minutes to destroy it.\" The director shows up everywhere, in crowd scenes, across streets, glaring through the space at Tallez, and as that rises in importance, the\u00a0film veers into a thriller, complete with dark empty movie theatres, and ominous tracking shots.\u00a0 The most interesting thing about \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is how it poses the possibility that there may be more truth in clich\u00e9s than Tallez perhaps wants to acknowledge. The reason mass audiences respond to rom-coms (for example) is that such\u00a0films\u00a0approach the truth of the matter of Love, even in their non-realistic, sometimes tiresome ways. Love is something universal, and who you fall in love with is a matter of the greatest importance to regular people who are not characters in a movie. Rom-coms acknowledge that sense of importance, and the urgency of those clich\u00e9d moments (running through the rain, or running through an airport to stop your beloved from getting on a plane to Antarctica, or whatever, everyone is running), express that urgency in a formula that often works. If it didn't work, it wouldn't be used so much. As embarrassing as it is to Tallez, he discovers that falling in love with someone actually does feel like fireworks going off over the bay.\u00a0 Hern\u00e1n Guerschuny is a longtime\u00a0film\u00a0critic\u00a0(he runs the magazine Haciendo Cine) and \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is his debut. Many of the details in \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" are spot-on: the conversations at press screenings (arguing about whether a\u00a0film\u00a0is good/bad enough for The Berlinale), people making statements about how they hate comedy because \"there's nothing to discuss\", the constant references to cinema, the casual comments made during conversation, like: \"In high school I spent more time following the career of some director of photography than getting a girl's phone number.\" Much of \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is an in-joke aimed at an insular sub-culture, and so it lacks a sense of significant commentary on its subject matter (think of \"In a Lonely Place,\" or \"Adaptation,\" or \"Barton Fink\" for comparison). \"The\u00a0Film\u00a0Critic\" is an extended spoof more than anything else (it may have worked better as a short\u00a0film), and its targets are pretty shallow, but it still includes many entertaining and insightful elements.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}

But it's still a bit of a shame that this movie doesn't have more to offer than one more go-round for a great character, a bigoted twit who has delusions of musical grandeur but knows deep down how limited he is.\u00a0 David, of course, is the creation of writer/director/actor Ricky Gervais, who memorably portrayed him on the original series and a follow-up TV movie and has continued to bring him back around occasionally since then, to make guest appearances on the American TV spinoff of \"The Office,\" on concert stages, and in the popular YouTube series \"Play Guitar with David Brent.\" This film, which premiered last year, doesn't have much to add beyond a few biographical details.\u00a0 Advertisement   David has somehow landed a sales job at Lavichem, a chemical company. Introductory glimpses of David in the presence of coworkers confirm that he has softened a tiny bit, more due to suffering a string of defeats than by conscious choice, and fights a mostly losing battle to avoid offending everyone in sight by blurting out every thought he has at the instant that he has it. There's inappropriate sexual innuendo galore, and David and a coworker do a \"Chinaman\" impression at one point; Gervais cuts periodically to bystanders marveling that such a pathetic person could exist, much less have a decent job that places him alongside adults who can function in reality without continually offending each other. Another coworker explains that Brent is \"like a kid ... he wants attention ... you see a man that age and you thinking, 'What are you doing?'\"\u00a0   The original \"The Office\" made an art of eating its cake and having it, too, pointedly criticizing David's ignorance and thoughtlessness while deriving a comic thrill from seeing how dreadful his remarks could get and how he could push his luck without self-destructing. \"Life on the Road\" offers no such thrills because David is so far down that he has nowhere to go but up, and there are many moments where the film seems determined to make us flat-out love the guy even though there's nothing lovable about him except his suffering, all of which is self-inflicted.\u00a0   David embarks on a self-financed tour with a hired-out band of musicians, performing \"Ooh La La\" and other chestnuts for audiences of half-interested, often aghast patrons, falling down onstage, and somehow wrangling a radio interview that fails to mention his gig that night. The film is quite repetitive, essentially a very long sketch, and offers little in the way of character development for supporting players. In contrast to the original \"The Office,\" everyone else is there mainly to stare in shock at David as he offends people or does something stupid. There's also the disquieting sense that the entire project exists so that people can get a nice, long opportunity to hear Gervais sing and think, \"Wow\u2014you know, this is a joke, but he's actually not bad.\"\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}

Well, sorta. Working from a book by Laura\r\nKasischke that one presumes lacks the melodrama other writers would have\r\nlayered into a story about the destruction of a teenage girl\u2019s family, Araki\r\ntreats his subject matter with a heady dose of apathy. Kat\u2019s mother, the\r\nflamboyant Eve (Eva Green), just up and disappears one day. Kat suspects that\r\nher boyfriend Phil (Shiloh Fernandez) may know more about the disappearance\r\nthan he lets on, and the cops, led by Detective Scieziesciez (Thomas Jane),\r\nsuspect dear old dad (Christopher Meloni), of course. But the \u201cmystery\u201d of Eve\u2019s\r\ndisappearance is never front and center in \u201cWhite Bird in a Blizzard.\u201d To be\r\nhonest, little is front and center. Kat meanders through the hazy days after\r\nher mom\u2019s disappearance, we get a few flashbacks and then the film jumps\r\nforward for a final chapter. And that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not suggesting that all films need a grand purpose, but \u201cWhite\r\nBird in a Blizzard\u201d doesn\u2019t work as mystery or character study. It\u2019s a melting\r\npot of themes that have not only been handled more interestingly in recent\r\nyears but have been handled more interestingly within its own director\u2019s\r\nfilmography\u2014murder, apathy, obsession, sex and intrigue in suburbia. Parts of\r\nit play broad like satire, as if Araki is doing a riff on \u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d\r\nbut too much of it sits there, almost as if Araki isn't excited by the material he's been given. Not all of it just \"sits there,\" however. As they often are, Araki\u2019s music\r\nchoices are clever, and I\u2019m happy to have lived long enough to have seen an\r\nextended dance scene to Depeche Mode\u2019s \u201cBehind the Wheel.\u201d And Woodley, as she\r\nso often does, grounds the film in something genuine. She has such a natural,\r\nin-the-moment presence that she keeps us interested in Kat\u2019s arc even when the storytelling\r\ndoesn\u2019t. And then there\u2019s Eva. Eva Green turns Eve into a character Joan\r\nCrawford would have told to tone it down. She is larger than life, desperate to\r\nbe the most important person in the room. And \u201cWhite Bird\u201d is at its most\r\ninteresting when Green is allowed to play the dark soul of a woman shattered by\r\nthe realization that her daughter was suddenly more interesting than she was.\r\nGreen is fantastic here, truly memorable in just a few scenes.

The star of some of the greatest films ever made\u2014never mind nation or genre, just GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE\u2014the man was an exacting, electrifying performer. In documenting and celebrating his life and his films, you\u2019d have to go very far wrong indeed to come out of the effort with something bad or uninteresting. Advertisement   That said, \u201cMifune: The Last Samurai,\u201d a documentary on the actor directed by Steven Okazaki and narrated by Keanu Reeves (the script is by Okazaki and Stuart Galbraith IV) got off on a somewhat bad foot for me. Explaining Mifune\u2019s place in the firmament of pop culture, the narration says of his collaborations with director Akira Kurosawa, \u201cwithout them there would have been no \u2018Magnificent Seven.\u2019\u201d This is factually true but seems to me to throw out a very crucial baby with the bathwater. What makes Kurosawa and Mifune crucial is that without them there would be no \u201cSeven Samurai.\u201d   But the fact of the matter is that I\u2019m not the \u201ckey demo\u201d for this movie. \u201cMifune: The Last Samurai\u201d wasn\u2019t made for fans like me. Although fans like me will likely be the first in line to see it. After explaining Mifune\u2019s importance, the movie lays out a brief history of Japanese cinema, the \u201cchanbara\u201d (swordplay) movie in particular. Only then does it get to Mifune\u2019s fascinating life: Born in 1920 to parents who set up business in China, he only sets foot in Japan at age 20, to fight in World War II. That experience was traumatic, but not in a conventional way. Harboring no ambitions to act, he tries to follow a bit in his photographer father\u2019s footsteps by apprenticing as a camera assistant at a film studio. His good looks, simultaneously rugged and smooth get him noticed, and so\u2026   What the movie is very good at revealing and expanding upon is how this reluctant actor became such a masterful one. In part it was due to his presence. \u201cHe\u2019s not an actor who blends into the background,\u201d one of his surviving colleagues notes. In part it was due to what his life experience taught him. His experience made him determined, one interviewee notes, to \u201cnever again be the kind of person who bends to authority.\u201d But it was also, eventually, his devotion and his research. His frequent costar and friend Yoshio Tsuchiya notes \u201cThe one word I would use to describe Mifune is \u2018perseverance\u2019!\u201d Advertisement   Mifune put himself through a lot. He was a heavy drinker whose alcohol abuse ended up affecting his family life. His oldest son nevertheless remembers his father\u2019s great \u201ccompassion.\u201d The movie concentrates mostly on Mifune\u2019s collaboration with Kurosawa, which yielded great pictures such as the groundbreaking \u201cRashomon,\u201d \u201cSamurai,\u201d \u201cThe Hidden Fortress,\u201d \u201cYojimbo,\u201d and \u201cRed Beard.\u201d While it does not dig deep on what ended their collaboration (Martin Scorsese, also known as a director with a compelling long-term relationship with a single actor, now dormant, offers some fascinating rumination on the subject), its account of a sort of long-distance reconciliation is very moving.   The movie\u2019s clips are thrilling, and apt. While I commend \u201cMifune: The Last Samurai\u201d for its briskness, and its occasional crowd-pleasing playfulness\u2014as when it introduces viewers to the actor who put on the rubber suit to play Godzilla the same year he was a samurai in Kurosawa\u2019s classic\u2014it\u2019s a movie I myself could have stood to see more of. Fascinating Mifune/Kurosawa collaborations such as \u201cStray Dog\u201d and \u201cThe Idiot\u201d are given short shrift if mentioned at all. When going into Mifune\u2019s international career, his role in \u201cHell In The Pacific,\u201d in which he goes one-on-one with another icon/legend, Lee Marvin, is given the briefest of mentions. Last I looked, that movie\u2019s director John Boorman is both alive and as voluble as ever. And so on. Again, these quibbles arise from the fact that this is a beginner\u2019s guide, not a fest for fans. Is it too much to expect an expanded DVD edition though?", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Michael Jackson's Journey from Motown to Off the Wall", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Michael may be the purest talent I've ever seen. He's incapable of a false moment.\" \u00a0- Director Sidney Lumet, on Michael Jackson in \"The Wiz.\" Michael Jackson, along with his almost otherworldly talent, was always one of the most emotional performers. In the pantheon with James Brown, Judy Garland, Jackie Wilson, and a handful of other electric live performers, Jackson's onstage persona and performing ability was akin to the Big Bang, there was no end to the expansion. People responded to him personally, and, because he started out so young, a generation grew up with him, identified with him, watched in awe at his transformations. Spike Lee's documentary \"Michael Jackson\u2019s Journey From Motown to Off the Wall,\" premiering on\u00a0February 5th\u00a0on Showtime, is as emotional as its subject matter. Kobe Bryant, interviewed in the documentary, says at one point, \"It's easy for people to get sidetracked. They talk about his complexion. They don't focus on what this man was, and how he was that.\" What with the tabloid frenzy of Michael Jackson's life, not to mention his early death, Lee's documentary is a welcome corrective as well as an almost aggressive act of redress and celebration. It does not get \"sidetracked.\" It's about Michael Jackson's work, and how he worked. Maybe most pleasingly, it's a track-by-track history lesson of Jackson's 1979 album \"Off the Wall,\" an album that still gets so much radio play today that if you didn't know better you might think it was released last weekend.  Advertisement The plot points of Jackson's early life (the rise of the Jackson 5 on Motown, their jump to Epic, Michael emerging as the solo star, culminating in Off the Wall) may be well-known to those who grew up in that era but Lee presents it in a way that passes the information on to a new generation. When there is an artist as big as Michael Jackson was, as important, as ... improbable, really (and it's more improbable the more you learn), it's essential that an understanding of the achievement of that art is passed on (especially to kids who may only know him as the weird man in sunglasses on the cover of every tabloid). A film like Lee's says: \"See what he did? See how much space he created for others? For you? Honor that.\"  Format-wise, the documentary is pretty standard: fun archival footage of concerts and cartoons and interviews, beautiful still photographs, and lots of interview subjects. Quincy Jones, Motown's Berry Gordy, Philadelphia soul producers Gamble and Huff, Ron Alexenburg at Epic, Marlon and Jackie Jackson, all provide background for the Motown years, the Epic years, for the explosion of the Jackson 5 as a worldwide phenomenon.  Counterpointed against the professional memories of Jackson's colleagues, are the voices of those inspired by Michael Jackson, including Lee himself. Lee Daniels (\"He's everything I aspired to be\"), David Byrne, Mark Ronson, Rosie Perez, John Leguizamo, Questlove, Misty Copeland, Kobe Bryant, Pharrell, John Legend ... all weigh in with memories of what he meant to them, how he pushed them to be better in their own work, try harder, work harder.  What happens as you listen to the chorus of voices is that a different kind of story starts to emerge. Talent is one thing. Michael Jackson obviously had that. But he was not just a raw genius who knew how to sing and move. Even as a child, he approached his work (and the Motown giants around him) with curiosity, inquisitiveness, and an insatiable desire to learn from them. He himself said that the key to success was \"listening.\" The documentary pays tribute to his dancing as well as his singing. Jackson was a prodigy dancer, obsessed with The Nicholas Brothers, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Sammy Davis, Jr., able to replicate their routines perfectly after watching them only once. What became his recognizable dance style had long roots in the culture, and his moves incorporated the whole history of American dance.  Advertisement One of the most gratifying sections of the documentary is the\u00a0in-depth \"Off the Wall\" discussion, song by song by song: the \"hooks,\" the rhythm sections, the horns, the guitars. Musicians reminisce about playing on that album, and contemporary musicians talk about the impact that this or that specific sound had on their own work. It's so rich and so informative that the moment I finished watching the documentary I listened to the album front to back. I grew up with Michael Jackson. I have all the albums. It may sound trite, but watching all of the footage in the documentary, the concerts, music videos, television appearances, his beautifully simple performance of \"Ben\" at the 45th Academy Awards, at age 14, drives home just how much we lost when we lost him.  The other element of Michael Jackson's career that becomes crystal clear in the documentary is the fact that nobody\u2014not even music industry people who thought Michael Jackson was talented\u2014could perceive just how big he was going to get. How many cute child-stars go on to become as huge an adult star as Michael Jackson? Who could even envision something like that? The perception of the Jackson 5 was that they were very successful, but they were a \"packaged\" commodity, a novelty act. A lot of the people at Epic didn't want them on the label. Campaigns on their behalf had to be fought all along the way, as insane as that sounds now.  Michael Jackson's career is a powerful example of what it looks like when an artist loves what he does. It's a high bar, but that's as it should be. If you don't approach your work like that as an artist, why do it? It's a concept brought up again and again in the documentary, perhaps its most emotional component. How many music stars today barely seem to like what they're doing, let alone love\u00a0it? The documentary is a reminder, and an important one, about what Michael Jackson brought to the table, and it was more than talent, it was love. That is what audiences felt when they watched Michael Jackson, and when they listened to his songs. It's why Rosie Perez almost tears up in her interview, talking about her sense of \"thankfulness\" to him because of how much joy he brought to her life. Exquisitely researched, beautifully put together, with that celebratory knowledgeable chorus of voices pouring over us, what Spike Lee's documentary really is is an act of love.

{"Title": "Can We Take a Joke?", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"It doesn't take much to rile up the outrage police these days,\" says the opening line of narration in \"Can We Take a Joke?\", Ted Balaker's documentary about the plight of comedians in the age of social media shaming, campus speech codes and mandatory apologies. \"If you're a comedian, there might be calls for your show to be cancelled \r\nif someone takes offense at your joke ... but some people are brave enough \r\nor stupid enough to fight back.\" Right away you know what this movie is: a brief for the defense. And it remains so throughout the movie's brisk 74-minute running time, as the filmmaker interviews several veteran stand-up comics, including Gilbert Gottfried, Lisa Lampanelli, Jim Norton, Heather MacDonald, Karith Foster and Adam Carolla, about how the 21st century has affected an art form that Lenny Bruce dragged kicking and screaming into the 20th. Advertisement The film will play well among standup comics who feel they've been muzzled by humorless slogan-spouting liberals, bluenoses and the generally squeamish, as well as by viewers who've bought into the idea that American college campuses have becoming havens for baby Stalinists who either won't permit contrarian thoughts to be expressed or shout them down through heckling, protests, and petitions. \"You don't walk through a museum with a towel and throw it over paintings that you don't like,\" Norton says in a standup clip about the issue. Unfortunately, the result too often plays as if you've been invited to \r\nread half of a courtroom transcript\u2014the defense's half\u2014while skipping \r\npast redacted text that might have complicated or undermined the \r\nargument. What's being advocated here is, \"Shut up and like it,\" which seems neither sporting nor especially revealing of the free speech values the movie says it's so enamored with.  There are many examples of audience members, including college students, heckling standup comics who have offended them\u2014including Reed College student Sal Rodriguez, who was heckled by a female student during a standup set making fun of women for enrolling in humanities courses while complaining that women are underrepresented in math and science, then lashed back by calling the woman a \"cunt.\" She stormed the stage, took the microphone away and demanded that he shut up and sit down.  This event, captured on video and partly replayed in the movie, is indeed outrageous\u2014no comedian performing in front of a paid audience should have their act terminated by a single audience member, no matter what the cause. And the idea of establishing a support group for anyone traumatized by his set does sound silly on its face. But as you watch the clip, you might also be struck by how poorly Rodriguez handled what most professional comics would consider a pretty unremarkable initial push-back by an audience member. If you can't shut down a heckler by being clever, conciliatory, surreal, or otherwise imaginative, you shouldn't be in standup comedy. Balaker also leaves out the follow-up to the incident\u2014Rodriguez's email calling anyone who complained about his act \"faggoty pussies.\"  Advertisement Despite the presence of Lampanelli, a white female comic in the Don Rickles-Joan Rivers mode whose outrageously cutting persona is carefully modulated, and Foster, an African-American woman who used to contribute to \"Imus in the Morning\" (a radio show not known for its sympathies to the sorts of activists criticized in this film), most of the major interviewees here are white guys in their forties or fifties who seem peeved that they can't just say anything they want and be acclaimed as brilliant satirists or harmless purveyors of fun. Their situation often seems less a portrait of righteous village truth-tellers being chased by pitchfork-wielding mobs (as suggested in a bit of old-movie footage) than of a sub-group of comedians who haven't quite adapted to a new world where audience members are unwilling to suffer grievances in silence, and can now double as critics, thanks to online platforms. Their beleaguered attitude may be justified, but despite a few cherry-picked examples of extreme or ridiculous responses\u2014and justifiable astonishment that anyone would come to see an in-you-face standup comic and not expect to be offended here or there\u2014there's not much evidence in the movie to suggest that's an open-and-shut case. And we never get close scrutiny of material that arouses such ire, much less rebuttals by writers such as Roxane Gay and Lindy West, who have written extensively on this subject (and gotten into online feuds with prominent comics like Patton Oswalt) over whether heckling, walkouts, angry editorials and the like are quasi-fascist overreactions or merely an example of answering free speech with more free speech.   There are too many unexamined premises in this film, starting with the idea that heckling, student petitions, calls for apologies and the like are \"censorship\"\u2014a word that people living in China or who survived life in the former Soviet Union understand, and would use correctly; in the US, private businesses and institutions, from Harvard to Twitter, can deny a platform, but only the government can completely muzzle an individual\u2014or if they're an unruly response to an unruly art form that amounts to a conversation between the comic and his or her audience. Standup is a mostly-one way conversation, granted. But it's one that should allow for the possibility that audiences might not like the material or find it amusing, or that the comedian may in fact be on the wrong side of an issue, or punching down (heaping abuse on groups that are essentially powerless) versus punching up (against authority figures and representatives of a repressing ruling class, Saint Lenny's targets).  Advertisement The Marx Brothers, who are background figures in this movie, also represented a spirit of anarchy and liberation; they were all about expressing impulses that we're taught to keep under wraps, and they aimed their madness at institutions, the rich, the supposedly cultured, and regular people who had comparatively little power but used it to crush the joy out of life. \"Mel Brooks, whose \"Blazing Saddles\" is often held up as an example of the kind of politically incorrect film They Don't Make Anymore, was just as sophisticated, in his lowbrow way: \"Saddles\" is filled with crude sex jokes and racial slurs, including the N-word, but it's ultimately a satire on racism and sexism, and it's always on the side of the little guy, and ultimately appeals to kindness and decency no matter how outrageous it gets. George Carlin, who died in 2009 but is a heavy presence in here via interview clips, is likewise held up as an example of why shocking, contrarian or unpleasant material should be protected. But the movie ignores the content of Carlin's material just as it dances around the gist of Bruce's: Carlin attacked government, institutionalized sexism and racism, TV networks' squeamishness about sex and profanity, the military industrial complex, corporations' contempt for consumers and the environment, and other amorphous but real and oppressive presences. And when he did a routine about how rape jokes could be funny, it still didn't treat it lightly, as several comics casually defending the right to make rape jokes do here. Although he wasn't always exact, much less always hilarious, Carlin never lost sight of who had power and who didn't, an important distinction in standup, as well as other popular art forms, that \"Can We Take a Joke?\" mostly avoids.  \"When people are outraged by something, they're also patting themselves \r\non the back, like, 'I'm a good person, and I was offended.'\" says Gottfried. Mind-reading of this kind is the last resort of the comic who is incapable of looking inward. People may, in fact, be genuinely offended, and they may have good reason to be offended\u2014and whether they're being sincere or not in their expression of that outrage, the best way to shut them down is to be so hilarious, so truthful, so connected to the entire human race, that the heckler can't do anything but laugh or leave.

{"Title": "Two Men in Town", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "This movie is a loose remake of a 1973 French crime drama written and directed by Jose\u00a0Giovanni, who wrote a handful of classic genre pictures, including Jacques Becker\u2019s\u00a0prison-break picture \u201cLe Trou,\u201d Alain Corneau\u2019s gangster-on-the-run story \u201cClasse tous\u00a0risques\u201d (both 1960) and Jean-Pierre Melville\u2019s one-last-caper \u201cLe Deuxieme Souffle\u201d\u00a0(1966). Giovanni\u2019s original was a tense, lean narrative of a paroled con dogged by an\u00a0old enemy, a cop with a grudge. This film, directed by Rachid Bouchareb, best known\u00a0in this country for his \u201cIndig\u00e8nes\u201d (aka \u201cDays of Glory\u201d), about North African soldiers\u00a0fighting for France in World War II, makes the story a bit baggier, and, in a reach for\u00a0contemporary significance, changes its setting to contemporary New Mexico and makes\u00a0its paroled criminal a convert to Islam.\u00a0 Advertisement In this update, the viewer knows things are going to end badly from the opening shots.\u00a0One of the film\u2019s characters is seen dragging an inert body over a desert landscape.\u00a0Then, in a long shot, he\u2019s seen smashing the body\u2019s head with a rock while screaming.\u00a0The perspective reminded me of a similar death-seen-from-a-great distance scene, in Abderrahmane Sissako\u2019s extraordinary 2014 \u201cTimbuktu,\u201d but where Sissako\u2019s scene\u00a0showed a quiet, implacable assurance, Bouchareb\u2019s presentation has a slight ring of\u00a0manipulative dynamics, and overdetermination. This feel persists over the course of\u00a0many perfectly-framed vistas, including a shot of Brenda Blethyn standing in a doorway\u00a0that is practically begging the viewer to compare it to \u201cThe Searchers.\u201d But Blethyn\u2019s\u00a0recognizable presence also constitutes a godsend of sorts: when this film's excellent actors\u00a0are given things to do, Bouchareb\u2019s heavy-handedness is easier to ignore.\u00a0 Blethyn\u2019s character is a parole officer. Forrest Whitaker plays Garnett, out three years\u00a0early from a twenty-year-plus sentence; seems he killed a deputy during his gang-banger\u00a0times. Harvey Keitel is Agati, a humane but exceptionally businesslike sheriff who has an\u00a0extreme grudge against Garnett. The movie takes its time with these characters. Garnett,\u00a0praised early on by his spiritual adviser on having learned to control his anger (there\u2019s\u00a0the first-act gun-mention you always hear that Chekhov quotation pulled out about), rides\u00a0around on a motorbike enjoying his newfound freedom while Agati seethes and ponders\u00a0what he\u2019s going to do about this new problem preying on his mind. Blethyn\u2019s character\u00a0gives Garnett the old tough-not-quite-love treatment, bristling when he ingenuously\u00a0boasts to her about a date with a woman he\u2019s about to go on. \u201cTell her the truth,\u201d she\u00a0bluntly advises him. And he does, eventually. But once Agati starts harassing him, and\u00a0once an old criminal associate (Luis Guzman) starts trying to lure him back into the fold,\u00a0Garnett starts coiling up into himself more and more. An explosion is bound to happen.\u00a0 The suspense is spiced up here by the culture clashes implicit in the environment and\u00a0explicit in some of the characterizations. Early in the film Keitel\u2019s sheriff asks Blethyn\u2019s\u00a0character to stop by a barbecue celebrating the return home of some troops who\u2019ve been\u00a0serving in Afghanistan. Garnett\u2019s devotion to his newfound faith doesn\u2019t impress Agati\u00a0at all: in fact it seems to deepen his resentment of the character. What\u2019s odd about \u201cTwo\u00a0Men\u201d is the fact that after establishing all of this material relative to character, Bouchareb,\u00a0who co-wrote the adaptation with Olivier Lorelle and Yasmina Khadra, allows it to\u00a0all fall away. The story builds to a climactic confrontation, but not the one, perhaps,\u00a0that we\u2019ve been expecting, and then ends on a frustratingly indeterminate note that has\u00a0little to do with the issues the movie went to the trouble to raise in the first place. As\u00a0exceptional as the acting in the picture is, and it is wonderful\u2014Whitaker and Keitel are as\u00a0inventive and surprising as they\u2019ve been in years, and the supporting roles played by the\u00a0likes of Ellen Burstyn and Stan Carp are well-sketched\u2014it can\u2019t entirely lift the movie\u00a0from the rut it has all but plowed into by the end credits.

A measure of how the world has changed is given the viewer\r\nin this movie\u2019s opening presentation logos: a welder works on a bike in a\r\nsparkling garage, while a little girl cavorts about; the logo \u201cRed Bull Media\r\nHouse\u201d manifests itself in 3D, followed by the logo of Freeride Entertainment;\r\nwe\u2019re then informed, in this garage, that what follows is \u201cSupported By\r\nSkullcandy.\u201d (Later in the movie, a motorcyclist executes a stunt from a Park\r\nCity, Utah, ski jump, and vaults over another Skullcandy logo.) The machines of\r\nescape are now lifestyle appurtenances.  What follows is all handsomely shot and not without some\r\ngeneral interest\u2014but the movie\u2019s only really going to play for you if motorcycles\r\nand those who ride them are subjects to which you\u2019re somewhat sympathetic. Dana\r\nBrown himself supplies the narration, and it\u2019s a welter of sub-MTV style\r\nadvertisements for itself; this is a story, Brown announces, \u201cthat defies\r\nstereotypes,\u201d which usually means that it rearranges a particular set of\r\nstereotypes to make it seem as if it\u2019s defying stereotypes. I mean, don\u2019t get\r\nme wrong, the stuff about the deaf female motorcyclist Ashley Fiolek is\r\ninteresting and somewhat touching, but to this viewer it would have been even\r\nmore so had I not been assured about how surprised I was going to be right at\r\nthe outset.

{"Title": "Stray Dogs", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Stray Dogs,\"\u00a0Tsai Ming-Liang's first feature in five years, is a mysterious and deliberately prolonged series of tableaus about the fragility of flesh and the smallness of humanity, among other things.\u00a0 Like most of his films\u2014but particularly ones built around very long takes, such as 2003's masterful \"Goodbye, Dragon Inn\"; his 35-minute short \"Madame Butterfly,\" which has just three shots; and this one\u2014it refuses to engage with anything resembling conventional, commercially viable storytelling. This is a director whose 1997 film \"The River\" kicked off with a locked-down shot of an escalator on which the main action was a wordless exchange of glances between a man and a woman who didn't enter the frame for half a minute.\u00a0Compared to Tsai, the hypnotically austere\u00a0Apichatpong Weerasethakul (\"Syndromes and a Century,\" \"Tropical Malady\") seems fidgety.\u00a0 Advertisement Before he decided to focus on cinema, Tsai worked in experimental theater, and if you've decided to sample his work for the first time starting with this new feature, you should bear that in mind as you watch. There is no plot to speak of here, nor are there any characters\u2014not in any conventional sense of the terms. We're not watching people pursue specific goals, solve specific problems, and learn and grow on the way to catharsis. We're just watching people exist and intuiting the story that drives them from situation to situation, and then moving on to connect the people and the landscape with basic, deep concerns: the isolation and disconnection of life in anonymous big cities; the sense of being suspended in a perpetual present even as time rolls on; the tactility of forests and roads, rooms and furniture, clothes and books, bedsheets\u00a0and\u00a0skin. Cinema often lures us into thinking about what people and places and situations represent rather than appreciating their essence. Tsai's films push against that tendency.\u00a0They might owe more to documentaries, or to theatrical installations, than to most traditional scripted features. The last ten minutes of this movie consist of an unbroken long take of characters staring at a mural. The movie begins with a long shot of a mother sitting on the edge of a bed, brushing her hair as she watches her two children (Lee Yi Cheng\u00a0and his sister\u00a0Li Yi Chieh) sleep. This woman, presumably the children's mother, vanishes from the story, and the siblings are next seen living with their dad (Lee Kang-Sheng) inside a shipping container and making pocket money holding up advertising signage at a busy urban intersection.\u00a0The film continues like that, observing the harshness of the children's lives, and their father's exhaustion and seemingly constant depression (he seems to spend a lot of the money they make as a family on alcohol and smokes).\u00a0\u201cHeaven and Earth are heartless, treating creatures like straw dogs,\" says the\u00a0Tao Te Ching.\u00a0 In one of the movie's longest, most wrenching scenes\u2014one that oddly mirrors the opening shot\u2014the father joins his two kids in bed, then rolls over, and as the camera follows his movement, it reveals a sort of mother-substitute figure: a head of cabbage with a mouth and eyes drawn on it, nestled awkwardly into a sweater. The man becomes unnerved by it, then vigorously mimes smothering it, then finally devours it, weeping cathartically.\u00a0 This is one of the strangest and most upsetting sequences I've seen in a film in a long time, precisely because the father never verbalizes the fluctuations in his emotions. There's no monologue, no voice-over. We're just watching a man lose it, step by step, until he finally seems to implode in despair, then slowly ramp down and locate his center again. Something about it reminded me of the scenes in \"Twin Peaks\" where Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) weeps as he dances with an imagined version of his murdered daughter to the tune of \"Pennsylvania 6-5000.\" I've watched that scene many times in the presence of other people; they always laugh at first, albeit nervously, but they always stop laughing as it goes on and on, and it becomes clear that we're in the presence of a man whose tether to reality has snapped. Advertisement Scene after scene in \"Stray Dogs\" drives home the difficulty of daily existence while also (perhaps paradoxically\u2014or not, if you're Buddhist, as Tsai is) making you appreciate the incidental, beautiful sights and sounds that our busyness or our pain might otherwise cause us to ignore: the way tall swamp grass rustles as the father pushes a small wooden rowboat through it; the hiss of rain on wet ground and foliage in the storm sequence; the play of sunlight on the tile and white glass of a luxury apartment that the father has wandered into (briefly experiencing, and imagining, a life of comfort). This is, as you've surely gathered, the sort of film that does not have what studio executives would call \"a pre-sold audience.\" It asks a lot of us. In fact it asks us to set aside everything we've been conditioned to think movies are, and roll with a different way of seeing and hearing things, and connect.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "A Futile & Stupid Gesture", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The good men and women of the National Lampoon changed comedy forever. The impact of their magazine and movies like \u201cAnimal House\u201d and \u201cCaddyshack\u201d can undeniably be felt in almost all modern comedy, but certainly in the quirky style of writer/actor/director David Wain. One of the members of \u201cThe State\u201d and the team behind \u201cWet Hot American Summer,\u201d Wain has always operated under the \u201ccomedy ensemble\u201d concept of filmmaking and TV, bringing together the same performers over and over again, often skewering expectations of the genre, as in his spoof of rom-coms, the underrated \u201cThey Came Together.\u201d Could he be too good a fit for the story of National Lampoon? Does this explain why \u201cA Futile & Stupid Gesture,\u201d while being full of likable and funny people isn\u2019t all that funny or likable? Because it's too much like telling your own story?\u00a0While there\u2019s a bit of hero worship going on that deflates the piece, and Wain\u2019s direction is surprisingly uninspired, the biggest problem is the script that tries to cover too much ground but doesn\u2019t really have that much to say as it does so. Advertisement There\u2019s a scene in this film about the rise of National Lampoon that sums it up in ways that writers John Aboud and Michael Colton certainly didn\u2019t intend. The writers are sitting around throwing out ideas when Tony Hendra (Matt Lucas) drops a dull idea\u2014drawing Nixon with Pinocchio\u2019s nose. For some reason, this bad joke that nearly got Hendra run out of the room kept coming back to me. Just as it\u2019s an obvious way to convey a message\u2014Nixon is a liar\u2014too much of \u201cA Futile & Stupid Gesture\u201d takes a similarly predictable route to gets its history across. The story of Doug Kenney and the ascendance of National Lampoon is told primarily through narration and montage. It\u2019s a Greatest Hits collection, hitting the beats that anyone who saw \u201cDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead\u201d already knows, and doing so incredibly superficially. The best thing about Wain\u2019s film is the casting, including one brilliant piece of meta analysis, but that only gets a movie so far.    Will Forte plays Kenney, who took the Harvard Lampoon that they helped through one of its most successful phases and turned it into an international phenomenon with his best buddy, Henry Beard (Domhnall Gleeson, giving the most grounded and interesting performance in the film despite an awful wig.) When they get to New York and found the magazine, the film rushes through a decade or so of history from the first days of groundbreaking comedy through the movies and up to Kenney\u2019s death in 1980. We meet tons of the major comedians from the era including Gilda Radner (Jackie Tohn), Bill Murray (Jon Daly), John Landis (Brian Huskey), John Belushi (John Gemberling), Christopher Guest (Seth Green), and the one and only Chevy Chase, played by his \u201cCommunity\u201d co-star Joel McHale, with whom he had a notoriously contentious on-set relationship. Imagine playing one of your least favorite co-workers in a film. McHale doesn\u2019t go for parody, nailing Chase\u2019s rhythms and comedic timing, although it\u2019s telling that Chase is portrayed here is something of an enabler for his best buddy when it comes to drugs.    Martin Mull plays an older version of Doug Kenney, which is itself a slightly crazy framing choice given that Kenney died when he was 36. So is Mull playing Kenney from the afterlife? The truth is that it\u2019s a lazy narrative choice, allowing Kenney to comment on his own story from afar, although it would have been just as effective to have Forte do these fourth-wall breaks. It\u2019s almost like someone just wanted to get Mull in the movie and the other parts were taken. The emphasis on Kenney is particularly frustrating narratively in that this is way more his story than that of Lampoon. Of course, Kenney is a breakthrough voice in comedy, but there\u2019s a more balanced version of this story that\u2019s way more interesting.    Advertisement Worst of all, \u201cA Futile and Stupid Gesture\u201d can\u2019t keep its irreverent, NL-inspired tone throughout, and Wain can\u2019t quite handle the serious stuff\u2014one gets the impression he\u2019d much rather be hanging out in the writer\u2019s room or behind-the-scenes of the radio show than dealing with Kenney\u2019s drug addiction and infidelities. The superficial reimagining of comedy highlights is kinda fun in a \u201cThe Chris Farley Show\u201d kind of way (\u201cRemember that food fight? That was awesome.\u201d) but that tone definitely doesn\u2019t work when the film has to be even remotely serious. At one point, Kenney says \u201cComedy doesn\u2019t have to be pretty. It should be fucking raw.\u201d In the way it handles both comedy and misery, I wish this movie was too.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Cars 3", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cCars\u201d and \u201cCars 2,\u201d are outliers in Pixar\u2019s lineup of critically acclaimed, family friendly blockbusters: the original made a fortune despite poor reviews, and the sequel made another fortune despite even worse reviews. A sort-of spin-off, \u201cPlanes\u201d\u2014which is not part of the extended Carsoverse, but was released by Pixar's parent company, Disney\u2014got pounded like a pi\u00f1ata by reviewers, but it made so much loot that Pixar churned out a sequel, \u201cPlanes: Fire & Rescue,\u201d one year later. And at no point in this timeline of movies about anthropomorphic vehicles did Pixar, a company that\u2019s gone to great lengths to convince us that it never does things just for the money, seem to lose sleep over the prospect that we\u2019d think they that's exactly why they were making more \"Cars\" and \"Planes\" films. Advertisement Lo and behold: here\u2019s \u201cCars 3,\u201d a smiley-faced Frankenstein\u2019s monster comprised of bits and pieces lifted from every other sports film in existence. The screenplay rips off the main plot of the Tom Cruise racing picture \u201cDays of Thunder\u201d (knowingly, though; a supporting race car character is cleverly named \u201cCruz\u201d) and merges it with bits of \u201cRocky III,\u201d the one where the champ went soft and had to find his edge again; \u201cRocky IV,\u201d where the champ had to train in snowy Siberian woods to fend off a challenger who relied on steroids and fancy machines, and \u201cCreed,\u201d where the champ realized that passing wisdom on to the next generation can be as satisfying as acquiring it when you\u2019re young. There is, at the level of plot and characterization, not a single major element in this movie that you haven\u2019t seen elsewhere, possibly in a \u201cCars\u201d or \u201cPlanes\u201d film. Despite its lack of originality, as well as its lackadaisical storytelling and world building, it satisfies in that amiably weird way that only a \"Cars\" film can.  Champion race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has been on top for so long that he has failed to notice that he\u2019s not getting any younger. He\u2019s challenged by a snotty, bullying wannabe-champ, Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer), a super-high tech car that can go 200 m.p.h. without breaking a\u2014well, cars don\u2019t sweat, but you get the idea. Following a disastrous defeat by Storm, Lightning lets his sponsor Sterling (Nathan Fillion) talk him into training in an elaborate racing simulation facility under a younger trainer, Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), who excitedly but thoughtlessly describes him as \u201cmy senior project.\u201d When Lighting wipes out there, too, Sterling informs him that he\u2019s mainly interested in using a retired Lightning as a pitchman for Rust-eze mud flaps. This leads the former champ to return to his roots in the rural holler where his late mentor Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, playing \u201chimself\u201d via outtakes and a celebrity impersonator) learned skills and tricks that he passed down to Lightning. And it\u2019s here that \"Rocky IV\" rears its meaty head, with a montage that contrasts Lightning and Cruz driving through woods and around dirt tracks against shots of Storm training in an indoor facility that looks like a place where a Bond villain might throw a Christmas party. It\u2019s not a spoiler to say that this film has a happy ending, but to its credit, for all its clich\u00e9s, it doesn\u2019t give us the ending we expect. The Doc-Lightning and Lightning-Cruz relationships suggest a passing of the torch, and \u201cCars 3\u201d finds a decent way to give us that, along with a sub-theme of female empowerment and a sincere belief in the idea that privileges have to be given up or amended if society, even a car-centric one, is going to keep evolving. The film hedges its bets here, though, as if it\u2019s trying to avoid a boycott led by the sorts of men who buy tickets to women-only screenings of \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and think they\u2019re striking a blow for civil rights. And the notion of a gendered car universe that grapples with sexism is discombobulating because the film mostly dances around the issue without mustering the nerve or the chops to properly deal with it.\u00a0(When Lightning repeatedly diminishes Cruz as \u201ca trainer\u201d rather than \u201ca racer,\u201d it sounds like he\u2019s trying to put a female car in her place, and when Storm taunts Cruz, his insults evoke a male nerd taunting a female one for not being a \"true\" fan of the thing they both love.)  Advertisement The notion of automotive gender and discrimination issues is not something the series ever tackled before; likewise the implication of a car caste system, where you're born into a particular automotive body and that defines the rest of your life, however long that is. Of course, this is a series in which cars can have baby cars, and there are car insects (or insect cars?), and in the second movie there are living planes, presumably to transport the cars long distances, inside of their bodies. And the tractors in these movies are coded as \"cattle,\" which I guess are eaten by the other cars.\u00a0  This sort of awkwardness is common in the worlds of \u201cCars\u201d and \u201cPlanes.\" The films draw jokey inspiration from the human world in ways that amuse in the moment but seem weirdly chilling when you think about them later. As many \u201cCars\u201d and \u201cPlanes\u201d obsessives have pointed out, dialogue and subplots in both and \u201cCars\u201d and \u201cCars 2\u201d suggest that this world once included humans, which raises the prospect of a \u201cTerminator\u201d- or \u201cMaximum Overdrive\u201d-like machine rebellion. A joke in the first \u201cCars\u201d referencing Jimi Hendrix makes us wonder if there was an actual Hendrix in the \u201cCars\u201d world and if so, what happened to him. If there are no humans, why do the cars have door handles? The acknowledgement of World War II in \u201cPlanes\u201d raises the question of whether there was a car Hitler, a car Hiroshima, and so on. Likewise, the rural Southern caricatures (many of these cars have bad teeth!) imply that geographical distinctions between the American North and South in our world hold true here as well, which in turns could mean there was a Civil War that pitted car against car, and that their descendants still argue over whether the war was about slavery or state\u2019s rights. (For a primer on these conundrums, see this article by Matt Singer, the Ptolemy of \u201cCars\u201d studies; you can follow it up with this piece suggesting that \u201cCars 3\u201d is a self-aware meditation on Pixar\u2019s own collective fear of aging and irrelevance.)   As examples of imaginative commercial filmmaking, the \u201cCars\u201d films range from mediocre to coldly impressive. The landscapes are photo-realistically convincing, the animators work small miracles making the cars seem lifelike and expressive, and the action sequences are stunning examples of how to deliver a lot of information quickly without confusing the audience. But as pieces of storytelling, the films are borderline inept by the standards of Pixar, a rare studio that exercises auteur-like control over every frame of every project they release. Advertisement And yet, against all odds, there is magic in these films; it just doesn\u2019t have much to do with their excellence as, well, films. That\u2019s a bummer for cinephiles but irrelevant to people seeking a movie filled with broad jokes, flashy action and canned moral lessons that will keep kids occupied for a couple of hours. In the end, it\u2019s more fun to talk about the moon-sized logical loopholes in the \u201cCars\u201d universe than it is to watch a \u201cCars\u201d movie. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s something. At their best, these movies capture the sense of heedless, goofy play that consumed us when we were little. When I was a kid I used to make my Hot Wheels cars fight each other, using their front wheels as fists. Maybe Pixar can work a scene like that into \u201cCars 4.\u201d", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "La La Land", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Musicals made me a romantic. They taught me that some emotion is so powerful that it can\u2019t be put into mere words\u2014it must be sung. Some love is so overwhelming that you just have to move your feet. With a family that loved classic films, I remember being awed by Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, thinking they were as cool as anyone in movie history. Characters in musicals not only understood love differently than those in traditional films but they turned that understanding into art\u2014dancing, singing and transcending mere dialogue to become something greater, something purer, something closer to true romance.  Advertisement We\u2019ve had some musicals since the era of Rogers & Astaire, but few that have tried to recapture that sense of fluid, magical thinking in which characters communicate with their bodies as much, maybe even more, than they do with their voices. One of many remarkable things about Damien Chazelle\u2019s \u201cLa La Land\u201d is how much energy and time it devotes to movement and music, not just lyrics. The modern movie musicals, so often based on Broadway shows, have focused heavily on songs that further plot. In Chazelle\u2019s vision, choreography matters and a simple piano refrain can have more power than a lyric. This is a beautiful film about love and dreams, and how the two impact each other. Los Angeles is filled with dreamers, and sometimes it takes a partner to make your dream come true. \u201cLa La Land\u201d opens with a bit of a fake-out in that it\u2019s a large ensemble number of a variety that we won\u2019t really see again in the movie. Cars are stuck in the notoriously awful L.A. traffic when the drivers decide to break into song called \u201cAnother Day of Sun\u201d\u2014a bit about how each day brings new hope for these young wannabe artists\u2014jumping out of the cars and dancing on the freeway. Instantly, Chazelle\u2019s direction and the dance choreography feels different. Here, and throughout the film, he works in long, unbroken takes. You can not only see the dance moves, but you can see the dancer\u2019s entire body when he or she performs them. And after the chorus-like introduction to a city of dreamers, we meet two such sun-gazers: pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and actress Mia (Emma Stone). Like any good musical, the two have a few false starts and playfully mock each other\u2019s flaws in their first scenes. But we know where this is headed and Gosling & Stone have the chemistry to make us long for them to get together. The first major centerpiece scene is a long walk between Sebastian and Mia as the sun is setting over the Hollywood Hills. They start to see similarities in one another. Mia is tired of going on worthless auditions, ones in which the producer doesn\u2019t even look up from their phone. Sebastian holds on to an ideal version of jazz, wanting to open his own club instead of selling out and playing greatest hits for tourists. And Sebastian and Mia have a clear, instant attraction. So, even as they sing about how they\u2019re not really a couple, and how this gorgeous night is wasted because they\u2019re not with their true partners, their bodies tell another story with a fantastically choreographed dance number. Stone and Gosling aren\u2019t natural singers or dancers, but they bring so much character and commitment to every movement that it doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re fluid, engaged and mesmerizing. We watch them fall in love through dance. Advertisement Of course, it helps that Gosling and Stone have the kind of star power that made so many of those classic era musicals memorable. He\u2019s smooth and charismatic; she\u2019s clever and beautiful. The phrase has lost most of its meaning, but these are movie stars. And, of course, they\u2019re more than capable when \u201cLa La Land\u201d demands greater depth, finding characters so rich that the movie would work without the music. It\u2019s a story of artistic passion, and how easy it is to get derailed from your dream. Sometimes it takes another person to push you back on to the tracks to find it again. Gosling and Stone get these characters, finding grace in their movement but emotional depth in their arcs; Stone has never been better. \u201cLa La Land\u201d also exists as a very conscious ode to the allure of classic Hollywood. The pair goes to see \u201cRebel Without a Cause\u201d (ending in one of the most magical scenes in years) and films like \u201cCasablanca\u201d and \u201cBringing Up Baby\u201d are name-dropped. We have seen dozens of films that try to capture the allure of Hollywood, often with the cynical viewpoint that it will chew you up and spit you out, but Chazelle\u2019s vision feels unique. It pays homage to musicals like \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain\u201d and Jacques Demy's \u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\u201d without every directly mimicking them. \u00a0 It\u2019s easy to let the world get you down sometimes, especially in a year like this one. It\u2019s easy to think that dreams don\u2019t come true, and that love only exists in movies. \u201cLa La Land\u201d serves to remind us that movies can still be magical, and they can still provide the channel for us to see magic in the world around us. It\u2019s not so much another day in the sun, as the characters sing in that opening number, but the dreams of the night before, the ones we wake up and try to fulfill, that keep us dancing.

{"Title": "Gett, the Trial of Viviane Amsalem", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "With \"Gett, the Trial of Viviane Amsalem,\" siblings Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz prove that they rank with the finest filmmakers alive.\u00a0 Every shot, cut, line, performance, indeed every moment in this feature is perfectly judged, always conveying precisely what it needs to convey in order to define its characters and move the story forward. And yet the result never seems merely neat or efficient. Even though \"Gett\" tells of 45-year-old Israeli woman seeking a divorce from her domineering husband, and makes unsettling points about what it means to be a woman in a religiously conservative country (or a woman in any society), the film is less an object lesson, lecture, or problem picture than a comedy-drama about the complexity of people and the elusiveness of truth. Advertisement Most of the film takes place in a small courtroom, with the plaintiff, Viviane (co-director Ronit Elkabetz, who's also an accomplished actress), suing her husband Elisha (Simon Abkarian of \"Zero Dark Thirty\") for divorce. For women, divorce is much harder to obtain in Israel than in other Westernized countries. In fact, the husband holds most of the cards and rarely has to lay any of them down. The male-dominated, religiously orthodox panel of judges overseeing the case (led by Rabbi Solomon, played by Mandy Patinkin-lookalike Eli Gornstein) insists on a high standard of proof from Viviane\u2014so high, in fact, that what should be a simple matter of filling out forms becomes an ordeal that would tax the patience of Job.\u00a0 As depicted here, an Israeli woman can't split from her spouse without proving extraordinary abuse or neglect. A simple assertion of \"We don't get along\" or \"This marriage was a mistake\" is not enough. All the husband has do to preserve the status quo is avoid taking action\u2014and that's what Elisha, a magnetic yet tactically aloof man, does in the first part of \"Gett,\" asking for delays, failing to show up in court, and otherwise stonewalling and dragging things out in an attempt to wear Viviane down. He doesn't want to grant her wish. We wonder why. There seems to be little love left between them. Is his intransigence a matter of male pride: the fear of losing face? Or does he truly love her, so much that he'd rather be miserable with her than let her go?\u00a0 The movie keeps us guessing, and even as it tightens the emotional screws, it never stops being enjoyable. That's because the filmmakers treat the courtroom as a golden opportunity for people-watching. Both the judges' elevated bench and the small tables at which the plaintiffs and defendants sit or stand feel like halves of a stage. Viviane and Elisha mostly seethe in silence, listening as their lawyers spar. The barristers are very different but seem evenly matched: pragmatic, skeptical Carmel (Menashe Noy) stumps for the plaintiff; the defendant is represented by his wily and talkative brother Shimon (Sasson Gabai), whose folksy demeanor becomes at once more endearing and more unsettling once you figure out that it's his most potent weapon. \u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement Center stage is a smaller, podium-like table where character witnesses for Viviane and Elisha come to testify. When we get accustomed to the movie's distinctive rhythms, we lean forward in our seats a little bit whenever a new face appears, because we know the character is going to be different from, but as fascinating as, whoever stood there last.\u00a0 Part of the fun lies in watching these witnesses come in with a rehearsed, polished story, only to relinquish it once judges and opposing counsel start poking holes in their facades. The cream of the crop includes Viviane's sister-in-law Rachel, a volcanically spirited woman whose testimony becomes a comic tirade against the inequities of male-female relations and the sham of marriage-as-partnership. There are also great, wise bits of observational humor involving the witnesses' inability or refusal to take direction from the judges.\u00a0 The inertia at the heart of Viviane's plight makes watching \"Gett\" an unexpectedly tense and claustrophobic experience. For a film in which the characters do a lot of talking but not much moving around, and that unfolds in a handful of mostly small and plain locations, it's as relentless as an action-adventure picture. This is partly because the stakes are so basic and clear (Viviane is miserable and depressed, and wants to be free and happy) but also because the filmmakers have chosen to tell the story in a highly, ahem, unorthodox way: by adopting the perspectives of different characters from one moment to the next; positioning their shots so subjectively, and with such geographical precision, that we feel as though we've been dropped into a new consciousness, and allowed to see through fresh eyes. We might wonder why we're seeing a character in profile for several long seconds, or from a very low angle, or partly hidden behind another character's shoulder, and then a cut will establish who's doing the looking, and all at once we find ourselves thinking about what the information at that particular moment means to the person who's seeing and hearing it as it's being delivered. The film's stylistic boldness might not have been necessary: the script is so tight and and propulsive and the large cast so skilled that the moviemakers could have just pointed the camera at the characters and probably created a reasonably thoughtful and engaging drama. But the direction is a masterstroke because it adds a literary or even poetic dimension to the movie, finding a visual analogue to the idea that the truth varies depending on who you are and where you stand.\u00a0 The filmmakers' previous work, \"To Take a Wife\" and \"7 Days,\" were superb as well, but this one is a step up in ambition and exactness. Every touch enriches or builds out the story, and yet \"Gett\" never loses focus on the heroine's plight. We're always with her, and often the throwaway touches are more devastating than the larger setbacks, as when a judge asks her if she wants water, and she politely declines, and a bailiff leaves the room anyway. You just know he's going to return with a glass of water anyway, and sure enough, he does. Rarely has such a simple gesture so clearly communicated what it means to be the heroine in a narrative you cannot control. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Dallas Buyers Club", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "To give credit where it's arguably due, \"Dallas Buyers Club,\" directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e from a screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, takes a different storytelling tack than might be expected of an aspiring-to-inspire based-on-a-true-story drama. Beginning in the mid-1980s, a period cited by journalists and historians as the height of the AIDS crisis in the United States, \"Club\" is about Ron Woodroof, a real-life figure. Woodroof was a hard-partying, ever-on-the-make quasi-cowboy who, on finding himself HIV-infected and with a very-soon-to-come death sentence hanging over him, began aggressively exploring alternative meds. He unwittingly became an advocate and activist, even as he kept himself alive for years longer than any medical experts had told him he could.  Advertisement Woodroof was also, this story tells us, a bigoted redneck who bristled with more than just fear of mortality when he got his diagnosis. \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is not just about Woodroof going up against the FDA and Big Pharma and the other institutions and individuals who kept potentially life-saving drugs from sick people who needed them; it is of course also about Woodroof's Growth As A Human Being, and how this growth allows him to work side by side with a flamboyant transsexual, a person he not only wouldn't have given the time of day to in his prior mode of life, but possibly would have given a beatdown to.  But while it highlights performances by both Matthew McConaughey (as Woodroof) and Jared Leto (as the wily, poignant transsexual Rayon) that are models of both emotional and physical commitment (both actors shed alarming amounts of weight to portray the ravages the disease wreaks on their characters), \"Dallas Buyers Club\" largely goes out of its way to eschew button-pushing and tear-jerking. Shot mostly in a direct, near-documentary style, but edited with a keen feel for the subjectivity of its main characters, \"Dallas Buyers Club\" takes a more elliptical, near-poetic approach to the lives it portrays than the viewer might expect from this kind of movie.  As I mentioned at the start of the review, the approach is admirable in theory. In practice, though, it's sometimes mildly frustrating. The struggles of people suffering from AIDS in America were epic, and involved a Physician's Desk Reference worth of meds, and a near-army of regulations and regulatory agencies; that's a lot of data for one two-hour drama, and McConaughey's character has to act as both an audience surrogate and a hero, but he's also a man struggling with potent demons. Vall\u00e9e's energetic direction keeps the narrative moving, and there's a real rush when Woodroof's hustling pays off with the creation of the movie's title entity, a sort of medical co-op that gets non-approved meds into the hands of the sick people the health care system can't or won't help.  Advertisement The moment-to-moment approach gets choppy sometimes, as when Woodroof is suddenly portrayed in a slick international-drug-smuggler mode; one gets the impression of being in a different movie. Vall\u00e9e also misjudges, I think, the scenes in which to lay on the portent, as the scene in which Woodroof muddles through his past to figure out how he got infected, and flashes back to a rather overly boogity-boogity scene in which Woodroof has aggressively unprotected sex with two women, one of whom is a junkie. On the other end of a particular spectrum, the movie's potential nod to sentiment, in the form of a potential romance between Woodroof and one of the few helpful/compassionate physicians he encounters (Jennifer Garner, who does good, understated work), seems a little half-hearted. I understand these sound like quibbles, but I'm trying to come to terms with why \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is a somewhat more dry experience than I suspect it wants to be. The movie certainly does crackle courtesy of McConaughey. Even as his character is physically wasting away, the actor is unfailing in his portrayal of Woodroof's never-say-die indomitability, and is also unimpeachable in conveying the dangerous sleazoid charm that's a carryover from Woodroof's former footloose existence.  While Jared Leto's Rayon is often used as Woodroof's foil, Leto's attentive, detail-oriented portrayal of the fragile but supremely street-smart Buyers Club partner gives the character a distinct autonomy. The cast is packed with great actors (Steve Zahn, Dallas Roberts, Griffin Dunne and Denis O'Hare among then) buckling down, and that's key to the movie's pleasures. If \"Dallas Buyers Club\" falls somewhat short in the categories of historical chronicle, emotional wallop, and information delivery, its conscientious attempts to portray a group of people in trouble in a troubled time delivers mini-epiphanies in a series of small doses. And that isn't nothing.", "Critic": "Gamma"}

Advertisement \u201cMy Life Directed\u201d opens with the scene that gave me my\r\nbiggest smile over the entire piece as Refn and the great Alejandro Jodorowsky\r\nare having a conversation that ends with the influential filmmaker giving him a\r\ntarot card reading about his soon-to-shoot follow-up to \u201cDrive.\u201d Just the idea\r\nthat Refn and Jodorowsky hang out (he comes back later in the film and fans will remember Refn was a memorable interview subject in \"Jodorowsky's Dune\") talking\r\nabout life, art, and craft fascinates me, and I was hoping the film would\r\nfulfill on that opening scene, featuring the kind of intellectual dissection of passion versus expectation that this introduction sets up. Sadly, director Liv\r\nCorfixen, who also happens to be Refn\u2019s wife, never finds the focus for her\r\npiece, sketching the production in episodic, brief interludes with her partner\r\nbut seemingly missing the most important conversations about how \u201cOnly God\r\nForgives\u201d got made. What separates \u201cMy Life Directed\u201d is the fact that while\r\nCorfixen may not have gotten the kind of Jodo-Refn conversations one would hope\r\nfor, she gets a raw, unfiltered, husband version of a world-renowned filmmaker.\r\nSo, we see Refn in bed, clearly wracked by nerves as to how \u201cOnly God Forgives\u201d\r\nwill be received by the rest of the world. He clearly loves the film, but he is\r\nobsessed, from pre-production through premiere night, with the idea that\r\naudiences will be disappointed in the fact that it\u2019s not \u201cDrive 2.\u201d This documentary\r\nmay work best viewed in conjunction with the feature because one could easily\r\nargue that the film\u2019s flaws sprung from the filmmaker\u2019s lack of confidence in\r\nhis own vision. Which brings us back to the idea that \u201cMy Life Directed by\r\nNicolas Winding Refn\u201d is a great special feature, or a bonus disc in an\r\ninevitable box set of Refn\u2019s works.

{"Title": "The Walk", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "In terms of sheer directorial craft, \"The Walk\" is masterful, but as storytelling, it's a near-disaster. That's too bad, because nobody does visceral like Robert Zemeckis. Even in his less-than-great films, there are always two or three sequences that dazzle the viewer, often by evoking the sights and sounds of an extraordinary experience in such a way that you feel as if you're participating in them along with the characters. \"The Walk,\" Zemeckis' account of Phillippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the Twin Towers of the old World Trade Center, would seem to be the ultimate Zemeckis set piece, rivaling the awesomeness of the plane crash and island sequences of \"Cast Away,\" the upside-down jet maneuver in \"Flight,\" the intergalactic wormhole trips in \"Contact,\" and the small-scaled relentlessness of the suspense sequences in his under-appreciated 2000 thriller \"What Lies Beneath\" (which wrung tremendous excitement from the question of whether a nearly paralyzed woman could use her big toe to remove the stopper from a bathtub drain).  Advertisement The final half-hour of \"The Walk\" is on that level. It's hard to imagine how it could have done a better job imagining every physical detail of the hero's unmatched physical achievement. Following the movie's New York Film Festival premiere, there were reports of people throwing up in the men's room after suffering virtual vertigo while watching Petit (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) stroll, turn and even lie down upon a cable stretched between the towers. In this respect, \"The Walk\" does not disappoint. Zemeckis is on a short list, along with Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock, of filmmakers who understand how to fuse audacity with simplicity, so that the scale of the flourishes in their biggest sequences is wed to recognizable emotions. He makes sure that you don't just understand how Petit did what he did, but what he might have been feeling during every step of his journey, and what he saw and heard. The metallic creak of the cable as Petit walks; the rustle and hiss of wind passing over his clothes and through his hair; the muffled sound of traffic noises floating up from 110 stories below: \"The Walk\" makes these and other sensations palpable, along with Petit's delight, defiance and moments of doubt and fear.  If only Zemeckis had faith in his filmmaking power! What \"The Walk\" is missing, unfortunately, is an ability to recognize when poetry and mystery are enough and should be left alone to breathe. Here is a movie about a man whose life was defined by a \r\ndaring, unprecedented and now un-repeatable artistic feat (transforming boxy skyscrapers into a stage high above \r\nNorth America's largest city) and who achieved that feat by trusting in his \r\ntraining and bravery and will. But the script, credited to Zemeckis and Christopher Browne, begins diminishing his achievement immediately with tedious chatter, and can't stop doing it.  The movie kicks off with a poorly CGI'd (for Zemeckis) shot of the hero standing in the \r\nStatue of Liberty's torch with the Towers looming across the water \r\nbehind him, talking and talking and talking not to you but at you, often in bizarrely \r\ngargoyle-ish close-ups, about the amazing thing he's about to do, or is doing\u2014as if convincing us to buy a ticket to the film we're already sitting there watching.  \"You're doing too much!\" warns the hero's mentor (scene-stealer Ben Kingsley) early in the movie. \"Do nothing!\" The movie ignores its own advice. If the point were to show how the hucksterish aspect of Petit diminished \r\nhis physical feats, and paint a portrait of an insufferable and in some \r\nways untrustworthy salesman-adventurer who's in love with himself, it might have been defensible, but \r\nthat's not the case. We're supposed to take everything Petit says \r\nat face value. We're supposed to adore him. His narration is an \r\ninsurance policy intended to guarantee audience involvement and make sure we never fail to understand any point.  Advertisement \"The Walk\" starts selling itself to you the second you settle into your chair (\"To walk on the wire, this is life!\" Petit tells us, jamming his face into the lens). It keeps selling and selling and selling itself, telling you how amazing and wondrous everything is via voice-over and straight-into-the-camera narration, verbally explaining things that Zemeckis' images are already doing a peerless job of showing you, sometimes breaking the movie's spell by having the hero chime in with an observation that's nowhere near as eloquent as the sight of Petit doing what only Petit can do. Petit's narration might be the most counterproductive and irritating narration ever to be glommed onto a potentially great motion picture. Suffering through it is like visiting the Grand Canyon or the Metropolitan Museum of Art with someone who keeps exclaiming how incredible and astonishing everything is every fifteen seconds, to the point where you want to leave and come back the next day by yourself so that you have an actual experience. \"And with this pencil stroke, my fate was sealed,\" the narration tells us, over images of Petit drawing a line between the towers as depicted in a magazine ad that he peruses while waiting to see a doctor\u2014as if we couldn't figure out why that moment is important, in a movie about a guy who tightrope-walked between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. \"This is the beginning of my dream!\" The nadir of the movie's poor judgment occurs during its still-mostly-astonishing climax, when Petit lies down on the cable, engulfed in misty cloud cover, and watches a lone gull hovers over him and seems to stare into his eyes, as if wondering if he's some kind of bird, too. The moment has the eerie mesmerizing power of an incantation, but sure enough, here comes Petit in voice-over telling us about how this bird came out of the clouds and hovered there over him and dammit, movie, don't you know we have eyes and ears? I don't believe in the admonition \"show, don't tell.\" It's a maxim cited by hack screenwriters who make money from how-to books and seminars, not from actual screenwriting. Some of the greatest films in cinema history have active, insistent, even constant narration. But such films are not just telling in place of showing. They're showing while they're telling and telling while they're showing, and the verbal component adds to, and often complicates or subverts, the images and sounds. That's not the case here. Aside from a few practical observations about being an acrobat, there is nary a word of Petit's narration that couldn't be red-lined for redundancy. If what you want is to hear people talk about Petit (including Petit), you might as well buy a copy of the memoir upon which the \"The Walk\" is based, or watch James Marsh's great 2008 nonfiction film \"Man on Wire,\" which includes so many re-enactments that it's half a drama, anyway.  Advertisement \"The Walk\" is worth seeing on a big screen for its final wire walk (intrusive voice-over notwithstanding), for its lovingly recreated images of the World Trade Center, for its often wry humor (including a marvelous running gag involving an elevator operator) and for some of the supporting performances (notably Kingsley's pitch-perfect mentor performance, and James Badge Dale's turn as a wise-ass Franco-American who joins the team infiltrating the towers). Gordon-Levitt is verbally miscast (his Franch acc-SANT is too theatrical and might make you wish they'd cast an actual French actor) but physically convincing; you buy him as a man driven to achieve the impossible, and willing to do the hard work necessary to hone his skills, and you also believe him as a charismatic, selfish leader whose hint of madness is as attractive as it is troubling. But this is ultimately a frustrating work. \"The Walk\" has everything it needs to be a modern classic, except for an understanding that when you have everything you need to make a such a film, it doesn't need to hype itself and explain itself. It can just be.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Blackfish", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Blackfish\" is the newest example of subgenre of documentaries that could be the 21st century animal rights version of abolitionist pamphlets. \u00a0\"Sharkwater,\" about the organized butchery of sharks, \"The Cove,\" about the mistreatment of dolphins, and Gabriela Cowperthwaite's new film about orcas aren't subtle, but they aren't trying to be. They aim to document abuse and inspire reform.\u00a0 Where 2009's\u00a0\"The Cove\" exposed the theme park chain's role in dolphin kidnapping, abuse and slaughter, \"Blackfish\" does the same with orcas. It uses\u00a0Sea World trainer\u00a0Dawn Brancheau's 2010 death in a killer whale tank as a springboard for a tale of decades-long corporate conspiracy. Sea World is its main target, but the film also wants to attack received wisdom about humankind's dominion over nature, and make us feel guilty for treating fellow sentient beings as clowns.\u00a0 Advertisement Once you accept that orcas are intelligent and emotionally complex creatures, it becomes impossible to shrug off the film's darker factoids as the cost of keeping families entertained.\u00a0We learn how whale families, or pods, are hunted in their natural habitat, and how calves are separated from their parents, and how some pod members are killed on the spot. A grey-haired seaman recalls a sea park-financed calf hunt that ended with cow and bull carcasses being stuffed with rocks so that they'd sink the ocean floor. He weeps at the memory, and says it's the worst act he's ever been part of.\u00a0 The more we learn about the lives or orcas in captivity, the more inevitable the violence seems. \u00a0The confinement of mammals that are meant to roam free over hundreds of kilometers; the \"training\" that requires them to do tricks on command or be punished with solitary confinement and the withholding of food; the whale-on-whale violence caused partly by orcas being forced to share tight space in tanks with orcas that they might not choose to associate with in the wild: these and other facts make the marine park sound like a combination circus, super-max prison and slave labor camp. (Oddly, the parallels to slavery, while impossible to miss, are the only aspect of this expose that are allowed to emerge organically from the material.)\u00a0 Tilikum, the bull that killed Brancheau, has a history of violence, but given what he's been through we can hardly blame him. An appalling moment in \"The Cove\" revealed how a dolphin who played Flipper on TV got so depressed in captivity that she killed herself. You may be reminded that humans hang themselves in jail under less dire circumstances than these mammals endure. There's only so much abuse that a being can take without wanting to kill someone, or itself.\u00a0 Cowperthwaite, her editor Eli B. Despres (who also cowrote the movie) and her composer Jeff Beal invoke many genres: thriller, mystery, melodrama, snuff film. There are cartoon recreations of a court case pitting Sea World against the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which forced the park to keep whales and trainers separate. There are graphic images of trainers being mauled and whales being \"raked\" by fellow whales in captivity, blood clouding the water.\u00a0 Advertisement There were times when I wished \"Blackfish\" would trust its audience more. The archival bits\u2014 including robotically cheerful testimonials from a \"typical\" Sea World-loving family and\u00a0a 1985 TV ad trumpeting the arrival of \"Baby Shamu\"\u2014are so corrosively funny that they might have been spliced in from a Paul Verhoeven picture.\u00a0The shots of whales lashing out in desperation and the closeups of tearful trainers begging forgiveness for their role in past abuse are innately powerful. Arguably none of these elements needed to be \"helped\" with \"Monday Night Football\"-style gimmicks and \"you will cry now\" music; but the filmmakers could counter with Malcolm X's \"by any means necessary\"\u2014and perhaps they should. Sea World has issued a\u00a0point-by-point refutation\u00a0of some the charges. I doubt they'll reclaim sympathy by quibbling over details when the rough outlines of the orca trade are so grotesque.\u00a0A third of the way through \"Blackfish,\" I imagined myself as a child watching my family being murdered, then growing up in a prison where I had to do degrading tricks for cheering crowds who'd been assured that I adored the place.

{"Title": "Mojave", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Mojave\" opens with Garrett Hedlund, with only slightly\r\nscruffier hair and beard than Ted Neeley had in \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d\r\ncomplaining to a video camera about the ennui of having been world famous since\r\nthe age of 19, and then elaborating on that discontent: \u201cYou wanna be like\r\nByron, you wanna go to Greece, you wanna run guns in Africa,\" that last bit alluding\r\nto Rimbaud\u2019s post-\u201cA Season In Hell\u201d career.

This fellow, Jack, played by Oscar Isaac, grins, but as Hedlund\u2019s Thomas, he glowers. What the\r\nhell is going on here? Advertisement What can I tell you? When a literary author whose career in\r\nbook-writin\u2019 has been kinda-sorta hijacked by Hollywood, weird feelings tend to fester under the affluent lifestyle.\r\nFor this film, the second to be both written and directed by William Monahan,\r\nturns out to not be the Academy-Award-winning screenwriter\u2019s homage to Gus Van\r\nSant\u2019s \u201cGerry,\u201d but a revenge thriller set largely in the fleshpits of\r\nTinseltown. What happens is, surly Thomas gets a\r\nbit of a jump on Jack, but in the process kills another man, an\r\ninnocent\u2014although in the world Monahan envisions, no one is truly innocent,\r\nexcept maybe the six-year-old kid who rather predictably melts into a father\u2019s\r\nembrace in the movie\u2019s coda.\u00a0 Discovering that there\u2019s a serial killer roaming\r\nthe very desert he\u2019s leaving (he called a limo from a motel), Thomas, remaining\r\nsurly, goes back to Hollywood, secretes a revolver in the platform of his TV\r\ndisplay (on which he watches the Death Valley climax of Erich von Stroheim\u2019s \u201cGreed,\u201d\r\na totally typical touch), and consults with sleazy lawyer Walton Googins and\r\nargues with sleazier studio head Mark Wahlberg, and has desultory sex with\r\naloof and not-his-wife French Person Louise Bourgoin. But this is not enough\r\nHell on Earth for Thomas. Jack finds an address on the abandoned Jeep\u2019s\r\nregistration, says \u201cGame on,\u201d and hitchhikes to L.A., to engage in some\r\noccasionally \u201cStrangers On A Train\u201d style cat-and-mouse with Thomas. Monahan\u2019s conception of Thomas as an unlikable but\r\nnevertheless idealized imperial artist\u2014the film director as Calvin Klein model,\r\nKurt Cobain and Jim Morrison combined, only as well read as Harold Bloom\u2014is\r\nonly slightly less ridiculous than his conception of Jack as Thomas\u2019 secret\r\nsharer, an artist-manqu\u00e9-turned-killer of similar erudition. (At one point Jack\r\nbrags of having a \u201cJohn Stuart Mill\u201d-level IQ.) There is something kind of funny about these two bro-styled men arguing\r\nabout the accuracy of a George Bernard Shaw quote while kicking the crap out of\r\neach other, but I\u2019m not sure how much Monahan knows that, smart as he is. Like\r\nClifford Odets in his stage play \u201cThe Big Knife,\u201d Monahan sees show-biz decadence as\r\npractically apocalyptic. \"Who\u2019s the author surrogate?\" you may wonder. And this\r\nis part of the point. When Jack says, to a dog, \u201cThe Internet is a pain in the\r\nass. One can\u2019t give it too much of a place in one\u2019s life. It is a tool,\u201d well,\r\nthere\u2019s a clue right there. But eventually you figure he\u2019s got to fess up and\r\ngive his loyalty to the guy who\u2019s actually got some IMDB credits. Or does he?\r\n\u201cDo you know yet which one of us is the Bad Guy?\u201d one of the characters asks at\r\na tense moment; Monahan clearly wants to get maximum mileage out of that\r\nquestion.

Of the two leads, it\u2019s the impossibly sly and\r\ncharismatic Isaac, as you may have guessed, who has the upper hand, and he\r\nclearly relishes reeling off Monahan\u2019s loquacious dialogue, which makes a point\r\nof flirting with the most eyeroll-inducing pretensions. Wahlberg is pretty\r\nfunny playing a thoroughly repellent wannabe mogul (movie inside-baseball nuts\r\nwill be diverted by some obvious clues as to which real-life figure the\r\ncharacter might be based on) while Bourgoin is boldly non-ingratiating as the\r\nShallow Girlfriend In Peril.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Meru", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The connection between the legendary George Mallory and\r\nrenowned climber Conrad Anker, one of the subjects \u201cMeru\u201d is more than just\r\nhistorical. Believe it or not, Anker is the man who found Mallory\u2019s body on\r\nMount Everest in 1999, which made headlines around the world. Anker also seems\r\nto wholeheartedly subscribe to the theory captured by Mallory\u2019s three most\r\nfamous words: \u201cBecause it\u2019s there.\u201d In\r\nthat oft-quoted phrase, so much of the human desire to surmount the impossible\r\nis captured. Although the quote is often misinterpreted as a way to offer proof\r\nof inconsequential reasons to do what logic tells us we should not. Another\r\ninterpretation is that there aren\u2019t words to capture why people go to the Moon,\r\ncome back from the brink of death, or climb Mount Everest. They just do.\r\nBecause it\u2019s there. The men of \u201cMeru\u201d tried to go to a place that all common\r\nsense dictated they should not. They tried to climb a sheer wall that no one\r\nhad ever climbed before. Their story is undeniably interesting. However, and\r\nthis is the tricky part about reviewing documentaries, the movie about that\r\nstory is flawed. A bit too much time is spent in admiration and hero worship\r\nover the indefatigable will of these men, when it is the footage on that\r\nmountainside that matters. It\u2019s a story that speaks for itself, and so the\r\nemphasis on talking heads explaining it to us is dispiriting.  Advertisement The Shark\u2019s Fin on Mount Meru has long been the ultimate\r\nprize in mountain climbing. It is a ridiculous creation of Mother Nature,\r\nperched over 20,000 feet above the Ganges River and essentially flat and\r\nstraight-up. It is not a mountain; it is a wall. At the most challenging part\r\nof its ascent, climbers often travel 200 meters in ONE DAY. That\u2019s the\r\ninch-by-inch progress it takes to get to the top. And if you plan poorly or\r\nmerely get hit by bad weather, you better turn around if you ever want to see\r\nyour family again. As explained in the film, it is the anti-Everest in that\r\nthere are no Sherpas. No help. No one to do the grunt work. You are on your own\r\nclimbing a smooth, featureless face. In October 2008, Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin (credited with\r\nco-directing \u201cMeru\u201d) and Renan Ozturk tried to tackle Meru. They filmed much of\r\nthe perilous journey, and this material is easily the strongest in \u201cMeru.\u201d When\r\nthe filmmakers stop the musical score and stop the narration, and simply allow\r\nus to listen to the wind and the snow pummeling these men, the physical\r\nchallenge is palpable. The trio failed in 2008. In a remarkable scene, they look\r\nalmost close enough to the summit to touch it, but they figure out that the sun\r\nwill set soon, they have nowhere to camp, and they would not survive the\r\nconditions. They look like they literally could throw something to the top, but\r\nthey have to turn back and go all the way back down. They were 100 meters away.\r\n Defeated, it looks unlikely that the trio will go back\r\nagain. In an interesting footnote not given enough attention, Jimmy reveals\r\nthat it was the failure of another group of climbers to reach the top that\r\nreally got him thinking about attempting it again. There\u2019s something so\r\nattractive about being the first.\r\nRisking your life to be #2 isn\u2019t as exciting. And so after some remarkable\r\nspeed bumps are placed in their way but surpassed, the trio takes another shot\r\nat it. \u201cMeru\u201d works best, by far, in its \u201cYou Are There\u201d moments.\r\nYou hear heavy breathing, the elements whip the tent, and it sounds like the\r\nworld is ending. At one point in the first climb\u2014and it\u2019s really why it failed\u2014they\r\nare stuck, literally, on the side of the mountain for FOUR DAYS, as the\r\nelements made it impossible to move.

Looking over Cage\u2019s resume, I considered the\r\nfollowing phrase carefully: \u201cPay the Ghost,\u201d out in very limited release today,\r\nis a new low for Nicolas Cage. Just when you thought he couldn\u2019t get any more apathetic\r\nabout a role, he pops up in this lazy, boring retread of \u201cInsidious\u201d that even\r\nhis most diehard fans should ignore.  Advertisement Based on a novella by Tim Lebbon, \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d stars Cage\r\nas Mike Lawford, an English teacher who drops references to Lovecraft and Johann\r\nWolfgang von Goethe just so you get the impression that Dan Kay\u2019s screenplay\r\ncomes with great literary aspirations. (Spoiler: It does not.) Lawford is married to Kristen (Sarah\r\nWayne Callies), and the two have a child named Charlie (Jack Fulton). Of\r\ncourse, Mike is a distant dad, not around enough as he tries to earn tenure at\r\nthe university where he teaches. On Halloween, Lawford finally gets tenure, and comes home to celebrate with his family. He even\r\nconvinces his wife to let him take Charlie to a late-night Halloween parade (do\r\nthose things really happen in NYC in 2015?)

Is Charlie trying to\r\ncommunicate to them from the other side? With a laughably small amount of\r\nresearch, Mike notices that while children who go missing are often found,\r\nthose who disappear on All Hallow\u2019s Eve rarely come home again. Someone, or\r\nsomething, is abducting kids on October 31st, and many of the\r\nguardians of the abductees tell the same story of the titular phrase being said\r\njust before they disappeared. Who is the ghost that must be paid? What must he\r\nor she be paid with? Does this have something to do with Cage\u2019s notorious IRS\r\nproblems? It\u2019s amazing how long \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d drags itself through a feature-length running time with almost nothing to speak of in terms of plot.\r\nCharlie disappears, and dad looks for him. The set-up is a slog, as we know\r\nthere\u2019s no movie without dad making contact with his son again, and there\u2019s\r\nabsolutely no style or character to get us over the lack of narrative suspense.\r\nCage doesn\u2019t even give it his wide-eyed all; he\u2019s more fun in \u201cLeft Behind.\u201d\r\nPerhaps presuming that director Uli Edel would actually dramatically ground \u201cPay the Ghost\u201d\r\nin something relatable, Cage actually plays it straight, which eliminates any\r\nB-movie fun that could even be had with this misstep.

{"Title": "Filth", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 1994 \"Pulp Fiction\" gets a lot of grief for wellspringing, that is, for inspiring a container ship gross of (largely) inferior \"edgy\" genre pictures overstuffed with blood, guts, octane, and classic rock soundtracks. To spread around disapprobation where it\u2019s due, I think the 1996 film version of Irvine Welch\u2019s novel \"Trainspotting,\" as good a film as that was, also brought into being a subgenre that got real tired real fast, a subgenre involving the gritty and repellent depiction of a world of sex and drugs, a depiction that also partakes of a certain giggly amorality (calling itself \"anarchy,\" or something more high-minded), while playing that against an occasional po-faced assessment of the consequences of such a mode of life. Facile \"pungent\" irony and alternative rock soundtracks optional.  Advertisement In 2014, there\u2019s actually something mildly anachronistic about \"Filth,\" writer-director Jon B. Laird\u2019s adaptation of a 1998 novel by Welch. The movie\u2019s opening credits play over a retro-lounge rendition of \"Winter Wonderland.\" There\u2019s a low-angle shot of what appears to be the world\u2019s longest dressing room floor, black and white chessboard tile, and at the end of the line, a beautiful woman in lingerie with her back to the camera is putting on lipstick, looking at herself in the mirror. It\u2019s all very 1995 imagining it\u2019s 1957. When DOES this movie take place, anyway? The fact that its lead character, Bruce Robertson, is seen watching a television program (or \"programme\" as they say across the pond; the movie is set and was made in Scotland) featuring papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 headed character Frank Sidebottom suggests late \u201880s-early \u201890s. The fact that he\u2019s watching said programme while masturbating and making an obscene phone call to the unsuspecting wife of a \"friend\" says a bit about Bruce\u2019s character, of course. He\u2019s a cop, a bad one, and he\u2019s gunning for promotion, and his obscene phone call stunt is one of the many machinations he\u2019s using to achieve that aim. Or so he believes.  To be fair to \"Filth,\" which boasts a creditable cast featuring James McAvoy (in the lead role), Jamie Bell, Eddie Marsan, Imogen Poots, Jim Broadbent, and others, the movie is not exactly what its initial flurry of sarcastic voiceover (\"When did a single-figure IQ ever hold anyone back in the police force?\"), cheeky irony, and unrelenting depiction of drinking and drugging make it seem. It\u2019s actually something just a bit worse. Rather than a how-sweet-to-be-a-lout story that turns semi-cautionary, \"Filth\" attempts to depict genuine madness. More than merely an out-of-control sybarite prone to the corrupting influences of power, Robertson is supposed to be a Genuinely Broken Man. One who Used To Be Good. Or at least Had Potential. I understand such things do happen in life, but in \"Filth,\" the movie, such things are laid out in ways that become almost reliably predictable and unenlightening. A side trip for the lead characters to Hamburg ends with the boys chased out of a sex club to the strains of \"99 Luftballoons,\" can you believe it?  As the movie goes on, what had at first blush seemed a Macbeth-type scheme on Robertson\u2019s part is revealed to be a complete non-starter, and the viewer is ostensibly plunged into the character\u2019s tortured psyche. But there\u2019s nothing really revealing therein, just more pastiche; a character who morphs into a version of Carroll\u2019s White Rabbit, a dialogue exchange that turns into a musical number. McAvoy\u2019s nudge-nudge performance has a similarly tired quality. \"Filth\" demonstrates that contemporary filmmakers would do well to find \r\nnew ways of getting their hands dirty. On the plus side, a viewing of \r\nthe movie might temporarily cure just about anyone\u2019s nostalgia for the \r\nmud.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Divorce Corp", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The inevitable DVD of \"Divorce Corp\" will make an ideal gift for anyone who's been through a painful, expensive split-up. Directed by Joseph Sorge, whose web site offers a tie-in book, it's billed as \"A shocking expos\u00e9 of the inner workings of the $50 billion a year U.S. family law industry\" that \"shines a bright light on the appalling waste, and shameless collusive practices seen daily in family courts.\"  Those intensifiers should tell you what you're in for. \"Divorce Corp\" is less a nuanced documentary than a cry of rage. It's easy to imagine people who've shelled out a small fortune during a contested divorce, with or without kids underfoot, watching this film while nodding their heads and muttering, \"Amen. Stick it to 'em.\"  Advertisement Although it sometimes wanders off the righteous path to recount a depressing or perverse anecdote at length\u2014such as the tale of a ridiculously expensive child custody evaluator who bragged of drug use and unprotected group sex on Facebook\u2014for the most part it's a stylistically bland work. \"Divorce Corp\" is directed and edited at roughly the same level of imagination as a network newsmagazine story: talking head, talking head, talking head, cut to a chart, exterior shot of a courthouse, cut to another chart, talking head, capped by a segue along the lines of, \"And if you think that's shocking, wait'll you hear this.\"  Any wit it exhibits is of the slow-twisting-of-the-knife variety. A sequence that picks apart the undefined legal phrase \"the best interest of the child\" is scored to a section of \"March of the Sugarplum Fairies.\" Animated re-creations of witnesses' stories contain odd moments of caricature, as when a faceless stick figure representing a child custody evaluator takes a parent's hard-earned money and bolts like a cartoon swindler trying to make the next train out of town. That said, I'd be shocked if anyone involved with \"Divorce Corp\" gave the briefest thought to making an artistic statement. This picture is just a statement, period\u2014something like, \"Divorce in the United States is needlessly complicated, expensive, unfair, and sometimes corrupt. Won't someone do something about it, for pity's sake?\" The damning facts and figures keep piling up, along with horror stories that give them human faces. The average contested divorce in the United State of America costs $50,000. Lawyers on both sides of a case crank out redundant paperwork, unnecessary motions and pointless letters because they get paid by the hour. Costs climb so high that soon-to-be-former spouses have to sell cars, houses and other possessions to pay legal fees, and sometimes judges pre-emptively denude their net worth by placing liens on their property. Nobody involved wants to end what this movie calls \"the revenue stream.\" Judges are officially or unofficially in bed with lawyers for both spouses, as well as the various experts they assign to cases. It's a mutual backscratching thing. If the judge takes care of these people today, once the judge retires the recipients of largesse will take care of him, perhaps by hiring him to serve as a mediator or consultant.  Advertisement Adding incompetence to corruption, the family court system is a steaming mess. Its various sections aren't governed by constitutional edicts that other institutions must follow. Power-tripping judges can indulge God complexes by lashing out against plaintiffs who protest their decisions. At one point the film tells of a man who wrote about his experiences in family court online and was ordered to delete his blog by the judge overseeing his divorce. This is but one of many examples the film gives of judges behaving like old-time ward bosses or petty gangsters. There are no stories in \"Divorce Corp\" of fair judges or decent lawyers or government employees who are good at their jobs, and little analysis of the larger systemic problems that might account for some of the horror stories. It's not that kind of film.  The fact that \"Divorce Corp\" is railing against targets that it's safe to hate (cold-hearted and anonymous institutions, incompetent evaluators, sleazy lawyers, corrupt or petty judges) gives it darkly exhilarating quality. If you want to let off steam, it's cheaper to go out into a field and scream your head off than to buy a ticket to see it; but then you wouldn't have the pleasure of seeing prominent lawyer Gloria Allred admit on camera that the goal of most attorneys in divorce cases is to \"paper the other side until they can't take it anymore.\" If this movie were a person, it would be the kind of person you'd avoid because you fear he might explode one day and you'd rather not be there when it happens.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Light Between Oceans", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Great drama requires trust. The director has to trust his actors to convey the complexity of the human experience without smothering their performances in manipulative filmmaking devices. He also has to trust the viewer to bring their own interpretations and emotions to the story, meeting the characters halfway along the spectrum of the human experience. Derek Cianfrance can\u2019t find this trust in \u201cThe Light Between Oceans,\" an adaptation of M.L. Stedman\u2019s novel. It's a film with greatness within that\u2019s been lost due to varying degrees of distrust; ridiculously tight close-ups in soft focus feel like they\u2019re pushing you to cry instead of allowing emotion to come organically. Narrative beats and themes are hit repeatedly, just to make sure you don\u2019t miss an opportunity to feel something. Buried beneath this melodrama\u2014but shining through nearly enough to justify a look\u2014one can see the film that could have been, as anchored by great performances and emotional truth. It\u2019s just lost in the fog. Advertisement Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender, giving a very measured, confident performance) is a World War I veteran battling Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder before his condition really had a name. In some of the film\u2019s best scenes, we learn that Tom has been burdened by the randomness of life and death. Why did he live but his fellow soldiers die? One almost gets the sense that Tom doesn\u2019t think he \u201cdeserves\u201d to have made it home, and that he\u2019s going to spend the rest of his life in solitude, refusing to take the creature comforts that other young men lost forever when they went to war. To that end, Tom signs up to take a job that not many would want, manning an extremely remote lighthouse in Australia, at a spot in which one can see two oceans from its top. The last lighthouse keeper was fired when he told someone that he allowed his wife to signal a passing ship. The break in protocol was a small problem\u2014the fact that his wife had been dead a few years was a much bigger one. And yet this not-at-all-coveted job changes Tom\u2019s life when he meets the daughter of his new boss, a headstrong and beautiful young lady named Isabel (Alicia Vikander). Before long, Isabel and Tom are married, planning to start a family on Janus Island. Isabel gets pregnant, but loses the baby in a heartbreaking scene in which Tom is in the lighthouse and she can\u2019t get to him. She gets pregnant again. Tragedy strikes again.  While Isabel and Tom are mourning the loss of their second child, a miracle happens. A rowboat washes ashore, carrying a dead body and a baby. No one on the mainland knows that Isabel lost the second baby. They could just take this new child as their own and no one would know any differently. At first, the plan seems to work perfectly as Isabel, Tom, and their new daughter Lucy find happiness, but a visit to the mainland forces an encounter between Tom and a mysterious woman (Rachel Weisz) that changes everything. Advertisement Derek Cianfrance has undeniable skill with actors, drawing masterful performances out of Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams in \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d and his large ensemble in the highly underrated \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines.\u201d That skill is evident here mostly in Fassbender\u2019s largely internal turn. His take on Tom is often stoic, haunted by the ghosts of World War I in a way that makes him quiet, sometimes uncertain. Vikander often goes in the other direction, offering the more extreme emotions that Tom keeps hidden, but she\u2019s rarely given the room to breathe life into the performance. And I mean that almost literally. Cianfrance and cinematographer Adam Arkapaw put us right in her face in extreme close-up, thinking that this will help force an audience response. It\u2019s distracting more than effective, as is the soft focus and overcooked score by Alexandre Desplat. When Arkapaw and Cianfrance let their characters breathe, or even when they admire the gorgeous landscape, the film feels more effective and less manipulative. Ultimately, it comes back to trust. Don\u2019t force us to feel, trust that we will do so.\u00a0This is a film that I kept wanting to emotionally connect with and give myself over to the human power of its tragedy, but it kept pushing me away. With the undeniable, unwavering skill of the trio of actors at the film's center, we would have followed them through this heartbreaking tale without the signposts that tell us what to feel along the way.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Matt Shepard Is a Friend of Mine", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Matt Shepard is a Friend of Mine\" is a great documentary. It might face an uphill battle to be seen, because it revisits\u00a0a crime that sparked\u00a0national\u00a0reckoning\u00a0with the\u00a0reality\u00a0of homophobia, and that eventually led to the creation of The Matthew Shepard Foundation and the passage of the\u00a0Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\u00a0I hope people discover it. It is wrenching but never exploitive. It\u00a0is impressively skeptical of the same mission that it takes on its shoulders: to make something positive from a senseless crime without\u00a0diminishing\u00a0its senselessness. This film doesn't just revisit an atrocity, it moves through it, and finds meaning in it.\u00a0 Advertisement The story starts on the night of\u00a0Oct. 12, 1998, when Shepard, a 21-year old college student, was offered a ride home by two young men,\u00a0Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, then tied to a fence, viciously beaten, and abandoned. Shepard died of his injuries. In the ensuing trial,\u00a0McKinney\u2019s lawyer tried to keep his client out of prison through the \"gay-panic defense,\" in which defendants who think they've been the object of homosexual advances claim they were seized by \"a\u00a0psychotic state characterized by unusual violence.\"\u00a0 Director Michele Josue, who knew Shepard, frames the story as\u00a0her own meditation on Shepard's life and death. This would seem self-aggrandizing if the filmmaker didn't quickly move beyond herself and distribute her attention democratically among Shepard's family and friends. In the second half, she widens the film's scope and shows how the news of the crime and trial affected strangers: not just gays and lesbians who saw Shepard's killing as a worst-case-scenario projection of their own experiences with harassment and violence (a teary-eyed Ellen DeGeneres is glimpsed briefly at a public memorial service), but anyone who was offended by displays of ignorant savagery, and frustrated by the tendency of America's legal system and popular culture to make excuses for them. Much of the film is about Shepard coming to terms with his sexual orientation, then getting beyond his cultural roots and building his own identity. His mother Judy remembers how the young Matt Shepard always wanted to dress as Dolly Parton on Halloween\u2014she worries that this is a stereotypical signifier, but still seems moved by the memory\u2014and his father Dennis recounts his own no-big-deal reaction to his son's decision to come out to him. We learn that Shepard traveled the world, and we hear loved ones reading aloud from letters he wrote to them. In an especially affecting passage, we learn that Shepard was raped by several men in an alley in Morocco, an event that influenced his decision to move back home to Wyoming. Advertisement Throughout, \"Matt Shepard Was a Friend of Mine\" does an admirable job of taking a man who's been turned into a symbol and making him a man again\u2014a young man. We get a sense of a life unfolding before us, a personality shifting and changing, a voice finding itself: the middle section of the movie, which focuses on Shepard's personal evolution, is one of the best examples I've seen recently of cinema's ability to universalize a singular experience.\u00a0No matter who you are or where you come from, you'll probably see yourself represented in some part of Shepard's life\u2014which makes that same life's premature extinction all the more saddening, of course. The film also captures that aching void left by a sudden death: that sense that a hole has been torn in reality. The sense of dislocation is felt most keenly in scenes that deal with Shepard's younger brother, Logan, who adored him.\u00a0 Without putting too fine a point on it, the film also asks what it means to be truly Christian, as opposed to distorting Christianity as a cover for hate.\u00a0Concepts of\u00a0acceptance\u00a0(not \"tolerance\") and forgiveness are never far from its mind, and\u00a0these move into the foreground when Josue speaks to\u00a0Father Roger Schmit, who counseled one of Shepard's killers. Schmit tells her that forgiving those who've done wrong to us doesn't mean letting go of anger\u2014that righteous anger at injustice can be a force that gives shape to grief, and turns it into something positive, forward-thinking, healing. \u00a0It's overwhelming in the best way\u2014an observation so simple and profound that stops the film in its tracks. To her credit, Josue lets it stop, and just sits with Schmit's revelations for a while, and lets them sink into the movie, and our minds.\u00a0 The film's title reveals its world view, and its mission: not \"Matt Shepard was,\" but \"Matt Shepard is.\"", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Like Father, Like Son", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Too soon! Comma or not, the English-language title of Japanese writer/director Hirokazu Kore-eda often wrenching new family drama (winner of the Jury Prize at last year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival) bears too distinct a resemblance to the name of 1987\u2019s universally beloved Dudley Moore/Kirk Cameron starter. What\u2019s next, Japan? A movie whose title translates into \"Gone, With The Wind?\" Okay, that\u2019s enough out of me. But in all seriousness, the not inapt but too on-the-nose English language title of \"Soshite chichi ni naru\" (which, Google Translate tells me, works out to something like \"And I Will Be His Father\") is the worst thing about this movie. Kore-eda, whose pictures don\u2019t exactly alternate between soulful, understated fantastic fables (\"Afterlife,\" \"Air Doll\") and quiet family dramas (\"Still Walking\"), brings his trademark delicate but deliberate eye (and ear) to a really heartbreaking scenario. Six years into raising their only child Keita, whose birth left the young mother unable to have any more children, young couple Ryota and Midori are told that the child is not, in fact, theirs at all: that a hospital error switched two baby boys at birth. Soon the couple are meeting their biological child for the first time, along with the family that raised him.  Advertisement As would not be unexpected in a domestic melodrama, the two families could not be more different. While Ryota (Masaharu Fukuyama) is a cold-to-icy ambitious salaryman, next to whom Midori (Machiko Ono) sometimes looks resentfully dutiful, their biological son, named Ryusei, has been growing up with two young siblings, in a cozy raucous household whose tinkerer dad Yudai (Lily Franky) and ramen-restaurant-server mom Yukari (Yoko Maki) dote on their kids despite their limited means.  Initially the clash of classes seems a little schematic. The straightforward Yudai sees a big payoff from the hospital, while Ryota adopts an arguably fake-noble stance with his insistence that the money doesn\u2019t matter, that they have to come up with a plan for what\u2019s best for the kids. Obviously a swap has to be made, eventually. But is that conclusion really so obvious? In a series of beautifully calibrated scenes, Kore-eda explores not just the nature of parental love but of filial love, and as the painful alienated past of Ryota comes to light, his stiffness and lack of empathy become more comprehensible but no less kind of infuriating. It\u2019s a testimony to Fukuyama\u2019s acting skills that as pig-headedly alienating as the character can be, he never becomes a complete turn-off. That\u2019s also a testimony to the way Kore-eda presents the situation; while the perspective is never not clear-headed, the abject heartbreak of the scenario is ever present. (Imagine the way that a typical Hollywood film about this story would make a deliberate burlesque of it.) A second act plot twist of sorts doesn\u2019t just accelerate the dramatic momentum; it forces the characters to confront the uglier sides of themselves. Every now and then, Kore-eda will overplay his representations a little bit; there\u2019s a scene in which Ono\u2019s character contemplates an escape from the torment of potentially trading the son she loves for a child she doesn\u2019t know, biology or not; this takes place on a train, and as her thoughts grow darker, the shadows of the station that the train is pulling into throw her and the child actor into literal darkness. It\u2019s a well-orchestrated effect that hinges on obvious. On the other hand, I suspect the only reason it stands out is because most of the movie is so subtle and straightforward. While I\u2019m not a parent myself, I can see how \"Like Father, Like Son\" would be a tough sit for any parent. Tough, but extremely worthwhile.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Iron Man 3", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Shane Black, who made his bones writing \"Lethal Weapon,\" \"The Last Boy Scout\" and other crash-and-burn action films, was the perfect person to take on \"Iron Man 3,\" and not just because he worked with the franchise's star Robert Downey Jr. on 2005's \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.\" The new film's not great, but it's consistently involving because the tonal shifts are so abrupt. One minute it seems to care a great deal about what's happening, the next it's sneering at the notion that anyone could care about anything that happens in a movie.\u00a0 Advertisement For a franchise on the brink of fatigue, this attitude seems just about right \u2014 especially considering that all of the Iron Man movies are more self-aware comedies than dramas, with overlapping, often improvised-sounding dialogue and winks at the audience which suggest that the filmmakers are fans of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby's affable Road series. This is the kind of film in which the hero can swear revenge against the villain for injuring his friend, then a few scenes later earn big laughs from the sight of Tony Stark in Iron Man regalia tottering down narrow stone steps like a drunk drag queen in nosebleed heels. \"A girl and a couple of lame quips, that's all you got?\" a female assassin taunts Tony. \"Sweetheart,\" he replies, \"that's the title of my autobiography.\" Of course \"Iron Man 3,\" which pits Tony aganst an Osama bin Laden-style terrorist-guru known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), is a lot more brutal than the old Hope-Crosby pictures. In fact, its violence stretches the PG-13 rating to the breaking point, with lethal (if mostly bloodless) gunplay, and moments of wanton cruelty that would be jarring if the film weren't a cartoon fantasy in which pain and the laws of physics are largely theoretical. (As in his other screen appearances, Tony survives high falls and supernatural body-blows that would pulp a real person, but it's all of a piece with the film's dream logic.) The story reunites most of the recurring cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts (CEO of Stark Enterprises, and Tony's girlfriend), Don Cheadle's \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, aka War Machine (re-christened Iron Patriot, and enlisted in the ongoing War on Terror) and Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan, who's still guarding his quipster boss with big brotherly devotion. There are new gadgets, including a segmented \"prehensile\" Iron Man suit whose pieces are controlled via a receptor implanted in Tony's body and fly through the air, locking onto his arms and torso part-by-part. There's a love triangle \u2014 more of a tension triangle \u2014 involving Tony, Pepper and a supposed botanist named Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall). Advertisement And there's a mystery \u2014 or perhaps I should say \"mystery,\" since any sentient moviegoer will be able to guess how all the pieces lock together: Who is the Mandarin? What does he have to do with the dashing, charismatic entrepreneur-scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who wants to sell Stark Industries a metabolizing substance called Extremis, which can create new limbs and heal sick bodies, but has certain, er, side effects? How does Maya fit into all of this? Can the combined forces of the U.S. military and Stark Industries stop the Mandarin from bombing us into oblivion? Barring that, can they at least prevent him from simultaneously interrupting every broadcast in North America with his sermons on the moral failures of military-industrial capitalism? (His sentiments are warmed-over Noam Chomsky, but they're brilliantly edited, with flash-cuts of terrorists training and stuff blowing up. Unlike bin Laden, the Mandarin knows it's not enough to stand in front of a camera and rant; the images need to sizzle, baby!) Tony's adversaries are visually fresh, even though, with two notable exceptions, Black and his cowriter Drew Pearce haven't given them characters to play. They pass as regular people but can morph and re-form like the T-1000 in \"Terminator 2,\" their core substance looks more like molten lava than molten steel and their eyes glow a hellish crimson. During a fight with former Army-colonel-turned-Mandarin-henchman Eric Savin (James Badge Dale, chewing gum a lot) Tony mocks the bald, red-eyed assassin by calling him \"Westworld.\" Downey is as anti-sentimental and hilarious as ever \u2014 he's basically young Bob Hope with biceps -- but from certain angles he looks like a pumped-up Kevin Smith, and I found this distracting and eerie. As his best pal and partner in biomechanical heroics, Cheadle has an easygoing authority and matches Downey quip-for-quip and gunshot-for-gunshot, like last time. He could carry his own comic book picture easily, but if it were as inconsequential as most Marvel projects, I'm not convinced that would be a great use of his talents. Paltrow is tough and endearing when she's onscreen, which isn't often enough.\u00a0 Advertisement As the Osama bin Laden-esque villain the Mandarin, Ben Kingsley steals the movie, and I wish I could say precisely how without spoiling a wonderful surprise. Guy Pearce's torso, showcased shirtless in a fight scene, steals the movie right back. He must have spent six hours a day at the gym for months to look that ripped; you could grate lettuce on his abs. The compositions and editing are industry-standard, mostly loose and chaotic, and if you see the movie in 3D (actually post-converted 3D), you might have trouble telling exactly what's going on during the darker scenes, because the glasses dim the image so much.\u00a0 A couple of days after seeing the film, I can't recall a single beautiful or even memorable shot, though there's a skydiving action sequence two-thirds of the way through that's one of the greatest airborne setpieces in movie history. Given the amiable glop that surrounds it, I can't imagine how it found its way into the movie, though; most of the action isn't so much directed as covered, and its themes are articulated with about as much care. \"Iron Man 3\" builds on the first film's political cynicism by suggesting that politicians and arms dealers dream up foreign policy crises to consolidate power and make money, but it doesn't develop this notion in detail, because if it did, the audience would tune out. As in most comic book blockbusters, both the heroism and villainy are personal, good apples vs. bad apples, and the story's latent pacifism is eclipsed by the joy that Black takes in blowing things up and gunning people down. Hollywood alpha-male sleaze was an undercurrent in the first two films, manifesting itself through hot cars, glittering parties, and strip-club style booty shaking; \"Iron Man 3\" puts those same tendencies in the spotlight. Black's grinning machismo is a bro steroid, making creative muscles that were already well-defined balloon to grotesque proportions. This movie is the \"Entourage\" fantasy of Iron Man. Whenever a character barges into another character's bedroom, you're faintly surprised when there are only two people in the bed. One major character has a serious drug habit and the bad guys' relationship with Extremis has overtones of addiction as well.\u00a0 Advertisement Tony and Rhodey dominate the action and own the story; Pepper spends long stretches of the picture pinned inside what looks like a defective Nautilus machine, but at least she gets to banter with Tony first. Maya doesn't get to do much besides express remorse over her, um, connection to the mayhem, though she does have an unexpectedly touching conversation with Pepper that's filled with regret over bad roads she's taken. When Tony Stark's cliffside home is destroyed in a chopper attack \u2014 a moment prominently showcased in trailers \u2014 the audience gasps as if the film had shown a maniac slashing the Mona Lisa, and within this film's value framework, it does seem an obscenity. It's the greatest swinging bachelor pad ever put on film. \u00a0At long last, Mandarin, have you no decency? From his breakthrough as a screenwriter in \"Lethal Weapon\" to his directorial debut with 2005's \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,\" Black has carved out a niche as a borderline parodist of crash-and-burn action, serving up moldy macho clich\u00e9s while making fun of himself (and the audience) for loving them so much. The prototypical Shane Black hero shambles around presenting himself as a soul-dead cynic who's tired of the same old same old, but within an hour or so, he's rescuing people, swearing vengeance against evildoers, and sailing through the air unloading handguns. His stories straddle the midpoint of of the kidding/not kidding scale like a little kid standing atop a seesaw on the playground, shifting his weight around to make the opposing ends rise or fall.\u00a0 Along the way, Black sprinkles self-aware jokes about the rules and traditions of the genre as if he's Bertolt Brecht's meathead kid brother. Even his screenplays treat commercial screenwriting conventions as a big shared joke. \"Remember Jimmy's friend Henry, who we met briefly at the opening of the film?\" Black asks in the script for 1991's \"The Last Boy Scout.\" \"Of course you do, you're a highly paid script reader or development person.\" There's a brief subplot teaming Tony with a fatherless child that you half-expect will mutate into Daddy Issues sentimentality, but it doesn't, because Tony doesn't roll like that. Downey narrates the beginning and end of the picture. I wish Black had gone all-out and had him narrate the entire thing, a la \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,\" with asides into the camera: \"Hey, you know what I'm gonna invent next? A Hulk signal. The next film'll be 20 minutes long.\" Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}

The pacing isn\u2019t just clunky, it\u2019s edited in a way that almost feels designed to be distracting. The performances are uniformly bad, even from actors who normally do good work. It\u2019s one of those movies that's so inept on every level you almost want to recommend it. If you operate under the belief that you can learn as much, maybe even more, from bad movies as you can from good ones, this one is a master class in what not to do. Advertisement Perhaps the pain of \u201cAbattoir\u201d is magnified by the decent concept that is buried by the incompetent filmmaking. Jessica Lowndes plays Julia Talben, a real estate reporter whose family is brutally murdered by a sociopath. When she returns to the crime scene after the funeral with her cop friend Declan (Joe Anderson), she finds the room in which her loved ones were slaughtered has literally been ripped from the rest of the home. The two investigate further and the quest takes them into Julia\u2019s past, including the town in which she was born, where, shall we say, things aren\u2019t exactly normal. And a mysterious figure named Jebediah Crone (Dayton Callie) is building a home made entirely of rooms in which horror has ensued. If one unexpected death in a home creates a haunting, imagine what dozens would do. \u201cAbattoir\u201d is one of those films that\u2019s 90% exposition, which shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise coming from the man who directed three lesser \u201cSaw\u201d sequels, but it\u2019s still so depressing to watch a movie that needs character and atmosphere but offers only plot. Julia and Declan have to investigate the murder, then the room disappearance, then her past, then Jebediah, and so on and so on. It\u2019s little more than a series of exchanges about what they have just discovered, culminating in a sequence designed to be terrifying but is really more comforting because you know the movie is almost over. We\u2019ve reached the point in a review where one could go on and on about the inadequacies of this film, including its jarring tonal shifts, clich\u00e9d dialogue, etc. But perhaps it\u2019s easier to keep it short but bitter and leave it at this: perhaps it\u2019s untrue that something can be learned from every movie, even the bad ones. Perhaps some movies are so bad they only teach us that life is too short to waste on them.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Miracle Season", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "One of the most immediately noteworthy things about this movie is how clean everybody and everything in it is. \u201cThe Miracle Season\u201d opens with voiceover from Kelly (Erin Moriarty), telling the audience about how amazing it is to find a friend who makes you believe you can fly. Kelly and said friend, Caroline (Danika Yarosh) are seen as little girls and then teens, goofing around in a slightly converted barn that has nary a dust mote floating in it. Soon we\u2019re tooling around with teens Kelly and \u201cLine\u201d (that\u2019s Caroline\u2019s nickname) in a spotless sea-blue convertible; the girls are dressed in immaculate jerseys and shorts; they park outside a bakery and even the early autumn leaves on the sidewalk look as if they\u2019ve been freshly rinsed and meticulously placed. Stars Hollow looks like a neighborhood from a particularly grungy \u201cLaw and Order: SVU\u201d episode by comparison. And West High School, where the girls play volleyball, makes the high school in \u201cLove, Simon\u201d look like the one from \u201cThe Blackboard Jungle.\u201d Advertisement Caroline and Kelly themselves are similarly well-scrubbed. Line is very lively but wholesome; her mischievous streak is never malicious but aims to push her friends to do things they might never have tried. As when she pushed Kelly to invite a handsome new neighbor to the season kickoff party at the dust-free barn Line\u2019s dad owns, or when she impulsively challenges her teammates to partake in a pizza-eating contest, which move doesn\u2019t sit well with her no-nonsense volleyball coach, Kathy Bresnahan, played by Helen Hunt. Coach Bresnahan is particularly irked because her team was the state champion of 2010, and \u201cBres,\u201d as her charges call her, doesn\u2019t want that to be a fluke.    The reason the movie\u2019s set in 2010 is because it\u2019s based on a true story, and the true story gets rolling with a tragedy: Caroline\u2019s death in a driving accident just as the season\u2019s getting underway. The movie\u2019s particular cushy sheen, engineered by director Sean McNamara, means that of course the accident is not depicted. But Caroline\u2019s character has been well enough embodied by Yarosh\u2019s performance that the loss registers, and the devastation of her teammates, not to mention her surgeon father, played by William Hurt, is felt.    To a certain extent. Given the title, you know that this movie is not selling suspense but inspiration. The dispirited team can\u2019t shake off the loss at first, but thanks to an example reluctantly set by Kelly, it starts to find its footing again. The determination to win \u201cfor Line\u201d pushes everyone, until the coach asks the near-impossible: that the team clear the board and get to the quarter-finals by taking fourteen games in a row.    I imagine it\u2019s hard to simulate volleyball games, and I don\u2019t have to imagine in order to remark that they are difficult to make exciting on film. So this movie goes for the heartstrings and tear ducts more than the sports-conscious. The results are pretty mixed. God bless William Hurt. The script gives him every excuse to phone in the part of Caroline\u2019s father by obliging him to speak lines like \u201cI may be the surgeon, but you\u2019re the hero out there.\u201d Despite that, he\u2019s straight and genuine throughout. As is Hunt, whose character\u2019s emotionally shut-down fa\u00e7ade gives way in a powerful scene near the end.    Problem is, every time the movie gets near an authentic emotion, it barely pauses before making a run to the next Katy Perry song cue. (Seriously, both \u201cRoar\u201d and \u201cFirework\u201d are featured herein.) Given the care that the adult and teen actors invested in trying to honor their real-life counterparts, this feels lazy. If you like Katy Perry songs that much, you may feel differently.\u00a0  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Literally, Right Before Aaron", "Stars": 0.0, "Review": "Justin Long plays a fellow named Adam in \u201cLiterally, Right Before Aaron,\u201d a movie whose title allusion is explained about 30 minutes in. Aaron is the man marrying Adam\u2019s lovely ex-girlfriend Allison, played by Cobie Smulders, and Adam dated her literally right before. This is something of an issue for Adam. The movie opens with Adam getting the invitation to the wedding, by phone. Right away we can tell his relationship with Allison was special, because he has brief flashbacks of her face, and the shots all have lens flares in them, and they all look like low-rent ripoffs of similar frames from the Spike Jonze movie \u201cHer,\u201d specifically the parts where Joaquin Phoenix is getting all moony remembering Rooney Mara. So the wedding invite sets him askew. He goes out with work pals Mark (John Cho) and Claire (Charlyne Yi)\u2014did I mention that Adam works in the movie business, or its periphery, editing a nature show for a pompous fake zoologist played by Peter Gallagher?\u2014and he mopes throughout. \u201cDude. Just bowl. You\u2019re being a douche,\u201d Charlotte tells him. And honestly, writer/director/editor/composer Ryan Eggold, best known for acting on the television show \u201cThe Blacklist,\u201d could have ended the movie right there, because what we\u2019ve got for the next 30\u00a0minutes is, well, Adam being a douche.    Advertisement Adam then proposes impulsively to a glossy high-profile girlfriend, whose particular glossiness definitively tags her as Not The One. As she\u2019s about to accept, he blurts, \u201cI think we should break up.\u201d She exclaims, with absolute justification, \u201cYou are an a**hole. An A**HOLE.\u201d Storming out of the restaurant, she adds, \u201cYou are going to die alone.\u201d Again, this would have made a good ending to the movie. But no. Instead we get an hour-and-a-half of Adam brooding and reminiscing on his shared past with Allison, including their ostensible \u201cmeet-cute.\u201d This is really good. He approaches her in the college library while she\u2019s sitting among the stacks reading Of Mice and Men. He says to her, \u201cDo you want to get a coffee, or a juice, or a soda ...\u00a0\u201d She replies, \u201cI\u2019m reading my book.\u201d    And he tells her the book\u2019s ending. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re charming or just an a**hole,\u201d she says. I don\u2019t know about you, lady, but I had a pretty good idea during the bowling scene.    Of course, maybe Allison isn\u2019t so delightful either. There\u2019s one restaurant scene flashback that\u2019s meant to evoke \u201cAnnie Hall.\u201d Now, only the intent is evident; the evocation itself doesn\u2019t really take. The couple is trying to out-gross-out each other by concocting imaginary crimes against their fellow restaurant patrons. The scenario Allison proposes ends, \u201cand he dies \u2026 alone \u2026 of AIDS.\u201d Cute.\u00a0    Back in the present tense, Adam heads to San Francisco to attend the wedding. He accepts an invitation from groom Aaron to play tennis, even though he is incapable of playing tennis. He gets drunk at the wedding and dances like a jerk; he tells a nine-year-old boy to \u201ccall me when you\u2019ve got some hair on your balls\u201d; he does some indirect looks-shaming of a character played by Kristen Schaal, and much, much more.    It\u2019s painful to watch. Not because no one cares about Adam\u2019s heartache. But because the movie is boring, trite, sexist tripe that wants to make the viewer empathize with a guy who\u2019s actually pretty aggressive in his pursuit of loserdom. The only achievement Adam seems to have ever racked up in life was in dating Allison, who looks like Cobie Smulders and makes AIDS jokes. And Adam managed to screw that up, and I should care \u2026 why? Because Justin Long has a pleasant face? IT\u2019S NOT PLEASANT ENOUGH. Near the end of the movie, Adam defends himself. \u201cAmbush? This isn\u2019t an ambush,\u201d he says to Allison after accosting her in the ladies room at the wedding. Saying this, he\u2019s poking his finger at her in a way that comes close to actual assault. If one of those digits actually lands on her clavicle, it\u2019s going to leave a bruise.\u00a0 Advertisement There\u2019s a phrase circulating in contemporary cultural discourse: \u201cmediocre white men.\u201d As a white man who grapples a lot with insecurity and other roiling ups and downs of self-worth even at an advanced age, it\u2019s a group of words that sometimes makes me tetchy. Having watched \u201cLiterally, Right Before Aaron,\u201d though, I have a new understanding and appreciation for the term.

{"Title": "Counting", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In his masterful \u201cMuseum Hours,\u201d filmmaker Jem Cohen merged his skills as an urban documentarian with a narrative about two unlikely\r\nfriends. Art, history, companionship, support and everyday life merged into one\r\nvision. His latest, \u201cCounting,\u201d billed as a \u201cA film in 15 Chapters,\u201d is both\r\nmore ambitious and less purposeful in its intent. Clearly designed as a nod to\r\nChris Marker (particularly \u201cSans Soleil\u201d), \u201cCounting\u201d captures life around the\r\nworld in all its simplicity and diversity, as Cohen bounces back and forth from\r\nNew York City to Russia to Turkey, and locales in between. There\u2019s little\r\nnarration, little noise at all outside of the hum of traffic or the whine of a\r\ntrain or the rustle of leaves. Most people in frame are seen from behind, or\r\nvia reflection, or from a distance. And there are cats. Everywhere. Cohen isn\u2019t\r\nas interested in faces as he is urban tableaus. The result is a challenging\r\nwork that can be both exhilarating and grueling in its deliberate pace. Cohen\r\nis an undeniably gifted filmmaker, even if the sum total of this piece isn\u2019t\r\nquite as interesting as its parts. Advertisement \u201cCounting\u201d opens in New York City, featuring footage that\r\nthe filmmaker captured around the city from 2012 to 2014. The first segment of \u201cCounting,\u201d\r\nwhich I believe is also its longest, is arguably its best as it\u2019s a fantastic\r\ndisplay of Cohen\u2019s skills. He can turn the mundane imagery of urban existence\r\ninto art by the way it\u2019s shot, scored, or juxtaposed with another image. What\r\ncaptures his eye and the way he weaves into a piece can often result in great\r\nart. In the first segment, we hear a speech about discovering the secrets of\r\nthe universe while we view a sedentary homeless person. We see a torn page with\r\na headline about \u201cThe World\u2019s Last Mysteries.\u201d Cohen is placing imagery and\r\naudio of the questions of the universe against reflections of travelers on a\r\ntrain or a homeless man crossing the street. This is daily life and the world\u2019s\r\ngreatest mysteries are contained within it. Cohen has a remarkable ability to go from placid, almost\r\nsoothing imagery to kinetic, more frantic footage like when he captures an \u201cI\r\nCan\u2019t Breathe\u201d protest scored to discordant, loud music. Even flags waving in\r\nthe wind at a car dealership look antagonistic. He\u2019s playing with the essence\r\nof filmmaking here, knowing that the images just before and after those flags,\r\nalong with the choice of audio, change the way the viewer responds to them.  Sometimes Cohen can be straightforward and even didactic,\r\nsuch as in chapter 7, in which he presents imagery of reflections of people on\r\ntheir phones accompanied by audio of testimony about the NSA wiretapping.\r\nAlthough even this \u201cshort film within the big film\u201d feels contextually resonant\r\nwithin a piece that feels, at least to me, about interconnectivity and\r\ncommonality. Cohen jumps around the world and finds numerous images that look\r\nlike reflections of each other. People crossing squares in New York City and\r\nSt. Petersburg become often indistinguishable. Some of his compositions are\r\npicture-postcard beautiful while others take a minute to even discern what it\r\nis being displayed. And he\u2019s obsessed with travel and motion. A voice sings in\r\none chapter, \u201cDo you ever wonder where it\r\nis you\u2019re wandering?\u201d We\u2019re all wanderers around this world that\u2019s more\r\nsimilar than we even know. There are times, many times actually, when \u201cCounting\u201d feels\r\na bit too self-indulgent, something that never struck me during \u201cMuseum Hours,\u201d\r\nan undeniably more accessible piece for the average filmgoer. It starts to get\r\na bit exhausting and unfocused. Unpacking \u201cCounting\u201d can be difficult, and it\r\nfeels at times like it\u2019s purposefully so, as if Cohen is challenging\r\ntraditional expectations of film analysis, even ones as often abstract as his.\r\nBut one cannot deny the ambition of \u201cCounting,\u201d a movie that travels the world,\r\nconnecting it through the commonality of both everyday behavior and the\r\nuniversal language of cinema. \u201cCounting\u201d ends almost peacefully, with images of calm and\r\nnight. I was hoping for a bit more cumulative power, something to tie these\r\nchapters together, but I think Cohen purposefully avoids those kind of easy\r\ncinematic answers. Maybe these are just images, people and places around the\r\nworld that he found interesting. Perhaps you will too. And sometimes life is as\r\nsimple as that. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "10 Cloverfield Lane", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Warning: As you may have guessed by its stealth production\r\n(no one really knew it existed before a trailer dropped), the less you know\r\nabout Dan Trachtenberg\u2019s \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d the better. It is a film that\r\nplays on forced perspective, keeping you in the dark about what exactly is\r\ngoing on. I will tread very lightly in the review to follow, but I won\u2019t be\r\nhurt if you want to click away right about now. Come back after you've seen it. \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d is a tight, tense thriller carried by\r\nexcellent performances from John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. It has\r\nechoes of Alfred Hitchcock and H.G. Wells embedded in a cat-and-mouse game\r\nafter the end of the world. Without directly acknowledging it in traditional\r\nblockbuster ways, it\u2019s a sequel to 2008\u2019s \u201cCloverfield,\u201d a found footage film\r\nabout an alien invasion. It\u2019s almost like a spin-off from that film, imagining\r\na different story taking place in a different part of the world but in the same\r\nuniverse. Whereas that movie jumped on a current trend in its approach (found\r\nfootage), Dan Trachtenberg\u2019s film feels much more old-fashioned in its style,\r\nrecalling genre pictures of the \u201850s and \u201860s. Trachtenberg and his team don\u2019t\r\nexplore some of the film\u2019s potential themes as deeply as I hoped they would and\r\nit\u2019s less visually engaging than it could have been. But this is rock-solid\r\nentertainment, a film meant to keep you guessing and jumping for 100 minutes\r\nbefore it throws you back into the world to argue about its ending. Advertisement Once in development under the name \u201cThe Cellar,\u201d the script\r\nby Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken (with a co-story credit by \u201cWhiplash\u201d\r\nwriter Damien Chazelle) was retrofitted to place it in the world of \u201cCloverfield.\u201d\r\nSo, as Michelle (Winstead) drives away from her life and partner, leaving her\r\nhouse keys and ring on the table, we hear ominous reports of power outages on\r\nthe coast over the radio. These opening scenes are clearly designed to be\r\nreminiscent of another story of a woman who left the city for a dangerous\r\ncountryside, as Michelle packing her bags and Bear McCreary\u2019s overheated,\r\nHermann-esque score will make anyone who\u2019s seen \"Psycho\" think of Marion Crane in the\r\nopening act of Hitchcock's classic. It\u2019s not long before Michelle finds her Norman Bates. After a terrifying car accident, Michelle wakes up in a\r\nbarren room, chained to the wall. She soon meets her captor, an imposing figure\r\nnamed Howard (John Goodman), although he claims to be more of a savior than a\r\nkidnapper. He saw Michelle\u2019s accident just as the sky exploded. There\u2019s been an\r\n\u201cevent\u201d outside, and he grabbed Michelle just in time to get her into the\r\nbunker he built for just such an occasion. It could be the Russians, the North\r\nKoreans or the Martians\u2014but, whatever it is, the air probably won\u2019t be\r\nbreathable for one or two years. And isn\u2019t Michelle lucky that they have enough\r\nfood, filtered air, and other supplies in this doomsday prepper\u2019s bunker to\r\nwait it out? They\u2019re not alone. Just before Howard closed the door, a\r\nneighbor named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) barged his way in as well. Emmett,\r\nwho has seen Howard building this bunker for just such an occasion, confirms\r\nenough of what Howard says that Michelle starts to believe. Well-played by the \"Short Term 12\" star, Emmett becomes a pivot point for the film, alternating between encouraging Michelle's fears and affirming that Howard is, at least in part, who he says he is. And when she sees\r\nsomething horrible after an aborted escape attempt, she resigns herself to the\r\nidea that these two men will be the last human beings she ever sees. But\r\nsomething\u2019s not right with Howard. He\u2019s controlling to an uncomfortable level,\r\nespecially when it comes to the dynamic between Michelle and Emmett. There\u2019s a\r\nfantastic scene of game-playing in which Howard\u2019s misogyny is laid on the\r\ntable, and the film keeps us guessing as to just what his intentions or end\r\ngame will be.  Advertisement That sense of unease is certainly there in the script and\r\nTrachtenberg deserves credit as well, but it\u2019s John Goodman\u2019s performance that makes\r\nyour skin crawl. He captures a man on the edge of sanity for whom control is\r\nkey. He\u2019s not an obvious maniac, as some other actors would have played the\r\nrole, but someone who honestly thinks he\u2019s a savior, and thinking that plays\r\ninto his control-freak God complex. Goodman keeps us guessing, allowing\r\nglimpses of the possibly kind man that Howard used to be before all of this\r\nhappened but even shading those in a sense of conditionality. Howard reminds\r\nMichelle and Emmett that he saved them so much that we start to wonder what he\u2019s\r\ngoing to expect in return. In terms of performance, the underrated Winstead matches\r\nGoodman in every way. So fantastic in \u201cSmashed\u201d and \u201cFaults,\u201d this is an\r\nactress who only gets a small portion of the attention she deserves. She\r\ncarries \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d conveying Michelle\u2019s conflicted feelings about\r\nher predicament and staying so completely in the moment that the tension\r\nremains. We only know what she knows, so she has to be our conduit to the film,\r\nresponding to each new hurdle and conflict as we would.  The final half-hour of \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane\u201d is pretty much\r\ngoing to dominate the conversation around the film. Without spoiling anything,\r\nit\u2019s a series of events in which Michelle finds new challenges around every\r\ncorner (that would only be a spoiler if you\u2019ve never seen a thriller). While I\u2019m\r\nnot sure it\u2019s as narratively sound as it could have been\u2014and one can see the\r\nretrofitting of the traditional thriller into the sci-fi universe\u2014Winstead and\r\nthe filmmakers keep it working through sheer confidence. Like the opening\r\nscenes of the film, the final act is largely dialogue-free. There\u2019s none of\r\nthat character-talking-to-herself nonsense you see in lesser films that aren\u2019t\r\nas sure of themselves when it comes to visual storytelling. So many movies hold\r\nyour hand as you go over every hill on the rollercoaster.

If you\u2019re familiar with the work of Tony Jaa, and have followed his career trajectory, you may think you know the reason I\u2019m asking the above question. For those needing to get up to speed: Tony Jaa is a pretty incredible Thai martial arts dude. Not much of an actor, but certainly enough of an incredible Thai martial arts dude to conceive and perform in a series of staggering action sequences in latter-day martial arts classics such as \"Ong Bak: Muy Thai Warrior\" and its two sequels. He is also known for eschewing what the martial arts movie pros call \"wire work\" (no flying kicks for him) and reliance on CGI. A good old fashioned organic incredible martial arts dude, in other words.  Advertisement So Jaa fans may think I\u2019m asking why he\u2019s doing wire work and putting himself in the same frame with CGI effects in his new U.S. release \"The Protector 2,\" but that\u2019s not it. I\u2019m upset because he\u2019s doing such cheesy wire work, and because the CGI effects he\u2019s interacting with are so lame. I\u2019m upset because he\u2019s appearing in a movie that unnecessarily tricks up the admittedly no-big-thing but still amiable character dynamic of the 2005 \"The Protector\" (Thai country boy makes odd couple with cranky cop) by introducing a villain played by RZA, arguably a hip-hop genius but still The Worst Actor In The World (a title he clinched with 2012\u2019s \"The Man With The Iron Fists\"). I\u2019m upset because all of the bad acting and bad plotting actually ameliorate the impact of the action scenes. Think about how bad the acting and plotting have to be in order to distill the impact of a Tony Jaa battle scene. If you know a little about Tony Jaa, that\u2019s kind of hard to imagine. I know. But trust me. Or don\u2019t. The fact is this: if you\u2019re already a Tony Jaa fan, you\u2019re going to see \"The Protector 2\" anyway.

I blame RZA.\" If you\u2019re not a Tony Jaa fan, you should start with \"Ong Bak,\" then see everything else.

{"Title": "A Farewell to Fools", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "There's a moment in \"A Farewell to Fools\" that shimmers with possible greatness, a moment that is, sadly, far too brief. Gerard Depardieu plays Ipu, a Frenchman taken in by a kindly village in Romania following WWI, and he is a lumbering child-like giant who spends his days chopping wood and going fishing with a young boy who loves him. During one scene where he is invited to a fancy dinner, he says to one of the other guests present, \"How did I look when I was young?\" We bring our associations to everything we see in the cinema, and in that moment, our long associations with Depardieu, the international movie star, all of his great roles, come into play. He says the line with a wistfulness that threatens to overwhelm the film. For the most part, \"A Farewell to Fools\" rollicks along on its own bizarre and not successful path, comedic moments falling flat, emotional moments running shallow, but in that moment we can feel something else striving to break free.  Advertisement Much like Fellini's \"Amarcord\", \"A Farewell to Fools\" is a farcical coming-of-age story taking place under the shadow of a military occupation. Romania is overrun by Nazis, and while the Germans are universally hated, everyone races around in a manic state trying to please them. A German soldier had his throat cut in the fields outside of town, and the Nazi overlords tell the frightened populace of the village that unless someone comes forward to claim responsibility, ten of the village's leading citizens will be executed the following day. Harvey Keitel plays Father Johanis, the local priest who gathers together the ten leading citizens (the mayor, the notary, the sheriff) and these reprehensible folks cook up a plan to make Ipu confess to the murder, to sacrifice himself for the good of the town.  Ipu is a Quasimodo-type character, who lives in a garret, listening to a scratchy recording of \"The Marseilleise\" and dreaming of his glory days as a French soldier. Ipu is unaware that he is being set up as the fall guy. He trusts the people who have taken him in, failing to recognize cruelty when it is right in front of him. He is swayed by Father Johanis' descriptions of the hero's funeral he will be given and the huge gravestone with gold-plated letters they will place in the cemetery for him. Alex (Bogdan Iancu), the young boy who is Ipu's only friend, sees what is happening and can't stop it. Ipu, as played by Depardieu, staggers around in a filthy white shirt, playing war games with his young friend, haunted by fragmented memories of his own wartime experiences, and easily overwhelmed by smooth talkers like Father Johanis.  Directed by Bogdan Dreyer, and based on a novel by Romanian \r\nscreenwriter and author Titus Popovici, \"A Farewell to Fools\" wants to be a farce. It should be a farce. But farce is \r\ndifficult in any circumstance, and while \"A Farewell to Fools\" sometimes hits the right tone, it can't sustain it. In one wacky sequence, the only successful one in the film, Ipu, convinced to go along with Father Johanis' plan, asks that they do a rehearsal of his grand funeral, so that he can at least see what it will be like. The mock funeral, involving the whole town, is very funny, involving villagers stealing flags in the dead of night, under the noses of the Nazis, to wrap the body (\"No, not the swastika flag!\" hisses the mayor. \"The other flag!\"), Ipu sitting up in his coffin to listen to Father Johanis' sermon, and a procession to the cemetery with a marching band playing a happy tune. A sequence like that tells you to not take things too seriously, to laugh at these people, to laugh at the self-serious importance of charlatans like Father Johanis. Evil stalks the village, but it's more ridiculous than anything else. Advertisement  The film was shot in Romania, and Depardieu and Keitel are surrounded by a cast of Romanian actors. Keitel seems stiff and unsure of what film he is actually in, and the rest of the ensemble play their roles broadly, appropriate for farce but lost in the uneven tone of the whole. Romania's new wave is flourishing right now, with directors and producers and actors bringing forth dark, ironic, disturbing films detailing the chaos and problems inherent in the post-Ceau\u0219escu era. \"A Farewell to Fools\" is a strangely flat entry in that roll call, with that one gleaming wistful moment from Depardieu suggesting the film it could have been.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Bushwick", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "This movie will lose the goodwill of any longtime New Yorker watching it within the first ten minutes. Under the opening credits, there are a series of relatively pleasant helicopter views of Brooklyn, starting from the shores of Coney Island. But these grow more sinister as we note the presence of a machine-gun barrel in the bottom of the frame. Yikes. Then: cut to an underground subway station. Church Avenue, service by the G and F lines, as the visible signage shows. Lucy, played by Brittany Snow, is wending her way to the exit, with her milquetoast boyfriend, played by Some Dude\u2122. They\u2019re mildly concerned because there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone around but otherwise are feeling jokey about milquetoast boyfriend\u2019s impending introduction to Lucy\u2019s grandmother. Their reverie is interrupted by a screaming man, his body entirely on fire, running down from the subway\u2019s street level stairs.  Advertisement (Side note: I know that screaming-man-on-fire is a favorite shock effect of hack filmmakers the world over, but \u201cstop drop and roll\u201d is a real-life thing, unlike \u201cshooting zombies in the head is the only way to kill them,\u201d which is only a movie thing. Stop, drop and roll works. I once set my entire forearm on fire in a lighter fluid mishap, and I stopped, dropped and rolled instinctually, and it worked! Why don\u2019t more movie characters try this?) Now sensible people might react to this sight by going back down to the track level and getting the next train to somewhere else, but Lucy and milquetoast boyfriend have to check out the situation, because apparently Grandma is hung up on punctuality. No sooner does milquetoast boyfriend get to the sidewalk than he too is incinerated. Lucy, whose grandmother must be really very strict, goes to the sidewalk anyway, to see an overturned flaming Mr. Softee truck, and varied parties shooting and blowing stuff up.  So she runs, and is pursued into a basement by two street menaces. One is white, or white-ish, while the other is black. For balance. Although the black one ends up being the more sexual-assault-menacing one. Interrupting this unsavory bit of race-baiting is Dave Bautista, an ex-Marine named \u201cStupe,\u201d who owns the basement in which the rape is considered. He dispatches the villains briskly, but he\u2019s not particularly friendly to Lucy, at least not at first.  As for the thing that will have New Yorkers checking out: When Lucy comes out of the subway station, she is indeed in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn; she runs past Jefferson Avenue\u2019s fabled Owl Juice Pub and other landmarks. Only problem is that the Church Avenue station from which she supposedly emerges isn\u2019t anywhere near Bushwick. Lucy later tells Stupe that she came in on the L train; as seen on the signage at the beginning of the movie, the Church Street station services the G and F. What\u2019s the big deal? Ask Martin Scorsese. He has recounted in several interviews how nuts it used to drive him, in old Hollywood movies, to see a couple turn a corner in Greenwich Village and wind up strolling down the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. But there\u2019s a deeper problem at work. Nick Damici and Graham Reznick, the screenwriters, seem to have based their portrayal of this transforming neighborhood in the county of Kings entirely on viewings of that old sensationalist TV cop drama \u201cBrooklyn South,\u201d which worried parents used to cite to their children when they wanted to dissuade them from moving to the borough.  Advertisement Additionally, they seem to have written their dialogue by typing out \u201cWe gotta get the f**k out of here!\u201d into their Final Draft document, copying that, and then pasting it onto each page, two or three times. For some reason they have crafted an inadvertently hilarious exchange between its two main characters: \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cHoboken.\u201d  Lucy is an entitled, petulant dolt whose most interesting trait is that she doesn\u2019t go into shock despite conditions that would put her there multiple times. Stupe is a stock Bautista type: taciturn, grunty, all that. He\u2019s an ex-Marine who\u2019s supposed to have Rambo-esque skills (and of course somebody makes a point of mentioning the Stallone character, for \u201cverisimilitude,\u201d I guess), but when he deigns to teach Lucy how to use a gun, he never shows her where the safety is.  The movie\u2019s main feature is a group of long-take, moving-camera action scenes that I guess might have been more engaging had the characters on the run and in battle been figures you wanted to spend any time with. They\u2019re not. These set pieces are either getting much easier to do, or they are the sole talent of co-directors Cary Murnion and Jonathan Milott, because the filmmakers distinguish themselves in precisely zero other ways. The obnoxious, opportunistic premise is a menace-from-within scenario that\u2019s laughable even in the wake of certain current events. The numbskull faux nihilism of the ending is possibly intended as a homage to a recently departed horror movie director, but it\u2019s more like a callow insult.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Affluenza", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "In 2014, teenage Ethan Crouch was given probation and mandatory treatment in a rehab facility for driving drunk and killing four people. He was given no jail time. The case made national news when a psychologist hired by the defense said that Crouch suffered from something called \"Affluenza,\" where poor little rich kids just have to run wild because their parents haven't set any limits. While the judge said that the \"Affluenza Defense\" carried no weight in her decision, there was a lot of worried commentary about the precedent such a defense might set, similar to the notorious \"Twinkie defense.\" That actually could make a semi-interesting story for a film. Unfortunately, Kevin Asch's second film, \"Affluenza,\" is not that story. A lukewarm attempt to portray the so-called affliction, set against the backdrop of the 2008 economic crash and President Obama's election, \"Affluenza\" thinks it is deep when it is merely trite. It illuminates nothing. Advertisement The situation is made more problematic by the clear nod to \"The Great Gatsby\" in its story particulars. \"Affluenza\" suffers constantly in comparison. Fisher Miller (Ben Rosenfield) takes the Nick Carraway role as a teenager from Ithaca, spending the summer with his rich stockbroker uncle Phil (Steve Guttenberg) on Great Neck, Long Island. Fisher, who is a photographer trying to get into art school, enters a world of lackadaisical teenage corruption and boredom, but he finds easy entry into that world by dealing drugs. Phil is married to Bunny (Samantha Mathis), and they have a teenage daughter, Kate (Nicola Peltz). Kate spends most of her days either sunning by the pool or shopping. Women in this world are beautiful useless baubles, supported by the money their men make on Wall Street. Fisher befriends a rich kid named Dylan (Gregg Sulkin), the Jay Gatsby stand-in, who lolls about like James Spader in \"Pretty in Pink,\" in tennis whites &\u00a0sunglasses, and is neglected by his rich father. Dylan has fallen madly in love with Kate and begs Fisher's help to \"win her heart\", and then, in a completely unconvincing scene, he stands underneath Kate's window calling her name in agony, a la Stanley Kowalski. These people don't make any sense. Perhaps that is supposed to be the point, but Antonio Macia's screenplay is unable to get beneath the surface of these people and\u00a0their circumstances. It's simplistic and condescending. People stand around and state who they are, clearly. The first time we meet Uncle Phil, he says to his nephew: \"Art school - la la la, you should go to business school.\" One hot-shot guy on the golf course happens to be overheard saying, \"Let's cruise the town in my new Aston Martin and check out the tail.\" Fisher is supposed to be the naive interloper in a sophisticated world about to collapse. Everyone sits around watching Obama's campaign speeches on television with a visible lack of interest. Even the news of the national financial situation doesn't seem to register until it's too late. Only in the performance of Steve Guttenberg do we get a sense of the real stakes for these people. There is a terrific confrontation scene near the end of the film between Guttenberg and Mathis, that is vicious, violent, and undercut by sheer terror that their privileged existence has been destroyed in one fell swoop. That scene is so good, and it's the only one. The young cast seems pretty lost, unaware of the deeper implications of the story, and unable to fulfill the obligations in the script with any sense of coherency. Dylan could be a fascinating character, a broken and shallow kid, who has never had to work on getting a personality, or creating anything for himself. Instead, he remains an insipid caricature. Advertisement Some of the scenes are filmed from a slight distance, important scenes, and the distance ends up muting the urgency of whatever might have been happening. The energy that may exist between the actors is lost in that intervening space. Fisher is, supposedly, from a more modest background, and yet the entitlement around him has affected him so much that at one point he murmurs, \"I'm gonna have to get a part-time job at some point,\" as though that idea is completely revolutionary. Macia also saddles him with terrible lines such as: \"What's the point of making all that money if you can't connect to the people that you love?\" One yearns for Gatsby's green light across the bay after listening to dialogue like that.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Final Portrait", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The writer James Lord was a chronicler of 20th\u00a0century art who not infrequently befriended the artists he wrote about. In 1964, in Paris, the sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti asked Lord to sit for a portrait. What the artist had originally pitched as a day\u2019s work wound up taking almost three weeks. Not an eternity by any stretch of the imagination, but an inconvenience, and a meaty experience, one out of which Lord forged a memoir entitled \u201cA Giacometti Portrait.\u201d \u201cFinal Portrait\u201d is\u00a0an adaptation of that memoir written and directed by Stanley Tucci. Like a couple of other directorial efforts from Tucci, who\u2019s primarily known as an actor, this is a picture about process. His 1996 \u201cBig Night\u201d is the story of the making of an epic meal; 2000\u2019s \u201cJoe Gould\u2019s Secret\u201d is a dual portrait of two writers with very different approaches to work (and very different results).    Advertisement Giacometti, a self-described \u201cItalian Swiss\u201d now ensconced in a ramshackle mini-compound containing studio and living quarters in Paris, is played with shambolic gruffness by Geoffrey Rush. Armie Hammer\u2019s straight-standing, composed James Lord seems the artist\u2019s polar opposite, but the two have a kinship\u2014Lord has a deep understanding of Giacometti\u2019s artistic language.    Still, the artist\u2019s relentless self-doubt puzzles Lord. Lord protests that Giacometti\u2019s success ought to have erased that. Quite the contrary, the artist observes: \u201cWhat better breeding ground for self-doubt than success?\u201d The trappings of success mean little to him, either. He makes millions of francs in sales, but almost literally throws it away; what he doesn\u2019t, he hides in various nook of his studio.    As Alberto begins, erases, and again begins the portrait, James interrogates not just the artist but his brother and assistant Diego (Tony Shalhoub), his dutiful, very drawn-looking wife Annette (Sylvie Testud). Another presence is Caroline (Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy), a local prostitute with whom the artist is highly invested, to the point of buying her a sporty new BMW.    The movie is a minimally lovely treat to look at. Tucci and cinematographer Danny Cohen desaturate the colors at the beginning, giving the movie a black-and-slate-gray look from which blues and reds try to fight their way into the viewer\u2019s perception. The evening scenes, many of them spent at Giacometti\u2019s local, Caf\u00e9 Adrien, have a golden warmth. The mobile camera, which on occasion becomes a trifle too shaky, negotiates the artist\u2019s studio with a crafty curiosity.    This movie is a chamber piece, and even at its modest 90-minute running time, it gets a trifle repetitious\u2014Alberto picks up the brush again, James sits down, the camera produces a series of extreme close-ups of James\u2019 face (it\u2019s the head that the artist has the most trouble with). It\u2019s a nice face, with excellent pores, but, you know. Still, the depictions of artistic struggle and mania, the communication of the artist\u2019s frequently painful bubble, are insightful and rewarding. The warts-and-all depiction of Giacometti, which establishes a credible explanation if not excuse for the many selfish acts he\u2019s seen doing, winds up being an apt tribute to both the artist and art itself.\u00a0  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}

Spunky sweet, and smart Amber (Elizabeth Roberts) runs\r\nout of gas in the middle of a picture-perfect town in which Clay (Swartzwelder)\r\nhones various crafts at an antique store called, yep, \u201cOld Fashioned.\u201d Amber\u2019s\r\nresolve, such as it was, was to drive until she ran out of gas and set up\r\nhousekeeping wherever that happened to be. Clay helps her set up in a new\r\nquaintly furnished apartment but won\u2019t go through the screen door outside. He\r\nhas made a vow, he tells Amber: he won\u2019t be alone in a room with a woman who\r\nisn\u2019t his wife. Amber finds this odd. She finds it odder when she learns he\u2019s\r\nnot married.  Advertisement Clay\u2019s back-story is revealed in dribs and drabs: this is\r\nnot quite \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin\u201d played straight. The hero was not just a\r\ncollegiate ladies\u2019 man but a bit of a Joe Francis type as well, producing\r\nsalacious videos. Then he changed. \u201cYou found Jesus?\u201d Amber asks him. \u201cMore\r\nlike\u2026he found me,\u201d Clay responds. So, yes, this \u201cFifty Shades\u201d-counter-programming isn\u2019t\r\nkidding around about being counter-programming. But I would not necessarily\r\ncharacterize this effort as a \u201cChristian movie,\u201d not that there\u2019s anything\r\nwrong with that. Swartzwelder does a very thorough and not unbalanced job of\r\nportraying Christian characters trying to function in a social milieu that\r\ndiscourages values such as chastity, modesty, and so on. The movie tries hard\r\nnot to be overtly prudish about its point of view, and in many respects it\r\nsucceeds\u2014I didn\u2019t even notice until after it was over that it had no swearing\r\nin its dialogue. Once Clay explains his chaste theory of courtship to Amber,\r\nand Amber agrees to make a go of it, \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d also has no problem owning\r\nup to the fact that Clay\u2019s quest to be \u201ca decent person\u201d is in fact more than a\r\nlittle dogmatic. He\u2019s depicted as defensive and even a little hostile in terms\r\nof the ways he stands up for his beliefs. Amber\u2019s more conventionally\r\n\u201cfree-spirited,\u201d but within that context she\u2019s got more sense than Clay, as\r\ndoes Clay\u2019s adorable wise aunt Zella (Dorothy Silver). Near the climax of the\r\npicture, when Amber and Clay argue about the idea of forgiveness, Clay sniffs\r\n\u201cYou make it sound so easy,\u201d and Amber shoots him down good with \u201cYou make it\r\nsound impossible.\u201d It\u2019s incredibly rare to see an American movie with a\r\nChristian perspective that\u2019s more invested in philosophizing and empathizing\r\nthan in eschatological pandering, and for that alone \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d deserves\r\ncommendation. The movie\u2019s also very well acted and beautifully shot. However, Swartzwelder does tend to lay things on a little\r\nthick. There\u2019s a scene in which a character gets a poster for the Frank Capra\r\nfilm \u201cMeet John Doe\u201d as a present, which is all well and good, but then the\r\nviewer is subjected to a reprise of Gary Cooper\u2019s climactic speech at the end\r\nof the film along with a few sensitive dissolves of small-town-America imagery.\r\nOne of the jarring voices of modernity is a local radio DJ whose show\r\napparently consists entirely of misogynist rants; you know, most local radio\r\nstations, even the most talk-oriented, do provide weather reports every now and\r\nthen. I mentioned the cinematography before; it\u2019s by David George, and it\u2019s\r\nlovely, but every now and again Swartzwelder and his editors string together\r\nseveral of said images for interludes that could be characterized as\r\n\u201cMalick-lite.\u201d This speaks, finally, to the movie\u2019s most substantial flaw,\r\nwhich is that with respect to pacing, Swartzwelder, going for \u201cthoughtful,\u201d instead\r\nachieves \u201cglacial.\u201d A romance wants to sweep viewers up, not bog them down.\r\nStill, \u201cOld Fashioned\u201d is both unusual and intelligent enough that, despite it not being entirely MY cup of tea, I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019ll succeed at doing at\r\nleast a little more than addressing the converted.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "1922", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "2017 has truly been the year of Stephen King, but the last in a long line of films and TV shows is, in some ways, the most surprising. A remake of \u201cIt\u201d was inevitable, even if no one expected it to be the box office behemoth it became. \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d was in some state of pre-production for years, and Mike Flanagan personally brought his vision for \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d to the big/small screen of Netflix. On TV, \u201cThe Mist\u201d felt like an obvious choice in a post-\u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d world (and was truly awful) while the bestselling success of \u201cMr. Mercedes\u201d made that TV adaptation inevitable. Which brings us to \u201c1922,\u201d a 131-page novella contained in King\u2019s 2010 anthology Full Dark, No Stars. It\u2019s a decent piece of work, but not one that screams feature film, and the relative thinness of the source material hurts Zak Hilditch\u2019s film of the same name.\u00a0 Advertisement With leathered skin from working in the fields and a remarkable Southern drawl, Thomas Jane plays Wilfred James, a Nebraska farmer with a bitter wife named Arlette (Molly Parker) and a loyal son named Henry (Dylan Schmid). Arlette clearly dislikes life in the country and wants to sell her half of the farm to a local livestock company, but you can literally see Wilf\u2019s skin crawl when his wife dares mention moving to the city. That\u2019s for the dumb people, and the James family isn\u2019t dumb.    Wilf commits his first despicable act when he weaponizes his son\u2019s first love. Henry has fallen for a neighbor girl named Shannon Cotterie (Kaitlyn Bernard), and moving to the city will tear these young lovers apart. For reasons that aren\u2019t completely captured in a believable way, Wilfred decides that the only way to make this dilemma go away is for Arlette to die, and he convinces his son to help him. \u201c1922\u201d is told primarily in flashback, as a clearly-troubled Wilfred has come to a hotel room like the protagonist of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s The Tell-tale Heart, haunted by demons he himself created. So there\u2019s a sense that we\u2019re being told a story from an unreliable narrator, although not quite enough is made of that cinematically. No, for the most part, \u201c1922\u201d draws a straight line down a hill from a violent act to complete insanity, a not uncommon theme for King, who has long been fascinated by what happens when men choose murder over reason.    There is a very fine line between a film that burns slowly and one that just drags, and \u201c1922\u201d falls into the latter category a few too many times. The fact is that it\u2019s quite difficult to make a film about a man who may be going insane because you have to physically manifest what may just be the visions of a guilty man\u2019s conscience. To his credit, Thomas Jane does a marvelous job of conveying what\u2019s asked of him by material and filmmaker. At first, his slow drawl seemed a bit overdone, but the character work here is strong, especially as Wilf goes deeper and deeper over the edge of sanity. The problem is how little there is of interest here outside of Jane\u2019s work, which is again indicative of the issues with bringing a confessional novella to feature film form. The film isn't visually striking enough, the dialogue isn't memorable, and the message of the film is the relatively straightforward horror classic:\u00a0don't kill people. Some of the imagery contained in the\u00a0final half-hour of \u201c1922\u201d nearly justifies the journey to get there, I just couldn\u2019t help thinking that there\u2019s a tighter, more thrilling version of this story that runs much shorter, like an hour-long anthology horror series. Ultimately, it\u2019s the familiar case of a short story stretched too thin in a feature film, resulting in what will likely be the least-remembered project from 2017: The Year of King.

That\u2019s a blanket statement, but nothing that came out of the multiplex this summer contradicts it.\" Burr acknowledges that there was a lot to see in the arthouses, but if you only judge the state of the industry on the quality of summer tentpole blockbusters, then yes, movies may seem to be in a very sorry state. But open the lens up a little wider, and there is an entire galaxy of stuff going on\u2014challenging/complex films (where the flaws are more interesting than anything you'd see in a more risk-averse film), first features, foreign films, microbudget films with unknown actors, films doing what films\u2014at their best\u2014have always done. Outside of mainstream Hollywood, 2016 has been a tremendous year, with films like \"The Witch,\" \"Cemetery of Splendour,\" \"Krisha,\" \"The Fits,\" \"Everybody Wants Some!!\", \"The Hunt for the Wilderpeople,\" \"The Nice Guys,\" \"Disorder\" (the list goes on) ... You don't even have to go far off the beaten track to find an entire landscape of interesting stories told in unique ways.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Kicks,\" director Justin Tipping's feature debut\u2014the story of a teenage boy attempting to get back the sneakers stolen from him\u2014is one of those special films. \"Kicks\" is not without its flaws, but even the flaws show Tipping's willingness to take risks, to go for the big gesture and to go for it honestly. \"Kicks\" is a coming-of-age story with many nostalgic callbacks to other films, but it takes place in its own environment, upending the suburban cliche. \"Kicks\" is knowing and innocent, profound and goofy.\u00a0 Tipping grew up in the East Bay area of Oakland, and understands first-hand the teenage Cult of Sneakers, sneakers that create and affirm social status, sneakers as powerful signifiers. (Those who judge \"bling\" and \"conspicuous consumption\" probably have never wanted for anything in their lives.) Sneakers send a message: \"I am somebody.\" Sneakers also make you vulnerable to those who want what you have. There are sections of \"Kicks\" that are surreal and dreamlike, where time slows way, way down, and other sequences where the jagged reality of life in the neighborhood is palpable. Tipping and cinematographer Michael Ragen create a subjective and poetic mood from the very first shot, a mood that serves the film\u2014and its pure emotionalism\u2014very well. The point of view is always clear: This is the world as seen by 15-year-old Brandon (Jahking Guillory), smaller in size than most of his classmates, who wishes he was taller, bigger, but most of all wishes he had a great pair of sneakers, specifically the magnificent black and red Air Jordans he sees on another boy's feet in the hallway at school.\u00a0 Brandon hangs around with his two best friends, ladies' man Rico (Christopher Meyer) and wannabe ladies' man Albert (Notorious B.I.G.'s son, Christopher Jordan Wallace). There are no parental figures in sight. The three young actors have an unforced chemistry with one another, with a very real affection behind it. Each character has quirks that annoy the others (Albert ostentatiously buys extra-large condoms as Rico and Brandon roll their eyes at each other; Albert has never had a girlfriend in his life), but they have one another's backs. Their group dynamic is the glue of the film, and also provides necessary comic relief when things get grim. Brandon saves his money and finally buys an impressive pair of Jordans from a guy selling them out of the back of his truck. Brandon struts out of the house wearing them, like Tony Manero in \"Saturday\u00a0Night Fever,\" only to get jumped soon after by a gang led by the notorious silver-toothed Flaco (Kofi Siriboe), who steals Brandon's sneakers right off of his feet. Brandon ropes in his reluctant goofball buddies to join him in his quest to get his sneakers back. Advertisement Getting the sneakers back takes them to many wild and unfamiliar places (namely, Oakland), where the boys meet up with Brandon's terrifying and yet wise ex-con Uncle Marlon (Mahershala Ali, in a brilliant Mariana-Trench-deep performance), and Brandon's two stoner cousins, willing to help out their much-younger relative. Flaco is such bad news that everybody warns Brandon off, tells him to let the sneakers go, but Brandon declares, \"They're not just shoes. They're fucking J's.\" Nobody really can argue with that. Once in Oakland, the boys plunge into a whirlwind, funny and scary and confusing. One of the strongest elements of the script (co-written by Tipping and Joshua Beirne-Golden) is that Flaco ends up having complexity of his own because Tipping doesn't just follow Brandon, he also follows the sneakers: we see where Flaco puts them, we see who Flaco gives them to. This choice gives \"Kicks\" an undercurrent of thought-provoking ambivalence.\u00a0 The film opens with Brandon admitting in voiceoever that he has always dreamt of going into space, where it is quiet, where no one can mess with you. He dreams of a \"spaceman\" companion, a guardian angel astronaut who floats down into the middle of scenes, hovering over the streets, appearing at Brandon's side, encouraging Brandon silently, or just standing watch over his charge. Brandon's wishes for himself\u2014freedom, quiet, to be left alone\u2014is almost as strong as his wish for cool sneakers. Tipping picks and chooses the astronaut appearances very carefully, and so when the spaceman does appear it's not a gimmick or a device. It's the whole point. The astronaut, with mirrored helmet, hovers over the chaos, beckoning Brandon down this or that path. Sometimes the astronaut urges some pretty sketchy choices, but that's evidence that Brandon is, after all, only 15 years old. He wants to fit in, he also wants to be his own person. How do you reconcile those two things? The adolescent conundrum. At a certain point along the journey, Brandon steals a gun, in case he needs it for later. The Chekhov's gun plot point is not a fatal flaw, but it is a flaw. So much of \"Kicks\" ricochets along on its own energy, from hallucinations to chase scenes, to party scenes, to group conversations. The gun comes from a less imaginative, less personal movie, and the tension it generates is empty. But the weird thing about a flaw in a movie like \"Kicks,\" is that it highlights just how good, how strong, the rest of it really is. Elia Kazan talked and wrote constantly about the \"spine\" of his films, and how that spine had to be evident in every scene, every character, every moment. Once he understood the spine, it led him to the artistic choices he made. It takes an extremely clear vision to pull that off, and Tipping has that clear vision. This is a beautiful film and a major directorial debut. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Sausage Party", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "This relentlessly scabrous cartoon comedy\u2014which, by the way, to anyone old enough to remember Ralph Bakshi, is not a \u201cfirst\u201d of any kind, not by a long shot\u2014opens with a view of an empty parking lot with an arc-roofed mega-market in the background. Inside, the corn, the fruit, the condiments and especially the hot dogs and their neighboring buns, packaged for Fourth of July sales, sing a silly hymn about their hopes for being \u201cchosen\u201d by the \u201cGods\u201d who will deliver them to \u201cthe Great Beyond.\u201d\u00a0 \n \u201cOh dear,\u201d I thought. \u201cDo Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg want to be Trey Parker and Matt Stone now?\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement \n Not really, it turns out\u2014that song\u2019s the only original in the movie. But given that the hot dogs and the buns then engage in an exchange of dirty talk that makes Cartman in \u201cSouth Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut\u201d sound like Joel Osteen, \u201cSausage Party,\u201d directed by Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon from a script by Rogen, Goldberg, Ariel Shaffir and Kyle Hunter, with a story credit going to voice actor and executive producer Jonah Hill is spectacularly relentless in its profanity and sex talk and extends the metaphor of anthropomorphic groceries into territory you and I might not have even imagined. To wit, the movie\u2019s villain, or rather, sole-non-human villain, is an extremely irate feminine hygiene product voiced by Nick Kroll.\u00a0 \n Once in an interview the very humorous Kevin Smith said to me, \u201cComedy is so f**king subjective.\u201d I have to be honest here and say the comedy of \u201cSausage Party\u201d never really connected for me. I feel bad about this, because the voice cast contains not just super-talented actors but some friendly acquaintances who happen to be super-talented actors. \u201cMaybe I\u2019d like this if I still smoked weed,\u201d I thought at one point. The movie\u2019s prime mover, Rogen, is a doge of stoner humor, and he shows incredible discipline in this film by saving the first weed joke for twenty minutes in. I commend him for that. And I guess it\u2019s kind of funny that \"the imperishable\u201d\u2014three grocery items that let Rogen\u2019s frank Frank in on the fact that the Gods and the Great Beyond are just myths, and outside the supermarket there\u2019s only death and consumption\u2014get their buzz by smoking out of a kazoo. But I dunno. Even when I did smoke weed, it was never my favorite thing. And the allegorical structuring of the grocery community\u2014a nebbishy talking bagel and a goateed and belligerent piece of flatbread stand in for the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, for instance, and Nazi sauerkraut makes noises about eliminating \u201cthe Juice\u201d\u2014mostly struck me as an opportunistic ploy to get away with a lot of cruddy ethnic humor. The visual design of the picture was similarly crude and ugly, although the fact that one of the human characters looked as if he\u2019d stepped out of a Peter Bagge comic panel gave me intimations that something a little sharper overall could have been accomplished, if only \u2026 well, again I dunno.\u00a0 \n The movie picks up steam when a bunch of \u201cchosen\u201d franks meet their grisly fate\u2014all save one, the stunted Barry (Michael Cera) who escapes and finds himself in the clutches of a druggie who, upon injecting himself with cooked-down bath salts (no really) is able to see into the fourth dimension and realize his food has consciousness. This concern with \u201ctransdimensional metaphysics,\u201d as one of my colleagues called it in an after-screening discussion, removes the movie from the standard-issue-Bill-Maher-atheism direction I had thought it was going in. But again, I didn\u2019t quite buy it. I did a lot of drugs back in the day, but in my brief exploration of psychedelics I never had the epiphany that mass-produced comestibles had sentience. Maybe it was just bad luck on my part. Once, while tripping at a weekend party in Connecticut, I had intimations of the cosmic while watching deer ticks explode from the heat on the patio of the house where I was staying. But never a talking bag of potato chips.\u00a0 \n Anyway, this tack actually continues up until the film\u2019s d\u00e9nouement, the only portion of it to wrangle a chuckle out of me. Your mileage may vary, as they say. Also, hugs not drugs. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The novelty of \"found footage\" wore off almost immediately upon arrival, and yet the \"style\" persists, despite the fact (or maybe because of the fact) that it's tired and lazy. \"Found footage\" requires too much forgiveness on the part of the audience. If you find yourself thinking, as I did, during \"Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones\", the fifth installment in the wildly popular series of films, \"Why wouldn't he turn off the spotlight on his camera so as not to be detected by the hungry coven of witches looking to devour him?\" then you're dead in the water. And so is the film. Thankfully, the entertaining chemistry between the two young leads in \"Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones\" (Andrew Jacobs and Jorge Diaz), almost saves it.  Advertisement Evil spirits are up to their old tricks in \"The Marked Ones\", and this time the action takes place in Oxnard, California, in a working-class Latino neighborhood, a welcome change in style and feel from the other more generic suburban installments. Jesse (Jacobs) and Hector (Diaz) live in a crowded apartment complex, with multigenerational family members crowded into small rooms. Both have just graduated from high school and seem to have no plans, no jobs, no goals. The only thing they have any interest in is fooling around with their new video camera. At first, they just film each other doing dumb stunts involving laundry baskets and staircases. Hector draws a penis on Jesse's face while he sleeps. Hilarity ensues. They do shots of tequila with Jesse's feisty grandmother (Renee Victor). The only reason this banal footage has any entertainment value is because of the two actors. Their energy together feels unselfconscious; it doesn't feel like acting. They seem like real boys, real friends.  Soon, the boys become curious about Anna (Gloria Sandoval), a downstairs neighbor. Weird moaning sounds and bumps come up through the grate at night. The boys attach the camera to a wire, lower it through the grate, and, to their amazement, observe frumpy Anna, in the nude, painting a red circle on the stomach of a gorgeous naked woman. Again, the \"found footage\" trope requires that you turn off your brain that pesters you with questions such as, \"That apartment down there has four rooms. Why would those two naked ladies choose to stand in the exact spot where the camera can pick up the action through the grate?\" The fact that what the boys observe is disturbingly ritualistic is erased by the reality of the real live boobs on display down there.  The jokes stop when Anna turns up dead.  Naturally, the boys have to break into her apartment (now a crime scene) in the middle of the night to investigate. Because, of course. There are some legitimate scares, although most of them are of the \"It was just a cat!\" variety. Jesse and Hector loop in one of Jesse's cousins, Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh). The three kids discover, sitting around one of those old low-tech electronic Simon devices one night (a fun throwback detail), that the device appears to be tapped into the paranormal spirits, acting like a Ouija board, answering \"Yes\" or \"No\" questions, to the astonishment of the three kids huddled around Simon. But then things become more serious. Jesse has a mysterious bite on his arm. People disappear. And yet, again and again, they sneak into Anna's apartment to continue their filmed investigation.  Advertisement Christopher Landon, involved as a writer and producer of the other \"Paranormal Activity\" films, steps into the director's role for the first time, and it is to his credit that he lets the dynamic between Hector and Jesse be the film's anchor. The plot is a dime a dozen, handled better and scarier on any individual episode of \"Supernatural\". But Hector and Jesse are adorable goofball guides, whose shared response to a paranormal event involves them whispering \"What the f___\" at each other, punctuated by giggling and bong hits.  The final scene of \"The Marked Ones\" loops us back to the first film, in an eerie tesseract, leaving the way open for more installments. Found footage may not be here to stay, but it hasn't exited stage right just yet.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Entourage", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "By the bitter end of its eight-season run, HBO\u2019s \u201cEntourage\u201d\r\nhad twisted its own narrative to a degree that it was barely recognizable from\r\nthe beginning of the series. When it started, \u201cEntourage\u201d was the story of\r\nthree average guys and their decidedly not average best friend with the\r\nmovie-star good looks, trying to make it in the cutthroat world of Hollywood\r\nwith only their loyalty to each other and NYC roots to keep them above the\r\nspoiled fray. We could relate to Vinny, Eric, Johnny and Turtle. By the end,\r\nthe boys of \u201cEntourage\u201d were men, and they were the exact kind of narcissists\r\nthat the show felt like it mocked at the beginning. Success was the most\r\nimportant thing in their lives, and the show became little more than a story of\r\na dream fulfilled, despite the occasional laugh. It wasn\u2019t about the guy who\r\nwent to Hollywood and stayed himself, bro. It was about the guy who went to\r\nHollywood and slept with models, had all the new toys, won awards, etc., bro.  Advertisement Four years after \u201cEntourage\u201d went off the air (although it\r\nfeels much longer), creator Doug Ellin is back with the inevitable film version\r\nof his show, continuing the same tonal problems of the last few seasons of the program only in a longer, bigger, more misogynist form. Much like the series, even in its lowest\r\npoints, there are still a few laughs from the supporting cast, and Ellin paces\r\nthe piece well (it doesn\u2019t feel nearly as long as the neverending \u201cSex and the\r\nCity\u201d movies), but \u201cEntourage\u201d mistakenly keeps its characters floating in\r\nrarefied air, giving us no way to relate to them or care about them. Vinny and\r\nhis buddies have become easier to correlate with the Kardashians than the\r\ndreamers they used to be. And that makes for a film that keeps its audience at\r\na distance, never surprising them at all narratively and barely moving the\r\nneedle for its characters. It is fan fiction in film form. After ending a marriage that lasted only nine days with a\r\nhot person party in Ibiza (\u201cEntourage\u201d takes place in that dream movie world in\r\nwhich every extra in every scene from the people walking down the\r\nstreet to all the patrons of a restaurant could be a fashion model),\r\nVinny Chase (Adrian Grenier) wants to get back in the movie game. He calls up\r\nAri (Jeremy Piven) and convinces him to re-join his team as the producer on his\r\nnext flick, a futuristic take on the Stevenson classic, \u201cHyde.\u201d One catch:\r\nVinny wants to direct.  Ellin\u2019s script ignores most of the production process, immediately\r\nzipping us forward to days after filming has wrapped. Ari and his producing\r\npartners, including Texan walking-stereotype financiers played by Billy Bob\r\nThornton and Haley Joel Osment, still haven\u2019t seen a cut of the film, which\r\nVinny is clearly apprehensive about showing to anyone. Part of the problem is\r\nthat he needs more money on the already over-budget film to finish\r\npost-production. Ari agrees to go to Texas to talk to the money men about\r\ngetting the cash, but Chase is going to have to get over his nerves and show\r\nthe movie to everybody soon. Advertisement Meanwhile, E (Kevin Connolly) is having a baby with Sloan\r\n(Emmanuelle Chriqui) even though the two aren\u2019t together any more. Which means\r\nhe gets to have sex with multiple people one day and go to Lamaze the next. E\r\nand Sloan were always one of the weaker subplots of the HBO show and nothing\r\nhas changed here. In better news, Johnny Drama (Kevin Dillon) gets to steal a\r\nfew scenes with a solid arc about his \u201cbaby bro\u201d\u2019s movie being the one that\r\nfinally gives him a break. Finally, Turtle (Jerry Ferrara), who seems to have\r\nmade a million dollars for every pound he\u2019s lost, which is quite a few, almost\r\nliterally runs into Ronda Rousey, and tries to start a relationship with her.  The VERY little tension of \u201cEntourage\u201d comes when the son of\r\nChase\u2019s main financier, played with smarm by Osment, reports back that he hates\r\nthe cut of \u201cHyde\u201d that he\u2019s seen, especially the four scenes that include\r\nJohnny Drama. Will Vinny cut out his brother and betray his vision to get the\r\nmovie done? Have you seen the show? At the end of HBO\u2019s \u201cEntourage,\u201d the characters were wildly\r\nsuccessful, rich and happy. Guess what? They still are! Rather than take any\r\nchances, Ellin barely wrote a plot for the \u201cEntourage\u201d movie, using his time\r\ninstead to call in celebrity cameos and think of the prettiest locations in\r\nwhich to shoot them. Most of the dialogue is forced and unnatural, especially\r\nin the Connolly/Chriqui and Ferrara/Rousey subplots, but that\u2019s because it\r\ndoesn\u2019t matter what people say in the world of \u201cEntourage.\u201d All that matters is\r\nwho they party with, who they sleep with, and how much money they make. And the\r\nfilm suffers greatly from a plague of TV-to-film adaptations in that it gets\r\nstrikingly repetitive given that the people behind it are used to writing\r\n30-minutes narratives and spin their wheels when they try to go feature-length.\r\nWithout Piven and Dillon to keep it entertaining, it would be absolutely\r\ndreadful.  \u201cEntourage\u201d ended in such a way that I don\u2019t think even\r\ndiehard fans of the HBO show were overly concerned about Vinny and the boys.\r\nThere were no loose ends to tie up. And, in that sense, \u201cEntourage\u201d feels like\r\nanother victory lap for characters who had already won the race of life.\r\nInstead of challenging his characters or giving them something new to do, Ellin\r\njust high fives them on the way to the winner\u2019s circle.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Child's Pose", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Mothers are blamed for a lot, in cinema and in life. Their love is essential to a child's development, but too much of that same love is damaging. Wanting a close relationship with your adult child is healthy, but how close is too close? One of the greatest strengths of \"Child's \r\nPose\", Romania's 2014 Oscar-entry and winner of the Golden Bear this year in Berlin, is that these questions are presented, but no real answers are provided. The answers we get are murky, ambiguous, \r\ndisturbing. The truth is there, somewhere, but lost in an abyss of recriminations, resentment, and things too dark to discuss. It's an extremely strong and upsetting film, yet another example of the fascinating things going on in Romania's new wave, with a breathtaking lead performance by Luminita Gheorghiu as Cornelia, the competent career-woman in Bucharest, determined to clear her adult son's name. Advertisement Cornelia is a nosy mother. She is estranged from her son Barbu (Bogdan Dumitrache), and blames that estrangement on Barbu's girlfriend, whom she can barely reference without a sneer. Cornelia is a wealthy successful architect and gave her son all the privileges available to him in the chaotic post-Ceau\u0219escu era. \u00a0And yet he drifts, he lacks focus, he wants nothing to do with his mother. When he hits and kills a peasant child while speeding and is arrested for drunk driving, Cornelia, wrapped in furs, swoops in to the rescue. \"Child's Pose\", like so many other current Romanian films, is really about class. Cornelia is part of the Bucharest elite, and her friends are surgeons and famous opera singers. The family of the dead child are traditional peasants, described by one of the arresting officers as \"very simple people\". When Cornelia and the dead child's parents finally meet, in a scene almost absurd\u2014Cornelia chooses that moment to babble about her son's achievements and what a wonderful athlete he was as a teenager\u2014the culture clash is so enormous that it is as though nobody speaks the same language. Cornelia is convinced that her son is innocent, although all evidence points to the contrary. She sets out to clear his name, to make sure he is not railroaded by the cops (who all treat her with a mixture of impatience and condescension, an interloper in their more practical world). She is desperate to mend the relationship, and yet Barbu is totally closed to her overtures. Gheorghiu as Cornelia is elegant and hard, pained and calculating, competent and shifty. She chain-smokes, and does so in a glamorous way, holding the cigarette up and close to her face. Her eyes shift around the room, taking things in, thinking, re-evaluating, hedging her bets. She is not likable; she knows it and it\r\n doesn't matter to her. At the raucous birthday party thrown for her early in the film, she dances around with her husband in an empty ante-room, laughing and twirling like a little girl, and there's something tragic about her joie de vivre. There is damage here, somewhere, catastrophic and complete. Similar to Bong Joon-ho's \"Mother\", Cornelia is a mother who will stop at nothing to protect her son. Much of what Cornelia does is underhanded, at times indefensible. And Barbu is no prize. Cornelia describes him to others as \"warm and generous\", but that seems to be her fantasy of him. In the film, he remains mostly a sullen mystery, and only through a show-stopper of a scene between Cornelia and Barbu's girlfriend Carmen (Ilinca Goia), when Carmen opens up in graphic detail about their sex life (all as Cornelia sits silent and eager for the details), do we learn anything about him. We understand very early on that Cornelia is an unreliable narrator of her own life. In her version of events, she is a scorned martyr, she has done nothing wrong, all she \r\nhas done is love him, perhaps too much, but is that a crime? In one provocative scene, Cornelia rubs healing ointment into Barbu's back before he goes to sleep. The expression of relish and satisfaction on her face as she kneels astride her son is more eloquent than any dialogue could ever attempt. Advertisement Written by R\u0103zvan R\u0103dulescu (who also wrote \"The Death of Mr. Lazarescu\"), \"Child's Pose\" was directed by Calin Peter Netzer, and the film announces him as a major talent. The hand-held cinematography, gritty and raw, gives the film an immediate and urgent documentary feel, and each moment has a great sense of both the absurd and the poignant. Even minor characters are well-drawn and captured in small details that tell you who they are. In one early scene, Cornelia invites her maid to have a cup of coffee. Cornelia always has ulterior motives: her maid \r\nalso cleans Barbu's apartment, so Cornelia begins to grill the maid on the state of affairs at her son's place. Cornelia, smoking a cigarette and elegantly chilly with her blonde coiffure and beaded top, sits comfortably high in the culture's hierarchy and oozes oblivious privilege, all as the maid, wearing a third- or fourth-hand University of Southern California sweatshirt, squirms in embarrassment at being questioned about what books are on Barbu's nightstand. And even that question contains an ulterior motive: Cornelia gave Barbu two books, one by Herta Muller and one by Orhan Pamuk, and she wants to know if he has read them. \"They both won the Nobel, you know,\" Cornelia informs the maid, who can't even feign interest at such incomprehensible words. What makes Cornelia complex is that she operates from love. Her love is titanic, monumental, unstoppable. The film does not judge her. It merely presents her. It shows us where love can take us, what love becomes when it is thwarted, how twisted it can grow when it is not nurtured. \r\nAnd Gheorghiu, familiar to audiences already from her performances in \"Beyond the Hills\", \"4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days\", \"12:08 East of Bucharest\" and \"The Death of Mr. Lazarescu\", is fearless. Her performance as Cornelia is iconic in scope.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Cloverfield Paradox", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Let's go out on a limb and predict that February 4, 2018 will be seen as a watershed moment in the history of moving pictures. That was the Super Bowl Sunday when Netflix released the third entry in the popular \"Cloverfield\" series of science-fiction thrillers\u2014not to theaters, or even with a traditional long-lead buildup to online release, but simply by announcing that it was available that night, by way of an ad that ran during the game itself. Then the service sat back and watched social media light up with near-live reviews by people who were more interested in a new sci-fi film than in the game. By the following morning, reviews like this one started to appear, asking what it all meant\u2014not the movie, mind you, but the implications of releasing it this way.  Advertisement Turns out there were two masterstrokes here, and they were both about advertising. One was announcing what was, in essence, little more than a new Netflix menu selection during the telecast of North America's most-watched sporting event, guaranteeing that tens of millions of viewers would at least consider checking it out that night. The other masterstroke was figuring out how to generate excitement for a movie that might've barely made an impression had it been released in a more typical manner. \"The Cloverfield Paradox\" is a bit of a scam job, promising to reconcile entries in a series that have little in common save for a shared genre. It fizzles so badly at the end that you might legitimately wonder if it ever had anything to do with the other two films in the first place, or if it was produced independently of the series and retroactively added. Directed by Julius Onah and written by Oren Uziel, the film is set during a horrendous dystopian future in which the power grid keeps failing and the Russians are pondering a land invasion of the United Kingdom. Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays Hamilton, a scientist who leaves her doctor husband Michael (Roger Davies) on Earth to join the multinational, multi-ethnic crew of an orbital collider that's supposed to fire up and solve the world's energy problems.  Complications ensue, obviously: they're up there for quite a long time, and their actions somehow remove them from existence in their original reality and deposit them somewhere else, maybe on an alternate timeline. The relationships between people are subtly different, as are their own personal histories. People who should know each other don't, etc. Meanwhile, back on the original Earth, Michael wonders what happened to his wife and the space station where she once worked, and gets embroiled in a parallel adventure protecting a young girl from various threats, one of which might be making a cameo from another \"Cloverfield\" film.  Hamilton's colleagues in orbit include such ace character actors as Daniel Oyelowo, Chris O'Dowd, Daniel Bruhl, Aksel Hennie and Zhang Ziyi (speaking entirely in Chinese with subtitles, a nice touch). Frustratingly generic character writing ensures that none of them makes a strong impression, although the movie does use Hennie's chararacter, a paranoid Russian, as a human hand grenade, rather like the Michael Biehn character in \"The Abyss,\" and wisely gives O'Dowd most of the comic relief lines, which he sells but never oversells (his reaction to a moment of stomach-churning body horror is Bill Paxton-worthy).\u00a0  Advertisement Onah is a nimble and confident director, jumping right into the middle of action, giving the sci-fi vistas (in particular the orbital platform, which spins like a multilayered gyroscope) appropriately grandiose introductions, lingering on beautiful people and objects just because they're beautiful, and observing intriguing little details of production design (such as a faux-bagel that assembles itself in a kitchen contraption, and a tube of liquid metal sealant that works like a caulk gun). It's an\u00a0offhand style that's characteristic of post-\"Alien\" science fiction, where we're more awestruck by the world onscreen than any of the characters are. There are other compensatory pleasures, including the refreshingly straightforward and comprehensible photography by Dan Mindel (who shot the first two J.J. Abrams \"Star Trek\" movies, far more flashily) and Bear McCreary's music, which is reminiscent of Elliot Goldenthal's majestically bummed out score for \"Alien 3\" and adds about $10 million to the film's budget by daring to sound big.  But for the most part, this is a bust of a movie, the kind that would probably have otherwise gotten dumped to theaters in January by a studio looking to cut its losses. And it makes the series feel not like an anthology but a brand name guaranteeing medium-budget genre action with a bit more intelligence than was probably necessary but nowhere near the aesthetic ambition required to really stand out. The second \"Cloverfield\" entry, \"10 Cloverfield Lane,\" was a medium-budget art-house sci-fi film, the kind that might've shocked everyone in the '80s by making a fortune at drive-ins and strip malls; it became a hit on the basis of its ensemble acting and its unnerving intimacy\u2014never mind that ending, which confirmed that it was taking place in a different universe from the first \"Cloverfield,\" a homegrown American answer to a \"Godzilla\" movie. This one cobbles together scraps from the \"Alien\" series, \"Event Horizon,\" \"Final Destination, \"Solaris\" and about a dozen other films, doing a creditable job of seeming as if it has a lot on its mind until the moment arrives (soon into the film, alas) when you realize it doesn't.  J.J. Abrams, whose name is on the film as a producer, perfected the so-called \"mystery box\" method of storytelling that promises profound and shattering revelations only to pivot to bromides like, \"We should all be nicer to each other\" or \"Let's learn to forgive ourselves.\" The script to this one falls well within that wheelhouse. I'd like to visit the alternate universe where \"The Cloverfield Paradox\" is worthy of the stroke of PR genius that launched it.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Baby Driver", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Baby is a young man who creates remixes of his life. He records conversations had around him (almost always around and not with him) on an old-fashioned mini-cassette recorder, and then mixes them into songs with some wonderfully antiquated keyboard and rhythm equipment. The first one we see him create is called \u201cWas He Slow,\u201d using a question asked by an accomplice about Baby\u2019s mental capacity as a hook. Much like Baby turns the world around him into music, writer/director Edgar Wright remixes the movies and tunes that have influenced him into the wildly joyous and fantastically entertaining \u201cBaby Driver.\u201d As CGI robots clang into each other and superheroes take to the sky, here\u2019s Wright to ask if you remember how movies used to thrill us with a turn of phrase, a squeal of a wheel, a diving plot twist, or a romantic kiss. \u201cBaby Driver\u201d feels both influenced by the modern era of self-aware, pop-culture filmmaking and charmingly old-fashioned at the same time, which is only one of its minor miracles. It\u2019s as much fun as you\u2019re going to have in a movie theater this year. Advertisement Yes, his name is \u201cB-A-B-Y, Baby\u201d (Ansel Elgort). At least, that\u2019s the name he gives people when asked, although he\u2019s more often ignored. He\u2019s the nearly silent getaway driver for a robbery syndicate managed by Doc (Kevin Spacey), who organizes the crime, hires three criminals, and then puts them in Baby\u2019s car. You see, Baby can drive. But he needs music to do it. After a car accident as a kid left him with tinnitus, he spends the vast majority of his waking hours with ear buds in his ears to drown out the ringing. And the world around him moves to the music on one of his many iPods\u2014he has various ones for different moods. Sometimes the world seems to respond to his choice, sometimes his choice seems to influence the world around him\u2014either way, music is as essential to the success of \u201cBaby Driver\u201d as it was to \u201cLa La Land,\u201d maybe more. Take the riveting first scene. Three criminals\u2014Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), and Griff (Jon Bernthal)\u2014leap from a car outside of a bank just as Baby cues up \u201cBellbottoms\u201d by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in his 'buds. Everything from this point on moves in rhythm with the music from the slamming of the car doors after the bank robbers return to the squealing tires of one of the best car chase scenes in years. We\u2019ve seen countless action scenes scored to pop or rock songs, but how many have you seen in which the action works in unison with the music? And Wright takes this brilliant concept a step further, making even everyday normal activity feel like it\u2019s part of Baby\u2019s soundtrack. The sound of someone typing a text message on a phone or placing stacks of money on a table will work with the beat of a song, creating a film that has a rhythm, flow and structure from first frame to last that works in conjunction with its soundtrack. It\u2019s fluid and jaw-dropping\u2014the kind of thing you want to see immediately again after it\u2019s over to catch all the things you missed. The last paragraph probably makes \u201cBaby Driver\u201d sound like a music video, and has likely pushed out potential viewers looking for more substance than style. Trust me when I say that Wright doesn\u2019t skimp on the former. There\u2019s enough story and action here to satisfy without the music that drives the filmmaking. Much of the joy of this film is watching it unfold so I\u2019ll be brief with plot. Baby had a brief dalliance with crime, and he made the mistake of robbing from Doc, who now forces him to drive as penance. He\u2019s almost done. He has one more job for Doc and then he\u2019ll be back to his normal life. Of course, we all know how that typically turns out in crime movies. And when Baby meets a lovely waitress named Debora (Lily James), he finds a reason to go straight. That\u2019s all you need to know. Advertisement At its core, \u201cBaby Driver\u201d recalls decades of movies that anchored their narratives on criminals and the art of the car chase. There\u2019s a remarkably old-fashioned sensibility to the way Wright structures and details his film, and it\u2019s not just because his two genetically blessed stars look like they could have walked out of a 1940s noir (their All-American aesthetic is even more striking in a few gorgeous black-and-white shots that recall old Hollywood even more). \u201cBaby Driver\u201d is a high-concept film that never underwhelms detail, and it\u2019s those charming little beats within the overall tune that hold it together. It helps greatly that few people know how to assemble a cast like Edgar Wright. Elgort and James are engaging, charismatic leads with fantastic chemistry. Unlike most Hollywood action movies, the survival of the heroes here becomes something we actively root for instead of just know is likely to happen. The \u201cvillains\u201d of the piece are perfectly cast and directed as well, particularly Spacey and Jamie Foxx as the menacing Bats. Both roles are written and cast in a way that they could have stolen focus with performances that play to the cheap seats but neither actor ever does. Foxx is particularly phenomenal in a role that\u2019s both funny and filled with simmering danger. It\u2019s one of those films where every single role, from the burly diner chef to the sweet post office employee, feels like it was cast with exactly the right person. It creates a sense of additional magic in a film when you can sense that every single element, even the most minor ones, is working exactly as its creator intended. There\u2019s an energy that you can feel in the theater when a movie is really working. It\u2019s the guy next to you jumping a bit in his seat as a car takes a hard corner. It\u2019s the woman behind you laughing extra hard at a joke. It\u2019s the sense that everyone is fully engaged, almost tapping their feet to the rhythm of the film. I still believe this is why most people go to the movies with crowds of strangers\u2014to feel that shared magic and nod their heads in unison to the cinematic tune. \u201cBaby Driver\u201d will be one of your favorite songs of the year. Listen to it with a crowd. And loud. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Abortion: Stories Women Tell", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Watching HBO\u2019s \u201cAbortion:\r\nStories Women Tell,\u201d which gets a limited theatrical release this week before an\r\nairing on the network, I was struck by how many documentaries on the subject I\u2019ve\r\nseen in just the last few years. And I was struck even more by the variety in\r\ntheir approach: \u201cTrapped\u201d focuses on the laws that are essentially making\r\nabortion illegal in several states; The excellent \u201cAfter Tiller\u201d looks at the\r\nfew doctors left willing to perform third-trimester abortions and the danger\r\nthey face to do what they think is right. \u201cAbortion: Stories Women Tell\u201d has a clear focus that's right there in its title: approaching the subject from the women with\r\nfirst-hand experience. In an interesting twist, director Tracy Droz Tragos\r\ndoesn\u2019t only speak to the women who have chosen to have abortions but people\r\nlike the security guard at the clinic (nicknamed Chi Chi because she\u2019s small\r\nand feisty like a Chihuahua) and even those on the other side of the issue,\r\nincluding prominent female voices in the pro-life organization 40 Days For\r\nLife. But what\u2019s essential about Tragos\u2019 film is that the male voices we hear\r\nare almost exclusively on the fringe: men in the parking lot of a clinic\r\nyelling about Jesus or lawmakers trying to essentially subvert Roe v. Wade.\r\nThis is an issue about women\u2019s rights and so this powerful film exclusively listens to the stories\r\nthat women tell.\u00a0 Advertisement Some of those stories\r\nare among the most resonant I\u2019ve heard in a documentary this year. Particularly\r\nmemorable is the tale of Amie, a young woman who simply can\u2019t afford to have another baby\r\nas she already works multiple jobs to keep her child fed as it is. Several of\r\nthe people we meet in \u201cAbortion: Stories Women Tell\u201d are in this situation:\r\nknowing that their family will go hungry if there\u2019s another mouth to feed.\r\nOthers are in that tragic position in which they\u2019ve learned that their\r\nbaby won\u2019t survive after birth. Others are in abusive relationships. A\r\nwoman tells a heartbreaking tale of being with such an abusive partner that she\r\nknew bringing a baby into the situation would only put her child\u2019s safety at\r\nrisk. It\u2019s important to realize, although Tragos doesn\u2019t underline this fact,\r\nthat every story is different. Money, health, abuse\u2014everyone has a reason, and\r\ndespite what pro-life proponents would have you believe, none of those reasons\r\nfeel poorly-considered. \u201cAbortion: Stories Women\r\nTell\u201d takes an interesting turn when it crosses the aisle, presenting\r\ninterviews with people trying to shut down clinics in Missouri (which they have\r\nessentially done, sending women who need abortions over state lines to the more\r\nlenient Illinois). Tragos\u2019 allegiance is clear, but these films often falter\r\nwhen they demonize the opponent, and hearing a woman honestly speak about how\r\nshe believes she\u2019s saving lives when she protests abortion clinics highlights\r\nthe complexity of the issue. She doesn\u2019t have any doubt that\r\nwhat she\u2019s doing is right. And Tragos\u2019 film is at its best when it\u2019s interested\r\nin commonality. There\u2019s a great moment in which a woman who works at the\r\nIllinois clinic where most of the film takes place sings along to protestors\r\nwith \u201cJesus Loves Me.\u201d One of the last lines of the film is \u201cDo what you think\r\nis right.\u201d So many people involved with the war for the right to legal and safe\r\nabortions and those against them are\r\ndoing what they think is right. While \u201cAbortion: Stories\r\nWomen Tell\u201d strengthens its clear pro-choice stance by allowing the other side\r\nsome time in front of the camera, it is not an overtly political film. We learn\r\nabout the dynamic along this Midwestern border, in which one state has TRAP laws so tough that it pushes women in need to another, and that naturally\r\ncarries some political baggage, but it is the women and their stories that\r\nmatter. It is the faces, particularly Amie\u2019s incredible courage and humanity to\r\nlet us share a very difficult journey with her, that people will remember. And\r\nthat\u2019s why these films keep getting made, and keep mattering to viewers. As people\r\ndebate the issue in presidential campaigns, it is the world of the documentary\r\nthat reminds us what this issue is really about: Women. Listen to their stories.

{"Title": "La Bare", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Actor Joe Manganiello (\"True Blood,\" \"Magic Mike,\") had originally conceived of \"La Bare\" as a reality TV series detailing the backstage life of the male dancers at La Bare in Dallas, known as \"the most popular male strip club in the world.\" Manganiello's research for playing his role in \"Magic Mike\" had pierced through his preconceived notions of what male strippers were like, and he was curious to learn more. \"La Bare\" shows\u00a0its reality-TV origin in its structure, to sometimes a clich\u00e9d degree, but overall it is a friendly and affectionate backstage look at the world of the mostly-straight male dancers at La Bare. Advertisement There are \"confessionals\" with the various dancers, all of whom have different strengths (one says, \"I can't dance at all. But I can f***. So I use that in my act.\"), there are glimpses of the shows themselves, the screaming women, there are interviews with fans.\u00a0Some of the really interesting elements are merely sketched in, like how La Bare, which has been around since the '70s, turned itself around from a kind of skeevy dive into the showstopping club it is today. A new owner came along, a Russian named Alex, who is interviewed wearing a T-shirt with \"CCCP\" across the front. He wanted to create a strip club that was run like a business; he wanted to hire dancers who thought like businessmen and\u00a0weren't drug addicts or troublemakers; he wanted to build a brand. And he did. Alex would be compelling enough for an entire documentary. The dancers come from all walks of life. One talks about how he was homeschooled and not allowed to listen to secular music, which meant he had no idea how to dance \"to the beat\" in his early time as a dancer. One had owned a restaurant, which he then lost, and\u00a0uses dancing as a way to make money to open up another restaurant. One, with a blue mohawk and multiple piercings, talks about his time in Afghanistan and Iraq as a Ranger. Overseeing the dancers at La Bare is a larger-than-life personality named Randy (aka \"The Master Blaster\"), who has been a dancer for 34 straight years (he's in the Guinness Book of World Records). He jokes that he has now performed for\u00a0five generations of women. Randy has no children of his own and sees the dancers as his sons. He \"raises them,\" reminding them of the Golden Rule, for example. He puts them on diets, he helps them with workout plans. Randy is unable to speak without making a motivational speech. He has a devoted fan base. To counteract the idea that stripping is somehow a depressing job, and the idea that male strippers are even more \"beyond the pale\" than females, \"La Bare\" highlights the positive to destabilize those expectations. We are accustomed to female strippers being presented as victims, a simplistic attitude, and certainly not true for all of them. \"La Bare\" shows the dancers as a tight group of friends, highlighted by the fact that just prior to filming, one of the dancers, the beloved \"Angelo\" (Ruben Riguero), was killed after a scuffle at a local club for apparently no reason. But other than that, the \"horror stories\" one may expect do not materialize. These guys are more like body builders, concerned about salt intake and limiting alcohol consumption. They also try not to sleep with clientele. It's just bad business. Advertisement Each guy is extremely open to the camera, a tribute to Manganiello's questioning and attitude. One can imagine the suspicion with which the project may have been treated initially. The dancers are sensitive about being misrepresented. The openness of the interviews is captivating. The difference between strip clubs catering to men and those catering to women is discussed in the film, by both the owners of the club, as well as the dancers and the women who flock to La Bare. La Bare invests a lot of money in the shows, and each guy has a particular \"act\", some of them elaborate to an almost Cirque de Soleil degree. The guys do calendars and private parties and promotions and it's all about creating a brand for themselves. A female stripper says about all of this, \"For these guys, it is their whole lives.\" For her, not so much. So what is different about a strip club catering to women as opposed to men? One of the La Bare regulars observes that \"men are like a microwave, and women are like an oven \u2026 we need that pre-heat time.\"\u00a0Throughout the film the dancers as well as the owners of the club echo that thought. For the women who come to La Bare, they want the romance and the fantasy of the show itself, they want to be drawn in and swept away. To the dancers, female fantasy is the air they breathe: they don't treat it with condescension or contempt, they cater to it directly. It's strangely refreshing in today's climate where there are worried think-pieces about what 50 Shades of Grey means and what should we DO about it? \"La Bare\" takes its time to profile some of the side figures, like Pablo the backstage hand, or the guy who DJs for the club. These sections feel like filler. They sag and lag. It is the dancers who fascinate, and in its own stealthy way, \"La Bare\" opens up a little bit of breathing space around the idea of masculinity, how it operates, and what it actually looks like. There are definitely depths to be plumbed in the conversation about objectification and sexuality, particularly in the realm of men. \"La Bare\" approaches the issue indirectly, and yet in a way, it's the whole point. Men who put their sexuality out there like that are often seen as \"feminized\", and that word is used an insult (disturbing because it assumes that being \"feminine\" is a negative). These guys don't worry about any of that. They are there as fantasy figures and they work hard to provide that fantasy. One of the dancers reports that he asked a woman why she likes coming to La Bare so often. She replied, \"When I come here, I feel pretty.\" That's a pretty strong statement about what these shows provide. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Rewrite", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "There was a period spanning from the near-mid 1990s to the\r\nearly 2000s when a particular kind of Hugh Grant movie ruled the romantic\r\ncomedy world. I don\u2019t mean every single Hugh Grant movie, but quite a few Hugh\r\nGrant movies, mind you. I call them the \u201cRedeemable S**ts\u201d films. That is, they\r\nfeature Mr. Grant at his slickest and most glibly charming, except he\u2019s a\r\nterrible-to-awful cad (but not to a Ted Bundy extent, of course, and\r\nthankfully) except also that he can be\r\nsaved, and it\u2019s only through forced exposure to and interaction with Better\r\nPeople that he can be saved.  Advertisement This formula, which arguably reached its commercial and, um,\r\nartistic peak with 2002\u2019s \u201cAbout A Boy\u201d drives Grant\u2019s latest picture, \u201cThe\r\nRewrite, \u201c which was written and directed by Marc Lawrence, who also created\r\n2007\u2019s \u201cMusic and Lyrics,\u201d an intermittently diverting rom-com co-starring Drew\r\nBarrymore that suggested that maybe a breather from the tried and true might be\r\nin order. Unfortunately for Grant, that breather consisted of the universally\r\nface-palmed 2009 \u201cDid You Hear About The Morgans\u201d and the misbegotten Wachowski\r\nliterary adaptation \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d in 2012. \u201cThe Rewrite,\u201d in which Grant plays\r\na once-acclaimed, now down-on-his-luck Hollywood screenwriter compelled to head\r\neast and teach a scenario-crafting class at a university in remote, cloudy,\r\nfine-cuisine-challenged Binghamton, New York, must have felt as cozy as a\r\nfavorite sweater to the actor.  And indeed, he gives great Hugh Grant cad once he touches\r\ndown in the college town, immediately insulting Jane Austen to an icy\r\ndepartment head (Alison Janney) whose specialty is Jane Austen, bedding down a\r\ncomely student (Bella Heathcote) even before convening his first session,\r\nadvising a \u201cStar Wars\u201d nerd to join a frat, and dribbling condescension on a\r\nplucky single mom who\u2019s going to school to improve herself but who may in fact\r\nhave some real talent.  Given that the aforementioned plucky single mom is played by\r\nMarisa Tomei, you have an idea where all this is going to end up.

{"Title": "Fed Up", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Are you a Peter Frampton fan? And when I say \"Peter Frampton fan,\" I mean a BIG Peter Frampton fan. I mean someone who goes back farther than his once-universally beloved 1976 hit double-LP \"Frampton Comes Alive.\" I mean someone who maybe goes as far back as The Herd with Frampton, although not necessarily. I\u2019ll cut to the chase. Are you someone who knows the 1973 album called \"Frampton\u2019s Camel,\" and a track on it called \"White Sugar\"? I\u2019m asking this question because, if you are, and if you do, you can pretty much skip the movie \"Fed Up,\" because Frampton\u2019s song \"White Sugar,\" the chorus of which condemns the titular substance as \"evil as the day you were born\" sums up the message of the new documentary \"Fed Up\" in a nutshell, or a teaspoon if you will.  Advertisement I don\u2019t mean to be glib. Or maybe I do. As someone who\u2019s struggled on and off with weight issues ever since my metabolism betrayed me in my mid-twenties, I suppose I\u2019m in some ways a member of this movie\u2019s target audience as an examination of America\u2019s rising obesity stats and of the food industry\u2019s economic interest in encouraging, or even enforcing, unhealthy eating habits.\u00a0 Over the course of its ninety or so minutes, \"Fed Up,\" executive produced by Katie Couric (who also narrates) and Laurie David, and directed by Stephanie Soechtig, offers up a lot of information about nutrition and the food industry, some of which I didn\u2019t know or had an only vague awareness of, and alternates talking head interviews with PhDs with mini-portraits of poignant obese kids and teens across this great land of ours. Along the way it explains why the magic words \"low fat\" aren\u2019t so magic, how the calories from an almond metabolize differently than the calories from a sweetened soft drink, and why high fructose corn syrup and, yes, white sugar is as evil as the days they were born.  \"I don\u2019t think high-fructose corn syrup is a good use of corn,\" former President Bill Clinton muses at one point in the film, going on to admit that his administration could have done more about this issue. (Is it just me or has Clinton said that about a LOT of things his administration ended up not doing much about? Hell, and I like the guy.) The movie pulls few punches in condemning collusion between the food industry and Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and even Michelle Obama\u2019s anti-obesity initiative\u2014supposedly, if you read National Review, a sacrament for liberals\u2014 comes in for criticism for emphasizing the wrong sides of the issue. The information is arguably compelling, and disturbing, but something about the whole delivery mode turned me off. As cinema, the movie is profoundly uninspired and commonplace, albeit well-made, or even slick. I\u2019m not sure whether the filmmakers knew that their slo-mo shots of sugar in heaping teaspoons is actually kind of mouth-watering, but there you go. More irksome is the fact that Katie Couric and Laurie David, both of whose personal fortunes were achieved with no small participation from the Coca Cola Company, have now decided to impart to us peons that the Coca Cola Company is in fact the devil. When, in fact, the Coca Cola Company is merely doing something that a larger system aggressively enables it to do. Like most movies of its bent, \"Fed Up\" can\u2019t admit the thing that Al Pacino gets so tetchy about at the climax of \"And Justice For All...,\" which is that \"the whole system is out of order.\" It can\u2019t\u2014won\u2019t\u2014see the forest for the trees, because it is in fact a product of the same system that produces Coca Cola. Why the viewer ought to trust it more than it trusts the Coca Cola Company is a question left unanswered. Anyway, I trust Peter Frampton. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Frank & Lola", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"Frank and Lola\" starts right in the middle of a frank sex scene between its leads, the fortysomething chef Frank (Michael Shannon) and the recent college graduate and would-be fashion designer Lola (Imogen Poots), and it continues in that vein, dropping us into the middle of moments, relationships and predicaments and expecting us to find our way through them. It's a terrific gambit, as well a welcome break from the preferred method of storytelling in romantic dramas, which is more along the lines of, \"Hi, John, how is your brother, who I haven't seen in twelve years, and who betrayed me?\" The problem is that, despite being played by two charismatic and more-than-capable actors, the title characters never click in the way they need to. They're too cool and vague for the volcanic story they enact. Advertisement Plot twists pile up, and a light-footed, psycho-sexual character study becomes something like a film noir revenge thriller. Frank goes to Paris, ostensibly to look into a potentially lucrative chef job set up by Lola's mother (Rosanna Arquette, overdoing the shallow self-regard and sexual voraciousness; when she tells Frank, \"I can't wait to taste your food,\" I expected her to add a cartoon-y meow). But the job interview is a pretext to confront the would-be patron (played by Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist), the owner of the Las Vegas hotel where Frank would serve as head chef. This man raped Lola years ago. She credits him with jump-starting a pattern of self-destructive sexual behavior, which includes an impulsive one-night stand at a hotel with a guy she admits means nothing to her (Frank is devastated).  So far, so good\u2014many a memorable seventies thriller has gotten by on less plot than \"Frank and Lola\" offers. But we're still left with the nagging feeling that debut writer/director Matthew Ross and his cast never quite got a handle on what draws these two to each other, what would make Lola disclose that devastating story to Frank after years of telling no one (including family), and what demons would compel Frank to fly across the Atlantic and come on like Charles Bronson in khakis.  When they're together, there's a relaxed, whispery quality to their interactions that's at odds with the mad foolish love so much of the plot seems to require. From a distance, theirs seems like a relationship that might have another six months left in it, the kind of brief but intense extended affair that they'll both fantasize about occasionally, years or even decades later, but without spending too much time wondering what might have been because they already know the answer. There's something missing here, something big, something that would have tied up all the film's finer qualities into a coherent whole. The most frustrating thing about realizing it is that it's impossible to know exactly what could have been done to create the spark this movie needed to combust.  Shannon is, as usual, superb, turning Frank into a believably scruffy neo-noir hero with a rough past: he left home when he was just 16 and has been working in kitchens ever since, and there are intimations of abuse in his past, which partly (if not fully) illuminates his Paris crusade. Poots makes nearly as strong an impression, but unfortunately this is not her movie. Where Frank is allowed a rich interior life and drives much of the action, Lola is primarily his inspiration, the force that compels him to act and react. I would have liked to have seen more exploration of her psyche, with Frank serving as gruff sounding board, and less of the \"Death Wish Lite\" stuff.  Advertisement The supporting cast is filled with ace character actors and rising stars, including Justin Long as a smarmy younger man who says he wants to help Lola with her fashion career and makes that seem like a euphemism. And Ross has a great sense of how to build a scene and let actors carry it, while still paying attention to light and space and never allowing the camera to become a mere recording device. The movie is at its best when jealousy is welling up in Frank, and Lola is feeling a combination of shame and resentment at the notion that she's responsible for his anger. But \"Frank and Lola\" ultimately feels like less of a compelling, free-standing work than a promise of better movies to come.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "True Memoirs of an International Assassin", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "I\u2019ll say this about the latest Netflix Original Comedy, \u201cTrue Memoirs of an International Assassin\u201d: It looks and feels like a real movie. Unlike so many Happy Madison ventures, including Netflix Originals \u201cThe Ridiculous Six\u201d and \u201cThe Do-Over,\u201d this flick has a director who considered visual composition and pacing, and someone actually wrote a screenplay. The script by Jeff Morris, which was on the notorious Black List of the best unproduced screenplays, is surprisingly plot-heavy, something also uncommon for other films starring Kevin James and Adam Sandler, which typically amount to little more than a series of jokes loosely strung together by an unbelievable plot. Ultimately, \u201cTrue Memoirs of an International Assassin\u201d isn\u2019t entertaining enough to recommend, but it\u2019s certainly not the torturous experience of recent James vehicles like \u201cPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2\u201d or \u201cPixels,\u201d and parts of it actually work. Advertisement The star of \u201cThe King of Queens\u201d (an admitted guilty pleasure in reruns for this writer) plays Sam Larson, a cubicle-tethered schlub who has few friends and a horrible boss. He imagines himself the lead of a book he\u2019s writing in his spare time called Memoirs of an International Assassin. Getting advice from a bar mate and former soldier named Amos (Ron Rifkin) about the ins and outs of covert ops, Sam delivers an entertaining, action-packed adventure novel to his new publisher Kylie (Kelen Coleman), who promises \u201cnot to change a word.\u201d She doesn\u2019t. She just adds the word \u201cTrue\u201d to the front of the title, sending Sam\u2019s real life spinning. Now, he\u2019s appearing on talk shows and trying to defend a story of international espionage which he made up. Of course, it\u2019s not long before he\u2019s kidnapped and thrust into the middle of a high-danger situation in Venezuela. The specific details of the international portion of Sam\u2019s adventure are pretty clever in their complexity. Sam first meets El Toro (Andy Garcia), who wants a crime lord named Masovich (Andrew Howard) murdered. Masovich intercepts Sam and orders him to assassinate the President (Kim Coates), who then intercepts Sam and orders him to assassinate El Toro. It's the circle of espionage. Sam, who most people think is the international assassin known as \u201cThe Ghost,\u201d gains a partner in a freedom fighter named Rosa Bolivar (Zulay Henao) and Rob Riggle and Leonard Earl Howze pop up as a couple of U.S. agents who almost watch Sam/Ghost\u2019s current dilemma with skeptical joy. They take wagers as to whether or not he\u2019s actually an assassin and eat popcorn while watching surveillance footage of him trying just to survive. For the most part, \u201cTrue Memoirs of an International Assassin\u201d is just crowded enough to be an entertaining diversion. The problem is that Morris and director Jeff Wadlow go back to the same jokes way too many times\u2014we see multiple scenes of Sam imagining action sequences that don\u2019t really happen and there\u2019s an odd habit in the final act to pepper the soundtrack with Spanish-language versions of American pop songs. The bigger problem is a distinct lack of actual laughs from those jokes, even the first time we hear them. I chuckled once or twice at Riggle & Howze, but it\u2019s tempting to not even categorize the film as a comedy. It\u2019s a melting pot of a diversion, too thin in any specific genre department to really register. It\u2019s not action-packed enough, not funny enough, and the characters aren\u2019t memorable enough. Having said that, it\u2019s never eye-rollingly unfunny, offensive or blatantly stupid. Perhaps this is a low bar to clear, but it\u2019s a time-killer, something that could make a couple hours go by faster if you\u2019re in need of something to speed up the clock. Movies should do more than just kill your time, and this one could have with smarter dialogue and actual characters, but there\u2019s something to be said about a distraction from the international drama of this week, true or not.

Advertisement The best scene in \u201cTriple 9\u201d is arguably its first real\r\nset-piece, the robbery of a downtown Atlanta bank by former special ops\r\nmastermind Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor), dirty cop #1 Marcus Belmont\r\n(Anthony Mackie), dirty cop #2 Jorge Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.), getaway\r\nman Russel Welch (Norman Reedus), and his brother Gabe (Aaron Paul), a\r\ncharacter who might as well being wearing a red shirt and named \u201cFuture\r\nLiability.\u201d Hillcoat and cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis (\u201cThe Drop\u201d)\r\nframe the bank robbery beautifully, taking us from the high-pressure of the\r\nvault to the getaway gone wrong after a red dye pack explodes. It\u2019s tense,\r\nwell-shot and sets up the audience for a high stakes thriller that never comes. It turns out the quintet wasn\u2019t there for the money\u2014they were\r\ntasked with stealing a very specific safety deposit box by Russian mob mastermind\r\nIrina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet), who is now refusing to pay the group until they\r\nperform another job. Irina has control over Michael because Michael has a son\r\nwith Irina\u2019s sister Elena (Gal Gadot) that the Russians are basically holding\r\nhostage, not allowing his father to see him. This plot thread is not only\r\npoorly-developed, it\u2019s a little morally grotesque in that it feels designed to\r\ncreate sympathy for someone who should be a villain, especially when we learn\r\nwhat the title means. If you don\u2019t know, 999 is the code for \u201cofficer down.\u201d In their\r\nplanning of the second heist, which involves a Homeland Security building, the\r\ngroup decides that the best way to distract the rest of the force will be to\r\nkill a cop. As they say, every car responds to a triple nine. And they\u2019ll all be\r\ndistracted enough to not be able to respond to the new heist. Conveniently,\r\nMarcus gets a green new partner in Chris Allen (Casey Affleck). They\u2019ll set up\r\nAllen to get killed, and pull off one final job for Irina while the city is\r\ndescending on the crime scene. They never bother to consider that Allen\u2019s uncle\r\n(Woody Harrelson) is leading the investigation into who they are. Or that the\r\nincreasingly unstable Gabe is a problem. Or that their entire plan is based on a lot\r\nof coincidences and plot holes that we only see in movies. Advertisement Most of \u201cTriple 9\u201d is shot in close-up and near-total\r\ndarkness. Hillcoat and Karakatsanis mistakenly think that this will compensate\r\nfor a lack of character or plot worth caring about. So, we get sweaty, dirty,\r\ngrimy camerawork, under-lit to a nearly-parodic degree, but none of it\r\nresonates beyond showy filmmaking. The film is constantly calling attention to\r\nits visual style (or lack thereof) because there\u2019s so little else on which to\r\nfocus. Despite casting so many talented people, writer Matt Cook and Hillcoat\r\ngive them almost nothing to do. They are cogs in a plot machine with nothing notable\r\nabout their characters or back stories outside of the descriptions you read\r\nabove. Michael has a kid. Gabe is the junkie. Chris is the new guy. That is it. If Hillcoat is trying to say\r\nanything about macho male behavior, the police force, capitalism, or even the\r\nRussian mob, he fails to do so.  The forgettable thinness of the characters is problematic\r\nthroughout but especially in the final act when one realizes you just don\u2019t\r\ncare about these people or what\u2019s going to happen to them. If one subscribes to\r\nthe theory that people can learn as much from a bad movie as from a good one,\r\nwatch the scenes between two of our best actors\u2014Kate Winslet and Chiwetel\r\nEjiofor. Neither have the depth of character or artful purpose that these\r\ntwo have brought to films before. And so their relationship, one of the\r\ndefining ones of the film, has no resonance at all. To be fair, Anthony Mackie\r\nhas so much natural charisma that it shines through every now and then and\r\nCasey Affleck sometimes looks like he\u2019s aware of the better film in which this\r\ncharacter could play a crucial role. It\u2019s also worth noting that when character\r\nhas to take a back seat\u2014in a few action sequences, including a riveting gang shoot-out,\r\nthe movie works. It\u2019s when dialogue and an increasingly-ludicrous plot kicks in\r\nthat the movie fails in head-shaking ways. Every talented cast member will move on from the errors of \u201cTriple\r\n9\u201d and on to bigger and better things. Most of them have already. Follow their\r\nlead.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Raid 2", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "In the 1973 movie \"Sleeper,\" the hapless, frazzled character played by Woody Allen makes a hyperbolic but ineffectual threat to a screaming Diane Keaton: \"If you don't shut up I'm gonna take this rock and bring it down on your head so hard that a substance resembling guacamole is gonna come out of your ears.\" I thought of that line rather often while watching \"The Raid 2,\" in which the cops and criminals doing incessant battle have to go to similar lengths to vanquish, or even just temporarily incapacitate, their foes. With disquieting frequency, a fractured limb, a baseball bat to the cranium, a bisecting slash to the external carotid artery, that sort of thing, simply aren't enough. No, in the world of \"The Raid 2,\" you've got to get your foe on the ground, and bang his (or her!) head against the floor or the pavement until\u2026you know. Only the substance is red so it doesn't really resemble guacamole. In addition, you wanna go for severely dislocated jaws, third degree burns where you least want to see them (I understand this raises the question of where you most want to see them, and that IS deliberate), potential/partial disembowelings, and more.  Advertisement This movie, as its title implies, is a sequel to \"The Raid: Redemption,\" the 2012 Indonesian action film directed by the Welsh-born Gareth Evans, whose cinematic mission in life was, some reports have it, handed down to him when he was first exposed to the Indonesian martial arts. The nearly non-stop action of \"The Raid,\" which is an epic depiction of a drug raid on an apartment block in which hordes of cops and criminals have at each other, is largely martial-arts driven, but with plenty of shooting and slashing, all of it shot in excruciatingly you-are-there close range and edited to both make your head spin and give you whiplash. Action aficionados hailed the movie as some kind of ne plus ultra, and Evans has clearly been eager to answer the fan question \"How is he gonna top THAT?\"  Evans does get around to topping it, with a climactic sequence that's about 45 minutes worth of mayhem that includes a very crunchy car-chase/shootout and a one-on-one battle that destroys a climate-controlled wine room in high style. The plot is both simplicity itself and impossible to follow: Rama, the hero of the first film, is compelled to go undercover to rout both corrupt cops and crime lords and the lethal henchmen of both camps. It's impossible to follow because there are just so damn many crime lords etcetera to keep up with, not that they're all that distinctive. The Fredo-esque son of one crime lord, Uco (Arifin Putra) distinguishes himself with sleek features and a jaded air, both of which genuinely suggest that he'd rather be fronting a Suede tribute band than doing mobster stuff. That's probably not a good thing. I also found that Oka Antara, who plays a stalwart enforcer who's not quite what he seems, gave better action leading man than Iko Uwais, who plays Rama.  None of this much matters of course. What matters is a machete-wielding contract killer, a pair of baddies who kill with baseball equipment and hammers, respectively (the latter character is named \"Hammer Girl,\" say what), and all the sound and fury that is delivered with such a relentlessly straight face and gritted teeth that Tarantino's \"Kill Bill\" pictures look like \"The Gang's All Here\" by comparison. The intensity really falls flat during the scenes in which the action stops and various characters ponder the vicissitudes of loyalty and betrayal and all that. These sequences suggest that the lack of anything BUT action in the first movie was an indication of Evans realizing his limitations.  In any event, nobody's going to mistake these passages for Shakespeare. But the action stuff in \"The Raid 2,\" while likely to alienate the squeamish and summon dark thoughts of cinematic nihilism amongst overthinking highbrows, really IS like nothing else out there. All those looking for a new kick are advised to seek it out, but don't blame me for the headache with which you might leave the theater.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Snowden", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "If Edward Snowden didn\u2019t exist, Oliver Stone might have\r\ninvented him. One can imagine a Stone film about a former employee of the U.S.\r\ngovernment who becomes disillusioned with his country when he learns the depth\r\nof its deceit. In fact, that last sentence could describe a few Stone films,\r\nand so \u201cSnowden\u201d has been widely anticipated as a return to form for the\r\ndirector of masterpieces like \u201cPlatoon,\u201d \u201cJFK\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s his first film in four years and his first with a true story behind it in\r\nalmost a decade (\u201cW.\u201d). Advertisement History will recognize Stone as one of the most\r\nimportant cinematic historians when it comes to the stories of his country,\r\nfrom Vietnam to Richard Nixon to 9/11. And so it makes perfect sense that he\r\nwould be attracted to the story of Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who\r\nrevealed the scope of just how little privacy we have in a post-9/11 world.\r\nStone made the very smart move to hire a committed, underrated actor to play\r\nthe challenging lead role, and the result is a film that thrives off its\r\ncentral performance. Some of the elements around that performance are a bit\r\nlacking, especially the script, but there\u2019s an energy here that Stone hasn\u2019t\r\nhad in a few films, as if he's been enlivened by a subject he was destined to\r\ndocument. \u201cSnowden\u201d actually opens with a scene that will be very\r\nfamiliar to viewers of the Oscar-winning \u201cCitizenfour\u201d\u2014that film\u2019s director,\r\nLaura Poitras (Melissa Leo), and journalist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto)\r\nare going to meet Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who then recounts the last few years of his\r\nlife under extreme cover (cell phones go in the microwave, for example). The\r\nstructure of Kieran Fitzgerald and Stone\u2019s script essentially alternates between\r\nthree stories\u2014the story of Snowden\u2019s discovery of his government\u2019s\r\nhighly intrusive and global surveillance; the story of Snowden\u2019s romance with\r\nLindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley) and how it was impacted by his top-secret jobs;\r\nand the story of the release of what Snowden knew, as documented in \u201cCitizenfour.\u201d\r\nAll three arcs have that \u201cJFK\u201d-esque tendency to have even the smallest roles\r\nfilled by recognizable faces: Rhys Ifans, Tom Wilkinson, Nicolas Cage, Timothy\r\nOlyphant, Joely Richardson, Logan Marshall-Green, Keith Stanfield, Ben Chaplin and more pop up throughout the complex story. And this story is truly complex, especially in the way Stone\r\nand Fitzgerald have chosen to tackle it. They offer a little bit of \u201cthe early days\r\nof Edward,\u201d but it\u2019s not long before Snowden is, shall we say, seeing how the\r\nsausage gets made. For those viewers who have not seen \u201cCitizenfour\u201d or read\r\nmany of the articles written about Snowden, the mid-section of Stone\u2019s\r\nfilm could prove incredibly shocking, and may force a trend of people putting\r\npieces of tape over their laptop camera. That covert operations run by our\r\ngovernment have the capability to turn on your laptop camera without you\r\nknowing it is only one of the revelations here. And as Snowden continues to get\r\ndeeper into the rabbit hole of privacy invasion, Gordon-Levitt\u2019s performance\r\nbecomes more exceptional. At first, it feels like something of an impression\r\n(although a really good one, for the record), but the film works in the way that Gordon-Levitt captures the conflicted inner turmoil of Snowden as the story progresses. He has a remarkable ability to do what so many other actors can\u2019t:\r\nlook at a computer screen and take in its information as if he\u2019s seeing\r\nit for the first time. He grounds a complex story by giving it a very human,\r\nreactive element at its center. Advertisement Stone's film falters with the relationship\r\ndrama involving Snowden and Shailene Woodley's Lindsay Mills. Both actors do their best to make these scenes connect, but\r\nsome moments feel like they came out of another movie and the pair doesn't quite have the right chemistry to make them effective. I understand the\r\nintention\u2014to balance the inordinate number of sequences in front of computer\r\nscreens with a flesh and blood dynamic\u2014but they just don't work, partially due to\r\nflat dialogue but also because they don\u2019t have the energy of the rest of the\r\nfilm. They almost feel like an obligation\u2014a producer\u2019s note to make the film more relatable\u2014but it creates a herky-jerky pace to \u201cSnowden\u201d that keeps it\r\nfrom building steam. I\u2019m sure there were dozens of drafts exploring\r\ndifferent ways to tackle this story, and I'm not convinced they found precisely the\r\nright one. Less relationship drama, and perhaps going chronological from front to back\r\ninstead of using flashback structure, might have helped the rhythm. Despite my issues with the structure of \u201cSnowden,\u201d there are numerous accomplished scenes and the film is carried throughout by\r\nGordon-Levitt. It\u2019s in his body language, which captures a man truly\r\nconflicted about what to do with the information he\u2019s discovered. And that\u2019s an\r\ninteresting approach to the Snowden story in and of itself. In the days\r\nafter the whistleblowing, and even today, many people still want to villainize Snowden as a traitor. It\u2019s not surprising that Stone doesn\u2019t feel\r\nthat way, but what I like about the film is how deeply he works to humanize\r\nsomeone who has become a symbol for US privacy invasion and the need for\r\ntransparency. Working with a very identifiable actor, Stone is careful\r\nto keep this story specific. To be honest, that\u2019s been a gift of his for years,\r\nmaking sure he doesn\u2019t lose the human story of people like Ron Kovic or Jim Garrison\r\nas he\u2019s simultaneously painting a bigger picture. It\u2019s good to have him back at\r\nthe canvas.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Dumb: The Story of Big Brother Magazine", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cDumb: The Story of Big Brother Magazine\u201d is a heartfelt ode to a pioneering magazine in the \u201890s that recognized that skateboarding culture was about much more than just doing tricks or having the coolest art on your board. Built as a counter to traditional skateboard mags like Thrasher, Big Brother gave birth to a gonzo worldview that would eventually lead to the creation of MTV\u2019s\u201cJackass,\u201d which included several of the reporters from the publication and wildly influenced all of pop culture. For a documentary about form-breaking artists, the film is surprisingly straightforward, following a bit too much of a \u201cthen this happened\u201d structure, but there\u2019s an undeniable likability to these memories of barely-contained anarchy that should satisfy both those who remember Big Brother and people who have never heard of it. The film premieres on Hulu tomorrow, June 3rd. Advertisement In much the same way that \u201cDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead\u201d chronicled the rise and fall of National Lampoon through the memories of the key players involved in the magazine, \u201cDumb\u201d charts the history of Big Brother and its \u201chigh-functioning pieces of shit.\u201d At first, Big Brother was a more anarchic alternative to straightforward skateboarding magazines, but then it began to stray from even its base subject matter. As someone says in the doc, \u201cYou can\u2019t write about skateboarding, who gives a fuck?\u201d So, it became a magazine about the culture, mostly joking and playful and risk-taking. Sure, there\u2019d be some cool photos of skateboarders doing tricks but there would also be joke articles like when they took Slayer to Disneyland, covered a skating event by just hanging with a homeless girl nearby, and pulled various pranks on staff members.\u00a0Big Brother also contained copious amounts of two things that its target demo, young men, care deeply about: boobs and drugs. It was the law-breaking elements of Big Brother that would often get it in trouble. They did a spoof of \u201cHow To\u201d articles about how to kill yourself that got some national attention, and even produced a \u201cKids Issue\u201d (note: no apostrophe\u2014not for kids but about kids) that really made people angry as it interviewed skateboarding kids about whether or not they would have sex with their mothers to be better skaters or if they knew what a scrotum was. The interesting thing is that none of these controversies took them down. In fact, Larry Flynt would buy the magazine, and publish it under his label until skateboarding basically became too popular in the \u201800s again for a counter-culture magazine to survive\u2014it was culture-culture.  Patrick O'Dell's film assembles all the major players for a series of interviews, including the main voices behind the magazine like Jeff Tremaine and Chris Pontius, as well as the players who would break off and form \u201cJackass\u201d like Johnny Knoxville and Steve-O, whose first appearance in the magazine included the caption \u201cSteve-O is pathetic,\u201d in a story about him lighting his head on fire. The best of the stories have the feel of a group of friends sitting around at a party, reminiscing about the most memorable moments of their lives over a few beers. It's almost worth watching just for the shattered look on Spike Jonze's face as he speaks about the bit he can never forget: the Poocano. Advertisement Big Brother never made a lot of money\u2014it was losing it before Flynt bought it\u2014but it was formally groundbreaking. I love that the issues would each have a different structure and often a different size in those early days. One even came in a cereal box. That kind of publishing playfulness is gone in an era of YouTube in which everything is delivered in the same format. The best elements of \u201cDumb\u201d get at how these guys weren\u2019t just morons having fun\u2014they were artistic, creative, and funny. Jonah Hill even stops by to give the Big Brother team credit for forming his sense of humor. Having said that, \u201cDumb\u201d is pretty traditional when it comes to form, and it disappointingly rushes through its final chapters, quickly mentioning \u201cJackass\u201d and then the unexpected end of the magazine. I wanted to know more about how the skateboarding culture changed after Big Brother and how we still see its influence in it today, and more about where the key players are now. I guess Big Brother ended with its fans wanting more, but the movie didn\u2019t have to as well.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "I Origins", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cIf scientific\r\nanalysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be\r\nfalse, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims.\u201d\u2014Dalai\r\nLama XIV The conflict between science and religion, fact and faith\r\nhas been a starting point for great fiction for centuries. Mike Cahill, the\r\nwriter/director of \u201cAnother Earth\u201d and \u201cI Origins,\u201d is fascinated with where\r\nthese seemingly diametrically opposed viewpoints conflict or, more\r\ninterestingly, intersect. Can we be scientific and faithful? Can we believe in\r\nforces beyond our control even as we live in a world increasingly fascinated\r\nwith explaining how everything works? With \u201cI Origins,\u201d Cahill takes this\r\ninternal conflict common in so many people and pegs something of a Puzzle Movie\r\non to it as one science-minded man experiences that which he cannot explain\r\nwith traditional reason. It is a film that can sometimes frustrate in its supporting characters\u00a0but Cahill\r\nand his talented cast are unapologetically willing to explore the kind of\r\ncomplex intangibles that filmmakers often ignore or merely turn into\r\npretentious drivel.  Advertisement Dr. Ian Grey (Michael Pitt) is obsessed with the human eye,\r\none of the elements of biology that makes us unique and that religions around\r\nthe world have used as proof of the Divine Creator. We all have eye biometrics\r\nthat are specific to us, and various cultures have viewed the eye as a window\r\nto the soul or even the thumbprint of a creator. Grey wants to get to the\r\nbottom of the evolution of the eye, working with colleagues Kenny (Steven Yeun)\r\nand Karen (Brit Marling). Then he meets a model whose eyes essentially take him\r\nemotional prisoner. At a party, Ian has a sexy encounter with a mostly masked\r\nwoman named Sofi (Astrid Berg\u00e8s-Frisbey) and can\u2019t stop thinking about her. He\r\nfinds himself pushed by fate or destiny to a billboard of her unforgettable\r\neyes, eventually tracking Sofi down and beginning a passionate romance with the\r\nwoman who will change his life. While the preview for \u201cI Origins\u201d gives away\r\nalmost the entire film, we\u2019ll stop the plot synopsis here\u2014it\u2019s better if you\r\ndon\u2019t know much\u2014but Ian\u2019s relationship with Sofi sends him down a very\r\ndifferent path than the scientific one on which he began. \u201cI Origins\u201d is a film\r\nabout how destiny and love can lead us to different revelations than we could\r\nhave possibly reached without them. Anyone who has known love can attest to its\r\nability to forever alter a charted course and Cahill\u2019s emotionally raw approach\r\nto filmmaking gets to the truth of that in a memorable way. It\u2019s also a remarkably confident film technically. Cinema\r\nhas had a love affair with the eye for a century now and Cahill and\r\ncinematographer Markus F\u00f6rderer take the timeless image of the eye and give it\r\nemotional resonance in the way they use it, balancing the film's two equally important halves. Cahill and his technical team\r\nwisely ground their film, only occasionally allowing it flights of visual\r\nfancy. We spend more time with Ian and Karen in a lab than we do in existential\r\npursuit of a greater purpose. And that makes the film\u2019s more extremely philosophical\r\nthemes forgivable. Cahill's work here is a notable technical advancement over \"Another Earth,\" proving he's not just a filmmaker with big ideas but one who can pull them off with visual confidence as well. There's a flow in the cinematography and editing that carries us along, only occasionally becoming untethered to a pretentious degree. Cahill\u2019s smartest move was to not allow his film\u2019s \u201cbig\r\nissues\u201d to overwhelm the human story at its core. And he\u2019s helped notably by\r\nyet-another strong performance from Michael Pitt, an actor who has shown such\r\nrange just recently from his terrifying work on TV's \u201cHannibal\u201d to this relatable,\r\nlikable performance. Advertisement The film's biggest problem is that the two women in Ian\u2019s life aren\u2019t as well-drawn as they\r\ncould have been in a superior film. Sofi and Karen feel a bit too much like\r\nobvious opposites\u2014the \"spiritual model\" and the \"scientific technician.\" If both\r\ncharacters were allowed a bit more of their alternate, \u201cI Origins\u201d would have\r\nbeen a more interesting venture. For, in the end, it\u2019s a film that argues we\r\ndon\u2019t live in a world of science OR faith but one in which both will give us a\r\ndeeper understanding of who we are and where we\u2019re going.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Unsane", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cUnsane\u201d opens from the perspective of a stalker. We hear in voiceover how the object of his affection made him see the world in a completely new way. And make no mistake. This woman is an \u201cobject\u201d to this man, someone who does not have her own agency or reality outside of what she can do for him. We will later learn that the stalker is a man named David Strine (Joshua Leonard) and the woman is Sawyer Valentini (Claire Foy), whom he met while she was caring for David\u2019s father in his final days. He became obsessed with her because of the comfort she provided his father, and, by extension, David. In other words, she became an object that made him feel good and so he felt a truly one-sided connection, as they often are with stalkers. On the surface, \u201cUnsane\u201d is a potboiler, a routine stalker thriller. But it\u00a0works because of how much there is going on within that familiar structure, courtesy of Jonathan Bernstein & James Greer\u2019s smart script, Soderbergh\u2019s claustrophobic direction, and Claire Foy\u2019s committed lead performance. Advertisement Sawyer has been traumatized by her experience with David, and it\u2019s impacted her professional and personal life in a way that has made her seek treatment. She goes to a facility, tells her story, and fills out a few forms. Before she knows it, she\u2019s being asked to hand over her personal belongings and asked to strip. She\u2019s going to have to stay for at least 24 hours for observation. Of course, she freaks out, trying to get a hold of her mother (Amy Irving), and even calling the police. When she mistakes an orderly for her stalker and strikes him, her \u201csentence\u201d is increased to seven days. She meets a threatening patient named Violet (Juno Temple) and a supportive one named Nate (Jay Pharoah), who tells her that she\u2019s basically part of an insurance scam, in which hospitals like this one admit patients just to get money from their providers.    As if all of this wouldn\u2019t be nightmare enough, Sawyer is startled to see David handing out medication to the patients. At first, he claims to have no idea who Sawyer is, and her admissions of trauma allow those around her to easily disbelieve her claims that her stalker has infiltrated the hospital at which she\u2019s staying. There\u2019s a fascinating subtext that's woven through \"Unsane\"\u00a0about listening to women when they tell you something wrong. The first doctor that Sawyer goes to in a panic when she realizes she has to stay doesn\u2019t get off the phone right away to talk to her; an attorney that Sawyer\u2019s mother calls for help hangs up without waiting for questions or even saying goodbye; and even the new role in which Sawyer may or may not be seeing David is that of a controlling male: someone literally drugging the people under his care so they\u2019ll behave in the way they want him to. Without overplaying the gender dynamics in \u201cUnsane,\u201d Bernstein, Greer, and Soderbergh have something to say about controlling, unlistening, needy men. (And there\u2019s another commentary on the failure of our healthcare system that ties this work to \u201cLogan Lucky,\u201d which also undeniably had that theme.)    And they say it with a daring new visual style. \u201cUnsane\u201d was shot on an iPhone and has a crazy aspect ratio of 1.56:1. It\u2019s somewhere in between an old-fashioned full-frame ratio and a traditional widescreen, creating a boxy look that perfectly suits a film about someone who\u2019s essentially trapped. Once again, Soderbergh presents such a remarkable economy of visual language, as he does in almost all of his work. It doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a wasted shot here. (If anything, it feels like a few scenes could have used a bit more material.)\u00a0For the most part,\u00a0\u201cUnsane\u201d is lean and mean, giving you just what you need to stick with it. And the visual style has an immediacy that adds to the intensity, especially in early scenes when confusion reigns and most of all in a fantastic sequence that has already been called \u201cThe Blue Room Scene.\u201d It feels like a style that allows little room for traditional acting or production crutches, which places more weight on Foy\u2019s shoulders. She rises to the challenge with a complex, daring performance. She\u2019s great here.    Advertisement While Soderbergh does all he can to elevate the material, the final act doesn\u2019t land with the same weight as his best work as the script veers down a few roads that include a few too many plot holes and diminish the work overall. It's a bit frustrating to see \"Unsane\"\u00a0succumb to some traditional traps in the final scenes, especially after being so daring up to that point. Having said that, the first hour is so interesting, Foy is so good, and Soderbergh is so clearly still at the top of his game, that the relative failures of the climax can be forgiven.    After a brief retirement, Soderbergh has come roaring back with two very different films in \u201cLogan Lucky\u201d and \u201cUnsane.\u201d He\u2019s reportedly already submitted a cut of another movie, starring Andre Holland, to be released later this year, and he directed the series \u201cMosaic\u201d for smartphones and HBO. He\u2019s not only back, he\u2019s as active as he\u2019s ever been. And the film world is better for it.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Heal the Living", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Heal the Living\" starts with a wordless and lengthy opening sequence so dreamlike, so beautiful and meditative, that everything that follows\u2014and much follows\u2014is informed by it. Three teenage boys meet up before dawn to go surfing. They huddle together, zipping up their wet suits, and then plunge into the cold, heaving ocean. Waves surge up, and the boys bob on their surfboards, three dark heads against the blue. There is no urgent storytelling impulse at work, no \"let's get to the plot\" impatience. It is the moment that matters: the thrill of standing up on the board, the silence that accompanies challenging physical activity, and the beauty of the waves seen from underneath the surface. The fact that the morning ends in a tragic car accident, leaving one of the boys in a coma, just intensifies the memory of that opening sequence\u2014its vision of grace, strange beauty and the wonder of the momentary. Adapted from Maylis de Kerangal's 2014 novel, \"Heal the Living\" is director Katell Quill\u00e9v\u00e9r\u00e9's third feature, and shows her humane vision of the interconnectedness of humans and the fragile miracle of life. The plot comes straight out of any hospital-based episodic, but it's Quill\u00e9v\u00e9r\u00e9's approach that is so unique, and ultimately, so powerful. Advertisement As Simon (Gabin Verdet) lies in a coma, his estranged parents (Emmanuelle Seigner, Kool Shen) hover over him, brought together by trauma, bewildered at the disaster that has befallen them. The head surgeon (Bouli Lanners) informs them that their son is brain-dead, and gently reminds a new nurse (Monia Chokri) that the parents need to get used to the fact that their son is no longer \"there.\" Tahar Rahim plays the organ donor consultant at the hospital, used to guiding grieving parents towards their terrible decision with the delicacy and gentleness required. The \"story\" is not the main thing. It's how the story is told that matters. Small details emerge. The head surgeon listens to hip-hop in his car and makes his staff do fist-bumps instead of hand-shakes. The organ donor watches YouTube videos of goldfinches in his office to unwind. In an absolutely extraordinary moment, the new nurse\u2014who has a hickey on her neck (another nurse teases her about it)\u2014loses herself in a fantasy for the five seconds when she's alone in the elevator. In Quill\u00e9v\u00e9r\u00e9's hands, nobody is peripheral. As Simon's parents wrestle with their decision, another narrative emerges, traveling on its own separate track until it merges with the first. A former musician named Claire (Anne Dorval) and her two college-age sons (Finnegan Oldfield and Theo Cholbi) sit in an apartment together, across from a hospital. The texture of their relationship is sensitively drawn, shown in eloquent fragments, the three of them curled up in bed together watching \"E.T.,\" the boys nervously solicitous of her, old beyond their years, but childlike in how they cuddle with their mother. Claire has a degenerative heart disease, and the three of them are waiting for news of a possible heart transplant. Quill\u00e9v\u00e9r\u00e9 allows the story to tell itself, gently, slowly, no pushing, no obvious prioritizing. Because in such a life-or-death situation, the only priority is the moment. There can be no other. Through the merging rivers of these two narratives is Quill\u00e9v\u00e9r\u00e9's devotion to how each small world glimpsed operates: how the organ donation team works, the\u00a0midnightflights carrying ice-packed organs, the white board filled with possible recipients and donors, the almost balletic ritual of surgery preparation, the last-minute phone calls, the good-byes. It's a presentation of the tapestry of devoted human beings required to move a beating heart from one body to another, the end of one life, to (hopefully) the new beginning of another. If you take such things for granted, \"Heal the Living\" asks that you stop for a second, and give thanks to those who know how to perform such a miracle. We may have seen this all before, but not in this particular way. Every moment is treated with care. Nothing is manipulated to \"up\" the emotional response in the audience. It's not necessary. Advertisement The film is scored by the great Alexandre Desplat, and the music expresses the tension, melancholy and urgency of these momentous events in the characters' lives. It acts as connective tissue between the narratives. Tom Harari's cinematography is fluid and flexible: there are moments of sweeping startling movement, like in the opening as the camera follows Simon riding through the streets on his bike, careening around corners, the freedom and exhilaration of youth, and then there are moments of stillness, the camera capturing flickers of thought and emotion on a person's face. This is deeply human filmmaking. Most people have had the experience of looking around at strangers on a crowded street, in a train station, or on a bus, and thinking, \"I wonder what struggles that person over there may be going through in their life.\" \"I wonder what burden that man may be enduring.\" \"I wonder what that woman smiling to herself is thinking about.\" Seeing other human beings as real\u2014as three-dimensional\u2014even when you don't know them\u2014is hard to do sometimes. It's so hard not to get caught up in yourself, in your own perception and point of view. \"Heal the Living\" knows that everyone is real, that life is real. It's what connects us all.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Grand Seduction", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Hop in the Way-Back Machine with me, boys and girls, as we revisit the late nineties. There\u00a0was still a thriving art house scene. Theaters that fit the description made a sizable percentage of their income showing films that weren't capital-A Art\u2014at least not in the sense that \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Last Year at Marienbad\" and \"The Exterminating Angel\" were capital-A art\u2014but were nonetheless witty and handsomely produced, with a generous heart that Hollywood films tended to lack. These small-a art house films had a very mild international flavor. They often starred unknown or barely-known young actors backed by a murderer's row of experienced character actors. A whole subset were about the same thing: people whose old way of life had been destroyed reinventing themselves. \"Billy Elliott,\" \"The Full Monty,\" \"Waking Ned Devine,\" \"Brassed Off,\" and other hits all fit this description.\u00a0There were just enough to prompt a backlash by certain cinephiles. They griped that the art houses should be reserved for challenging stuff, not films you could take your grandma to see after church or temple or brunch or whatever. \u00a0 Advertisement At some point in the aughts, this mini-wave of movies broke and rolled back. But every now and then you come across another, and at the risk of sounding like somebody who's given up on a certain fight\u2014if indeed this subject were worth fighting over\u2014I can say that I'm usually grateful to see a new one. I miss these sorts of films: mid-level indies that are formulaically constructed but filled with astute details, striking scenery, and well rounded characters living in reality. \"The Grand Seduction,\" about a Newfoundland fishing town mounting a wild scheme to draw a petroleum factory, is a film in this vein. It's a remake of \"Seducing Doctor Lewis,\" a French Canadian movie I haven't seen but that I'm told is pretty much the same. The excellent Canadian actor and filmmaker Don McKellar directed; it's his first feature in over a decade.\u00a0Brendan Gleeson plays the main character, Murray. (Cue the entire world shouting, \"I'm in!\")\u00a0 In an opening voice-over, the hero laments that his harbor town has been left behind. The fishing business is dead. Once proud anglers cash welfare checks and drink.\u00a0One day Murray finds himself in the position to do something, and rises to the occasion with a preposterous scheme. (It'll be familiar to anybody who's seen a certain late-'80s Chevy Chase film that I won't name, just in case you haven't.)\u00a0The town has been on the verge of luring a petroleum byproducts factory for years, but hasn't been able to close the deal because the company requires that the town have at least 250 adult inhabitants and a full-time doctor with hospital privileges. Murray hears about a young American physician named Paul Lewis (Taylor Kitsch) who's been waylaid on his way home to Los Angeles from a cricket tournament after airport security discovered cocaine in his luggage. The doc has to spend a month in Canada until his case is resolved. Murray gets him to spend his time in the town, figuring that if they can all join forces to make the place seem like an Eden built for Lewis' personal needs, he'll decide to stay, and they'll be able to land the factory. \"The Grand Seduction\" doesn't waste any time getting into the nitty-gritty of the town's deception. Its details are marvelously eccentric, verging on the early 21st century equivalent of a Preston Sturges farce. They begin by pretending they're all obsessed with lacrosse, and enlisting a seamstress to throw together cricket uniforms from available swatch of white or off-white fabric, including tablecloths and curtains, and stage a \"championship game\" atop a rocky cliff in view of the doctor's approaching boat. The scheme grows more complex by the day. There are aspects of illegal surveillance (the guest house where the doctor is staying is bugged), mass roleplaying (residents fake interest in cricket and the doctor's favorite music, jazz) and, ahem, procurement (Murray keeps pressuring the local postal worker,\u00a0Liane Balaban's Kathleen, to make Paul fall in love with her, but she won't because she finds him shallow and cocky and doesn't appreciate being used that way). Because Paul is culturally dislocated and missing his fiancee in Los Angeles, he never catches onto the fact that he's being played, and crudely at that. Advertisement This might read as a description of an insufferably broad film that's trying way too hard. Somehow it doesn't play like that. Why? Maybe it's because McKellar, adapting screenwriters Ken Scott and Michael Dowse and his ensemble cast favor subtlety. The actors put across funny bits with a deadpan reaction or awkward pause, instead of hammering them home by indulging in double takes or hitting key words hard. Gleeson in particular has an uncanny ability to wring laughs from lines that, on paper, aren't innately funny, by delivering them as if they were just another thing to say. When Murray calls a town meeting by exclaiming \"Hear ye, goddamnit, hear ye!\" or presents the fundamentals of cricket to his fellow townspeople by intoning, \"It is your civic duty to study these rules,\" or innocently inquires of Paul, \"Will ya be needin' any cocaine? We're down wit' it,\" you're watching a master actor teach a less-is-more class. The other actors are attuned to Gleeson's wavelength. I'm still chuckling at the memory of Paul's crusty pal Simon, played by the great Gordon Pinsent, explaining that watching cricket is \"like watching baseball, only longer.\" Kitsch's role is thankless\u2014Paul is all befuddlement and, in the film's later stage, heartbreak\u2014but he fully commits. The moments when Paul earnestly compliments folks who've been deceiving him for weeks have a perverse edge, because the townspeople don't seem to feel too guilty about the ruse. It's about reviving a nearly dead town; the doctor is but a means to that end. The filmmaking errs on the side of minimalism as well. One of the biggest laughs comes not from a line of dialogue, but a transition: Murray learns that Paul lost his dad at a young age, and we cut from a closeup of Murray thinking to a shot of Murray and Paul fishing together.\u00a0 For a supposedly feather-light comedy, \"The Grand Seduction\" is unusually interested in the fate of traditional labor in a cruel global economy. The town's deception of Paul has a metaphorical dimension\u2014all over the world, communities are rejecting their proud pasts and adopting new identities to survive\u2014but it's one that's never emphasized at the expense of laughs and sentiment. The toughness of the plot's resolution surprised me. We don't find out that the oil people are basically decent at heart, nor does the film congratulate itself for siding with the down-to-earth folks in the fishing village. The movie's wise enough to realize that a community that needs jobs often doesn't have the luxury of disapproving of whoever's holding the checkbook. It's more of a jump/how high situation. This is a contrived and formulaic movie, and the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense if you think about it for longer than five seconds. But it's graceful and sweet and wise where it counts, and often brilliantly acted, and it made me laugh. If I rated movies based purely on originality, I'd give \"The Grand Seduction\" two stars, maybe. The extra star is for the pleasure it gave me. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Magic Mike XXL", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "I wish there were a word for \"experimental fluff,\" because that's what \"Magic Mike XXL\" is. It's a new kind of critic-proof movie. You could rightly describe it as \"two hours of Channing Tatum and other hunky guys bonding, flirting with women, and doing bump-and-grind dance routines\" and not be wrong, and yet it's made with such aesthetic playfulness that I expect it to generate graduate theses with titles like, \"Breakaway Pantomimes: 'Magic Mike' and Commodified Desire.\"\u00a0 The film is directed by Gregory Jacobs, a longtime assistant director to \"Magic Mike\" director Steven Soderbergh,\u00a0and\u00a0co-produced by Soderbergh, who also shot and edited the movie under pseudonyms. It's\u00a0quite deliberately\u00a0about as close to a non-movie as a movie can be while still calling itself a movie. At times it feels like the beefiest and least douchebro-pandering episode of \"Entourage\" ever. Tatum's Mike and the remaining Kings of Tampa\u2014Ken (Matt Bomer), Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan (Kevin Nash), Tito (Adam Rodriguez)\u2014pile into a yogurt truck and drive to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to compete at a strippers' convention. \"We\u00a0got a tsunami of dollar bills to get to, daddy,\" exclaims Mike, in a tone that makes it sound as though they're about to storm the beach at Normandy. Advertisement That's all there is in\u00a0the\u00a0way of story. And this is by design. \"Magic Mike XXL\" is what your English teacher would call a picaresque narrative, or perhaps a comic epic. Mike is the captain of the S.S. Bananahammock, trying to lead his crew of gyrators and lady-pleasurers toward one last big, long, wide\u00a0hurrah, before they go their separate ways and join the \"respectable\" world. They're rock-hard, oiled-up sailors, the truck is their vessel, the American South is their river or perhaps their wine-dark sea.\u00a0The film could have been titled \"Homeboy's Odyssey,\" or \"Beestunglips Now.\" All that's missing is narration by Mike,\u00a0periodically\u00a0interrupted by drags on a joint and moments where he tries to remember what point he was trying to make. En route to Myrtle Beach, Mike and company go places and meet\u00a0people and have (often comically) erotic adventures. These set pieces feel geographically self-contained, as if every nightclub or private home were sequestered on its own island. The boys visit a gay strip club and somewhat lackadaisically compete onstage, then unwind at an all-night beach party. They stop by a next-generation strip club run by Mike's old flame Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith), who styles herself as a goddess-queen of desire, overseeing a mostly black male crew of strippers catering to a predominantly black female clientele. At one point the Kings drop in at a woodland house that looks a bit like a former plantation and interrupt a party of middle-aged ladies, hosted by Andie MacDowell (of Soderbergh's \"sex, lies, and videotape\"); when she mentions that she's only ever had sex with one man in her life, her husband, you just know that one of Mike's guys will help her out with that. (The guest is supposed to give the host a gift, y'all!) We learn via expository dialogue that Mike's old boss and mentor Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) left the group (which I guess is code for, \"McConaughey wanted too much money\"), and that Mike retired from stripping three years ago and poured his energy into his\u00a0furniture business and proposed to what's-her-name in the first film and was rejected. There's a new what's-her-name in \"XXL\"\u2014actually a\u00a0tattooed, glum, sarcastic photographer named Zoe (Amber Heard), who keeps reappearing at various stages of the strippers' journey; but she has as little chemistry with Mike here as Cody Horn's Brooke did in the first picture. When a series about a handsome and charming male stripper serves up two dud love stories in a row, you have to assume it's intentional\u2014that the films are genuflecting to the idea of including a \"love\u00a0interest,\" but not trying too hard to make a convincing one, because it might interfere in with the films' true, great, ongoing romance, between the audience's eyeballs and Channing Tatum's body.\u00a0 Advertisement To that end: where the first \"Mike\" confined nearly all its numbers to strip clubs, this one brings the routines into the wider world, creating something poised between a low-budget, semi-realistic road picture (full of quiet, sometimes flabby scenes of dudes hanging out and busting each other's chops) and one of those old-fashioned musicals where singing and dancing could just suddenly happen, at any time, for any reason. There's are solos set in Mike's workshop and at a gas station convenience store, and a couple numbers that are more song than dance (courtesy of Bomer and new cast member Donald Glover, aka rapper Childish Gambino as well as Troy on \"Community\"). The final act of \"XXL\", set at the stripper convention, almost departs from \"realism\" entirely. It amounts to a self-contained concert film that gives all of the guys their own solo numbers. Soderbergh, shooting as \"Peter Andrews,\" lets the camera glide up and down on cranes as if we were watching Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse rather than jockstrapped hunks grinding and diving and flipping and dry-humping\u2014and not only is that OK, it's sort of awesome. Smith presides over this section of the film as if auditioning to play the Emcee in the next Broadway production of \"Cabaret.\" She even has a Fosse fedora that complements her Tony Manero suit. Does the movie work? Intermittently, sometimes brilliantly. Reid Carolin's script features plenty of talk about the importance of appreciating and creating beauty for its own sake, as well as the invigorating properties of orgasms and sexual spectatorship and sensual indulgence, and the necessity of men listening to women and worshiping them like royalty. There are points when Mike and the gang are characterized as sexual deliverers, angels of mercy, or some such, and the movie is really not kidding about any of it, even when (especially when) Mike is talking about how much he loves cookies. \"Any god worth believing in sends you dudes in thongs when in need,\" Zoe tells Mike sarcastically, in a scene where the boys really did show up out of nowhere and make women's lives better just by being so damned sexayyyyy.\u00a0 The best parts of \"XXL\"\u2014the \"dance\" numbers that go on and on\u2014have the funny-intoxicating feel of a reverie. The second-best parts parts play\u2014as weird as this sounds\u2014like a minor Robert Altman film that's more atmospheric than exciting and that takes great care to get accents and regional details right; something like \"Cookie's Fortune\" or \"The Company\" or \"Dr. T. and the Women,\" maybe. The leading actresses\u2014Smith, MacDowell, and Elizabeth Banks as a stripper convention administrator\u2014have a spark here that they're rarely allowed to show in other roles, mainly because the filmmakers have encouraged them to be joyous and lustful. (MacDowell's \"Day-YUMMMMM!\" will be my ringtone soon.) Advertisement It's enough to make you wish the filmmakers had thought harder about what they were saying and doing, or trying to say and do, and made sure every part of the film felt frothy but controlled rather than aimless and half-assed, which unfortunately is a problem in a lot of \"XXL.\" There are some germs of themes bopping around in the margins, mostly having to do with gender politics and race-mixing in the new South (apparently Rome's nickname for Mike was White Chocolate) and the mainstream heterosexual appropriation of images and attitudes that were once deemed fringe. I miss McConaughey's mad-eyed commitment, I wish the gay strip club scene didn't feel perfunctory, and I wish more guys in the main cast besides Tatum were great, as opposed to adequate, dancers. (\"So You Think You Can Dance\" star Twitch has a nearly wordless supporting role, but gets a showpiece number with Tatum at the end.)\u00a0 But having attended a screening where hundreds of people applauded at their first glimpse of Tatum's back and shoulders, I know full well that almost no one who pays to see \"Magic Mike XXL\" will miss that other stuff. This is a two-and-a-half star picture, bumped up to three because it's so structurally and tonally unusual, and so likable, but if you're mainly looking to watch nearly naked guys dance, it's four stars, maybe five, or ten, depending. Box offices should brace for a tsunami of dollar bills.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Wolf of Wall Street", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Martin Scorsese's \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is abashed and shameless, exciting and exhausting, disgusting and illuminating; it's one of the most entertaining films ever made about loathsome men. Its star Leonardo DiCaprio has compared it to the story of the Roman emperor Caligula, and he's not far off the mark.\u00a0 Adapted by Terence Winter from the memoir by stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who oozed his way into a fortune in the 1980s and '90s, this is\u00a0an excessive film about excess, and a movie about appetites whose own appetite for compulsive pleasures seems bottomless. It runs three hours, and was reportedly cut down from four by Scorsese's regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker. It's a testament to Scorsese and Winter and their collaborators that one could imagine watching these cackling swine for five hours, or ten, while still finding them fascinating, and our own fascination with them disturbing. This is a reptilian brain movie. Every frame has scales.\u00a0 Advertisement The middle-class, Queens-raised Belfort tried and failed to establish himself on Wall Street in a more traditional way\u2014we see his tutelage in the late '80s at a blue chip firm, under the wing of a grinning sleazeball played by Matthew McConaughey\u2014but got laid off in the market crash of 1987. He reinvented himself on Long Island by taking over a penny stock boiler room and giving it an old money name, Stratton Oakmont, to gain the confidence of middle- and working-class investors. Per Wikipedia, at its peak, \"the firm employed over\u00a01000 stock brokers and was involved in stock issues totaling more than $1 billion, including an equity raising for footwear company\u00a0Steve Madden Ltd.\" Belfort and his company specialized in \"pump and dump\" operations: artificially blowing up the value of a nearly worthless stock, then selling it at a big profit, after which point the value drops and the investors lose their money. Belfort was indicted in 1998 for money laundering and securities fraud, spent nearly two years in federal prison and was ordered to pay back $110 million to investors he'd deceived.\u00a0 Taking its cues from gangster pictures, \"Wolf\" shows how Belfort rose from humble origins, becoming rich and notorious (the title comes from an unflattering magazine profile that caught the attention of federal prosecutors). This Robin Hood-in-reverse builds himself a team of merry men drawn from various sundry corners of his life. All have both given names and Damon Runyon-esque nicknames:\u00a0Robbie Feinberg, aka \"Pinhead\" (Brian Sacca),\u00a0Alden Kupferberg, aka \"Sea Otter\" (Henry Zebrowski), the dreadfully-toupeed \"Rugrat\"\u00a0Nicky Koskoff (P.J. Byrne), \"The Depraved Chinaman\" Chester Ming (Kenneth Choi), and Brad Bodnick (Shane Bernthal of \"The Walking Dead\"), a DeNiro-esque neighborhood hothead who's known as the Quaalude King of Bayside. His office enforcer is his volcanic dad (Rob Reiner), who screams about expenditures and workplace sleaze, but often seems to live vicariously through the trading floor's young wolves. Belfort's right hand man Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) is perhaps even more conscienceless than Belfort: a hefty wiseass with gleaming choppers who quits his job at a diner after one conversation with the hero, joins his scheme, helps him launder money, and introduces him to crack\u2014as if Belfort didn't have enough intoxicants in his system, on top of the adrenaline he generates by making deals and bedding every halfway attractive woman who crosses his path. As McConaughey's character tells Belfort early on, this subset of investing is so scummy that drugs are mandatory: \"How the f\u2014 else would you do this job?\" At one point a broker declares that they're doing all that coke and all those Quaaludes and guzzling all that booze \"in order to stimulate our freethinking ideas.\"\u00a0 Advertisement Belfort is married when the tale begins, to a good and respectable woman who doesn't approve of his financial shenanigans or chronic infidelity, but he soon throws her over for a blond and curvy trophy named Naomi LaPaglia (Australian actress Margot Robbie), then marries her and starts supporting her in the style to which they've both become accustomed. After a few years, Belfort is living in a mansion that another DiCaprio character, Jay Gatsby, might find gaudy, and buying a yacht, and helicoptering to and from meetings and parties while drugged out of his mind. Then a federal prosecutor named Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) enters the picture, sweating Belfort by confronting him on his own turf (including Belfort's yacht) and letting him brag on his own awesomeness until he hangs himself. Imagine the last thirty minutes of \"GoodFellas\" stretched out to three hours. That's the pace of this movie, and the feel of it. It's one damned thing after another: stock fraud and money laundering; trips to and from Switzerland to deposit cash in banks (and give the increasingly wasted Belfort a chance to flirt with his wife's British aunt, played by \"Absolutely Fabulous\" costar Joanna Lumley); rock-and-pop driven montages with ostentatious film speed shifts (including a slow-motion Quaalude binge); and some daringly protracted and seemingly half-improvised dialogue scenes that feel like tiny one-act plays. The best of these is McConaughey's only long scene as Belfort's mentor Mark Hanna, who at one point thumps a drum pattern on his chest while rumble-singing a la Bobby McFerrin; this eventually becomes the anthem of Belfort's firm, and it's weirdly right, as it suggests a tribal war song for barbarians on permanent rampage.\u00a0 As is often the case in Scorsese's films, \"Wolf\" gives alpha male posturing the attraction-repulsion treatment, serving up the drugging and whoring and getting-over as both spectacle and cautionary tale. In his most exuberant performance since \"Titanic,\" DiCaprio plays Belfort as a pipsqueak Mussolini of the trading floor, a swaggering jock who pumps his guys up by calling them \"killers\" and \"warriors\" and attracts hungry, self-destructive women, partly via brashness and baby-faced good looks, but mostly by flashing green. The film lacks the mild distancing that Scorsese brought to \"GoodFellas\" and \"Casino.\" The former contrasted Henry Hill's matter-of-fact narration with occasionally shocked reactions to bloodshed; \"Casino\" adopted a Stanley Kubrick-like chilly detachment, as if everyone involved were narrating from a cloud in Heaven or a pit in Hell. \"Wolf\" is\u00a0in the thick of things at all times, to suffocating effect, depriving the viewer of moral anchors.\u00a0 Advertisement This is not the same thing as saying that the film is amoral, though. It's not. It's disgusted by this story and these people and finds them grotesque, often filming them from distorted angles or in static wide shots that make them seem like well-dressed animals in lushly decorated terrariums.\u00a0 You can tell how much Belfort cares about his people by the way his narration segues from an anecdote about a broker who fell into a spiral of misery and shame: \"He got depressed and killed himself three years later,\" Belfort says over a photo of a corpse in a bathtub trailing blood from slit wrists. Then, without missing a beat, he says, \"Anyway...\" The brokers classify prostitutes by cost and attractiveness, referring to them as \"blue chips, \"NASDAQs\" and \"pink sheets\" (or \"skanks\"); they're warm-blooded receptacles to be screwed and sent on their way, much like the firm's clients, including shoe mogul Steve Madden, whose deal Belfort describes as an oral rape. The directorial high point is a Belfort-Azoff Quaalude binge that spirals into comic madness, with Azoff blubbering and freaking out and stuffing his face and collapsing, and Belfort suffering paralysis during a panicked phone call about his money and then crawling towards his car like a nearly-roadkilled animal, one agonizing inch at a time.\u00a0 These images of censure and humiliation\u2014and there are a lot of them, including a gif-worthy moment of Belfort paying a prostitute to stick a lit candle in his bum\u2014coexist with moments that get off on the men's howling and profit-making and chest-thumping. We're supposed to figure out how we feel about the mix of modes, and accept that if there were no appeal whatsoever to this kind of behavior, no one would indulge in it. This isn't wishy-washy. It's honest. Scorsese and Winter never lose track of the bigger picture.\u00a0In theory, the movie's subject is the Wall Street mentality, which is just a clean-scrubbed version of the gangster mentality showcased in Scorsese's \"Mean Streets,\" \"GoodFellas\" and \"Casino\" (one could make a case that guys like Belfort are the ones who pushed the Vegas mob out of Vegas). \"Wolf\" starts with a Fellini-like party on the floor of Belfort's firm, then freeze-frames on Belfort tossing a dwarf at a huge velcro target, literally and figuratively abusing the Little Guy. The traders get away with their abuse because most people don't see themselves as little guys, but as little guys who might some day become the big guy doing the tossing. \"Socialism never took root in America,\" John Steinbeck wrote, \"because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as\u00a0temporarily embarrassed millionaires.\u201d Belfort chides the prosecutor Denham for living what Henry Hill would have called the goody-two-shoes life, and in a scene near the end, as Denham rides the subway home, we can see that the taunt stuck in his craw.\u00a0Everyone at Belfort's firm seems to have the same title: \"senior vice-president.\" Everybody wants to rule the world. But the film's vision goes beyond cultural anthropology and antihero worship. When people ask me what the film is about, I tell them that like a good many films by Scorsese\u2014who overcame a cocaine problem in the early '80s\u2014at its root, it's about addiction: a disease or condition that seizes hold of one's emotions and imagination, and makes it hard to picture any life but the one you're already in.\u00a0Many people get a contact high from following the exploits of entrepreneurs, financiers, bankers, CEO and the like, and when such men (they're nearly always men) get busted for skirting or breaking laws, they root for them as if they were disreputable folk heroes, gangsters with fountain pens instead of guns\u2014guys who, for all their selfishness and cruelty, are above the petty rules that constrict the rest of us. Such men are addicts, egged on by a cheering section of little guys who fantasize of being big. We enable them by reveling in their exploits or not paying close enough attention to their misdeeds, much less demanding reform of the laws they bend or ignore\u2014laws that might have teeth if we hadn't allowed guys like Belfort (and his far more powerful role models) to legally bribe the United States legislative branch via the nonsensical \"system\" of campaign financing.\u00a0After a certain number of decades, we should ask if the nonstop enabling of addicts like Belfort doesn't mean that, in some sense, their enablers are addicted, too\u2014that they (we) are part of a perpetual-motion wheel that just keeps turning and turning.\u00a0In the end \"Wolf\" is not so much about one addict as it is about America's addiction to capitalist excess and the \"He who dies with the most toys wins\" mindset, which has proved as durable as the image of the snarling gangster taking what he likes when he feels like taking it.\u00a0 Advertisement Scorsese and Winter aren't shy about drawing connections between Belfort's crew and the thugs in Scorsese's mob pictures. Those mob films are addiction stories, too. \u00a0\"Wolf of Wall Street\" showcases Belfort Henry Hill-style, as if he were an addict touring the wreckage of his life in order to confess and seek forgiveness; but like a lot of addicts, as Belfort recounts the disasters he narrowly escaped, the lies he told and the lives he ruined, you can feel the buzz in his voice and the adrenaline burning in his veins. You can tell he misses his old life of big deals and money laundering and decadent parties, just as Hill missed busting heads, jacking trucks, and doing enough cocaine to make Scarface's head explode.\u00a0 There will be a few points during \"Wolf\" when you think, \"These people are revolting, why am I tolerating this, much less getting a vicarious thrill from it?\" At those moments, think about what the \"it\" refers to. It's not just these characters, and this setting, and this particular story. It's the world we live in. Men like Belfort represent us, even as they're robbing us blind. They're America, and on some level we must be OK with them representing America, otherwise we would have seen reforms in the late '80s or '90s or '00s that made it harder for men like Belfort to amass a fortune, or that at least quickly detected and harshly punished their sins.\u00a0Belfort was never punished on a level befitting the magnitude of pain he inflicted. According to federal prosecutors, he failed to abide by the terms of his 2003 restitution agreement. He's a motivational speaker now, and if you read interviews with him, or his memoir, it's obvious that he's not really sorry about anything but getting caught.\u00a0We laugh at the movie, but guys like Belfort will never stop laughing at us.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Rupture", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "American writer/director Steven Shainberg is an uncompromisingly idiosyncratic filmmaker, which is one reason, I infer, that he\u2019s only made four features in a career that began in 1996. His commitment to pursuing his vision\u2014which, in part is invested in putting a highbrow gloss on what is generally considered genre material\u2014is entirely admirable in the abstract. It\u2019s in the material results department that things get dicey. His 1996 debut, \u201cHit Me,\u201d ostensibly adapted from a Jim Thompson novel, was one of the most laboriously pretentious and tedious noir variations of its decade. Shainberg did hit paydirt with 2002\u2019s \u201cSecretary,\u201d a dominance-and-submission tale that applied erotic-dimestore-paperback stylings to a Mary Gaitskill short story, and had career-high performances from James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal. 2006\u2019s \u201cFur\u201d misfired badly, ostentatiously applying overextended metaphor to a consideration of the life and art of Diane Arbus. Advertisement \u201cRupture\u201d is Shainberg\u2019s first film from his own original story, although said story contains a lot of familiar elements. Noomi Rapace plays Renee, a single mom of Canadian origin stuck in Middle America trying to do the best she can with a rebellious tween son and a terrifically unpleasant ex-husband. Early in the film, feeds from small video cameras show that Renee is under surveillance; a small device clamped on to one of her car\u2019s tires suggests even more sinister goings-on. Sure enough, a blowout sends Renee to the side of the road and also to a rather elaborately staged abduction, during which her face is wrapped in shiny black duct tape. Why shiny black, you may ask. Indeed. As it eventually becomes clear that Renee ought to be delivered to her captors in good health, the better for them to manipulate it, you\u2019d think that her handling might call for more actual care. But, you know, shiny black duct tape looks cool and threatening. Soon Renee is strapped down, hard, to a metal gurney, which makes a lot of metallic noises as she bangs her body against it. She\u2019s in a room with a triple-deadbolt lock that makes a neat \u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201d clang whenever it\u2019s shut. The lighting of the room is peach-purple and the walls look like rotting meat. The production design is a tired mix of clich\u00e9 and dink. A couple of seeming functionaries, played by Michael Chiklis and Lesley Manville, show up, don silly rubber goggled with extended lens holders, and phone in some menace. A fellow prisoner gibbers to Renee through a heating vent, mentioning something called \u201cG-ten-twelve-X.\u201d When she repeats the letters and numbers to her captors, one of them says \u201cIf you find out what that is then you\u2019ve made real progress.\u201d Curiouser and curiouser then\u2014if, as it happens, you wind up caring. This movie did not turn that trick for me. Eventually Renee does break free from the gurney, and goes crawling through the air vents, and witnesses the torture, physical and psychological, of the other presumable kidnap victims. Which goes on for what seems like 40 straight minutes (it\u2019s not, but it sure feels it) and is put into some kind of relief by the possibility that it\u2019s all being staged for Renee\u2019s benefit anyway. It\u2019s not involving; it\u2019s not scary; it\u2019s just kind of miserable. When the ultimate purpose of Renee\u2019s ordeal comes to light\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a spoiler to comment that it\u2019s like a self-empowerment seminar scripted by M. Night Shyamalan\u2014the compensation for the aforementioned misery seems scant indeed.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Big Sur", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "In 1960, three years after the publication of \"On the Road\", which made him a celebrity, Jack Kerouac was finding his fame wearying. He was pushing forty, and harassed by beatnik groupies who thought he had the answers to Life. He was a severe alcoholic. Fearful that he was losing his grip on his art, he went to stay in poet pal Lawrence Ferlinghetti's Big Sur cabin for a back-to-nature writing retreat. It didn't quite work out as planned, and the book that resulted, titled \"Big Sur\", is an excruciating howl of pain exacerbated by delirium tremens and restless anxiety that sometimes tipped into insanity. Written in Kerouac's typically honest stream-of-consciousness style, and owing much to James Joyce, \"Big Sur\" exists entirely inside the mind of a man going mad.  Advertisement Michael Polish's \"Big Sur\", starring Jean-Marc Barr of \"Dogville\" as Kerouac is a strangely tepid experience for such searing psychological material. The fault lies in the heavy reliance on voiceover (all taken from the book), which distances us from what is happening onscreen. Scenes are not allowed to unfold, to explode, to develop, to sit there, because the voiceover is too insistent, interjecting itself every other moment. What would have happened if the voiceover had been used more sparingly? What f the beautiful collage effect of Kerouac's time in the woods (the film is stunningly beautiful) had been allowed to develop on its own, leaving more room for interpretation, chaos, life? There are moments that are allowed to breathe, but they are few and far between.  The acting is all excellent, once you push past the voiceover that stands between you and the performances. Josh Lucas plays Neal Cassady (a brilliant casting choice). Anthony Edwards is excellent as Ferlinghetti, openly concerned about Kerouac's lifestyle and drinking, but fearful of being a nag about it. Kate Bosworth plays Billie, Neal's mistress, who is then passed off to Kerouac. There's a quiet moment (un-interrupted by voiceover) during a party at the Big Sur cabin when Cassady lays his head down on Kerouac's shoulder, an intimate and cuddly gesture. In the book, Kerouac writes of Cassady that he \"carries that strange apocalyptic burst of gold he somehow always manages to produce.\" Just by showing up, Josh Lucas embodies that magic, in both its elusive quality and its light-hearted sense that all things may still be possible, even after all of the disappointments.  The shots of Big Sur (M. David Mullen is the gifted cinematographer) woven throughout the film\u2014the billowing fog, the towering redwoods, the long line of crashing waves, the cloudy sky out to sea\u2014are magnificent as well as alienating. The visuals evoke a beauty so grand that we can never hope to enter into it. It is a beauty that is closed to Kerouac, a fact that he finds distressing. We see Kerouac sitting by the waves staring out to sea. We see him wading by the creek, we see him typing. He reads \"Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde\" by the fire, and, of course, over the course of the film his own split personality will crack open, revealing the abyss within. It is clear that there will be no coming back from Big Sur. Something died during his short time out there. He had less than 10 years left to live. Watching \"Big Sur\", you are amazed Kerouac lasted even that long.  The film is quite strong in its unblinking portrayal of alcoholism, depression, and mania, but it would have been stronger without a voice telling me over and over and over again how I was supposed to be feeling about it.

{"Title": "We the Parents", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "An illuminating moment occurs early on in \"We the Parents,\" a new documentary directed by James Takata about the first parents in California to utilize the new \"Parent Trigger\" Law, wherein if parents in a failing school district get enough signatures on a petition, they can request that their local school either close down or become a charter school. In December 2010, a group of parents in Compton, in southern Los Angeles County, presented a petition to Karen Frison, the Superintendent of that district. A swarm of news cameras and reporters push in on the two main figures \"starring\" in this historic moment. As she hands it over, the parent presenting the petition, visibly nervous, says, \"Because we care about our kids.\" Ms. Frison replies, kind but firm, \"We care about your kids, too.\"  Advertisement In that one simple exchange, the complexity of education reform is laid bare. \"We the Parents\" is pretty slight (only an hour long), and focuses only on the first Parent Trigger cases in California. At times it feels like a promotional video for Parent Revolution, the not-for-profit group that helps parents organize themselves and gather enough signatures to start the Parent Trigger process in motion. Some room is given to voices on the opposite side of the fence, but not enough. It is not a full picture. And teachers aren't represented at all in the film.  I come from a family filled with teachers, so perhaps the absence of teachers in the film is something that bothered me more than it should. Teachers are on the front lines every day, dealing with unimaginable stresses on the back end, not to mention low salaries and constant criticism from every direction. It would have been nice to hear how the teachers in Compton felt about what was happening in their school district.  It would be difficult to debate that we don't need educational reform in this country. And for parents like the ones we meet in \"We the Parents\", who live in notoriously terrible school districts, there isn't time to wait. Bureaucracy is slow and frustrating, and institutions are resistant to change. Meanwhile, as the statistics tell us in the film, in white letters on a black screen, \"less than 4% of kids in Compton qualify to apply to California state university.\" It is clearly an urgent situation.  Parent Revolution acts as the real \"trigger\" here, picking out schools to help, and, as Ben Austin, director of Parent Revolution, says, to help \"incentivize a revolt\" in the parents. (Austin has business-speak down cold.) Some of the parents in Compton are open to the organizers who come knocking on their door to talk about charter schools and petitions, and others say \"No, thanks.\" But over the course of a couple of months, enough signatures are gathered to present to the Superintendent. The petition then goes into the bureaucratic maze of School Boards and committees. The Parent Trigger Law is new, and nobody seems to know what the process really is. The people in Compton are the pioneers.  Advertisement Dr. Carl Cohn, a former superintendent, gives terrific background on Compton as a community, context that is necessary to understand the bitterness that is stirred up in the community as a result of the petition. Compton, as he says, \"feel(s) like they've been picked on by the media for years.\" The people who live there are sensitive to the image of their town as overrun by violence, drive-by shootings, and chaos.  So to have it touted in the media that their schools are the worst in the state, that there is a \"problem in Compton\" does not go over well. School Board meetings get hostile. Parent Revolution is pilloried in the local press and local radio.  One guy calls into a radio show and yells that Parent Revolution pretends it's a grass-roots organization when really it is \"funded by billionaires\"! Parent Revolution does not hide its funding sources, but one can certainly understand the resentment of Compton at being overrun by do-gooders, who all wear identical T-shirts saying \"I Am the Revolution.\"  Marty Hillerman, of the CA Federation of Teachers, is one of the few critical voices given space in the film. He says that this \"movement\" belittles teachers, and it is a mistake to assume that parents know better than people who have worked in education for decades. He criticizes Parent Revolution as a \"vehicle for some very rich people to found an organization and go into communities and disrupt them.\"  Emotions run high. The parents interviewed are sweet, sincere, and seem bowled over by the fact that they would have any power to enact change. Many of them are high school dropouts and want better for their kids. They can't move to a better school district. They want change locally. The pressure is on, because people like Matt Lauer and Brian Williams pontificate about what is happening on national news shows.  Cinematographer Milton Santiago shoots the streets of Compton in an emotional and simple way. There are myth-busting shots of nice houses with little lawns, girls doing cartwheels in the grass, people riding bikes. But there are also shots showing the economic devastation of the area: posters hollering \"I BUY SHORT SALES,\" furniture piled on the sidewalk, giant handwritten banners saying \"Put Compton Back 2 Work.\" Local churches often pick up the slack, providing space for people to meet and organize, as well as opening charter schools of their own.  Advertisement The petition put forth by the Compton parents is rejected, on what appears to be a technicality (the petitions had no dates on them). It is a disappointment. But other communities have followed Compton's lead. Parent Revolution is there, providing organizational help, buses to drive the parents to Sacramento to go to meetings at the State House, and, of course, lots and lots of T-shirts.  Little black-and-white cartoons give us funny visuals of how the Parent Trigger Law works, with petitions piling up on one side of a see-saw with a cute little school house on the other side. A stilted informational voiceover is used intermittently. While it is impossible to not sympathize with the parents in Compton and the other failing school districts, Marty Hillerman's words create a giant reverb in the film, one that is difficult to ignore.  Karen Frison, the superintendent who received the Compton petition in the scene starting off the film, says later on that the entire process has helped the school board in the district to \"re-think how we operate.\" That is a good thing. Bureaucracies can always try for a little bit more self-awareness. But when a parent stands up at a school board meeting and says, \"We just want what is best for our kids,\" it makes me think of A.O. Scott's words in his review for \"Won't Back Down\" (2012), based loosely on the Parent Trigger events in California: \"A movie that insists, repeatedly and at high volume, that 'it's all about the kids' might just cause you to wonder what else it is about, and this one is not shy about showing its ideological hand. Who, after all, could possibly be against kids?\"  Three new schools will open in different communities this month in California, as a result of the Parent Trigger Law, so time will tell if it will make a difference in students' test scores and achievement levels.  \"We the Parents,\" one-sided and promotional as it often feels, presents a possible solution, as well as the difficulties in achieving it.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Bachelor Weekend", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "John Butler\u2019s \"The Bachelor Weekend\" is a genial comedy with likable enough characters to get one through its modest running time and meager intentions but it succumbs to a few too many clich\u00e9s and paper-thin characterizations to fulfill its potential. Worst of all, it allows one larger-than-life character to steal too much focus and drag the narrative into a predictable arc we've seen so many times before: the boorish lout who breaks the more docile types out of their shells. There are emotional moments that are surprisingly effective (mostly thanks to the talents \"Sherlock\" star Andrew Scott), a few good laughs, and hints at the film that could have been with just a few rewrites. It\u2019s not quite a \"lost\" weekend, merely misplaced. Advertisement More accurately known as \"The Stag\" overseas, \"The Bachelor Weekend\" stars Hugh O\u2019Conor as Fionnan, the kind of sensitive groom-to-be who makes dioramas of his reception and serves as the main contact for the event\u2019s florist. Even the wedding planner calls him metrosexual. His fianc\u00e9e Ruth (Amy Huberman) asks Best Man Davin (Andrew Scott, Moriarty from \"Sherlock\") to organize a \"stag.\" Fionnan, Davin, and their best friends will hike the great outdoors, getting in touch with nature and themselves. Travelers include Fionnan\u2019s brother \"Little Kevin\" (Michael Legge), Kevin\u2019s partner \"Big Kevin\" (Andrew Bennett), and friend Simon (Brian Gleeson). Of course, they all have a bit of drama to explore on their journey. Kevin\u2019s father refuses to attend Fionnan's wedding if his son\u2019s partner is there. And Simon is undergoing serious financial difficulties that have plunged him into depression. While you might think there\u2019s enough movie there, Butler throws a powder keg into the campfire by introducing \"The Machine\" (Peter McDonald), Ruth\u2019s obnoxious, loud, possibly crazy brother. The Machine forces his way on the stag, despite having nothing in common with Fionnan and his mates. He threatens to destroy the whole adventure (and, for a time, the whole movie). Of course, anyone who\u2019s ever seen a film can tell you that there\u2019s more to The Machine than he lets on and that he\u2019ll help pull these gentlemen out of their shells whether they want to step out or not. There are times when Butler\u2019s sweet, character-driven comedy works, such as an argument about U2 in which The Machine literally can\u2019t believe that there\u2019s an Irishman who didn\u2019t cry at their concert, a very funny bit about how Davin feels that Fionnan only likes things after he does so first, and a musical interlude around the bonfire. \"The Bachelor Weekend\" is a screenwriting tug-of-war. Every moment that feels character-driven is off-set by one that feels forced. If McDonald isn\u2019t pushing the overbearing Machine routine (which, to be fair, isn\u2019t the actor\u2019s fault but Butler\u2019s script), the characters are going through too many predictable revelatory moments, especially in the last half-hour (the treacly piano keys kick in at almost exactly the hour mark). \"The Bachelor Weekend\" is at its best not in its scenes of men acting like children or the beats that feel more written than organic but in its most believable scenes of joyful, male friendship in between the broad humor and melodrama. I just wish there were more of them. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Leap!", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "The emotional and visual power of dance is so great that even a mediocre film can stoke our affection merely by showing it. The mediocre film in question is \u201cLeap!,\u201d the title of which will henceforth be typed without the exclamation point, because exclamation points are not only typographically irritating but emblematic of a shallow hucksterism that undercuts the entire project. This story of a plucky orphan from Brittany who tries to make it as a ballet star in Paris is set almost 150 years ago, and lacks magic, talking animals, pop culture references that will be dated\u00a0six months from now, and other tics common to so American-made cartoon features done in the Pixar-DreamWorks-BlueSky mold. It also bears the pedigree of a French entertainment conglomerate, Gaumont, and its technical credits are filled with Gallic names. So there\u2019s every reason to hope for something more than the same-old, same-old; something culturally specific and visually exciting; something with an active brain and a beating heart\u2014if not an eccentric gem like \u201cThe Triplets of Belleville\u201d or \u201cA Cat in Paris,\u201d then maybe a crowdpleaser that\u2019s as simultaneously accessible and endearing as a second-tier Pixar release like \u201cFinding Dory\u201d or \u201cThe Good Dinosaur.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement No such luck. Co-directors \u00c9ric Summer and \u00c9ric Warin and their collaborators seem determined to crush the life out of an original premise and many promising characters by stealing every available page out of a substandard American studio animated feature\u2019s playbook, from nonstop CGI-powered, 3-D animation clich\u00e9s (montages set to contemporary power-pop ballads; gratuitous \"slow motion\" to highlight big moments; \u201chelicopter shots\u201d pointlessly flying around buildings and characters) to lead characters that are written, designed and animated in such an obvious, overly emphatic way that \"Leap\" stands as a rare cartoon feature that can be legitimately criticized for bad acting.\u00a0 Wannabe-dancer Felicie (Elle Fanning), who steals another girl\u2019s identity to study at the Paris Opera Ballet; her fellow orphan Victor (Nat Wolff), an aspiring inventor; Felicie\u2019s mentor and soon-to-be-mother figure, Odette (Carlie Rae Jepsen); Odette\u2019s villainous employer R\u00e9gine Le Haut (Julie Khaner); R\u00e9gine\u2019s hateful ballerina daughter Camille (Maddie Ziegler)\u2014these and other major figures are defined entirely by their function in the film\u2019s plot: the heroine, the best friend, the villain, and so on. But in contrast to, well, good animated films aimed at family audiences, \"Leap\" seems stymied as to how to move beyond those basics. It tries to pump them up with characterization substitutes, mainly piling on physical infirmities: crossed or lazy eyes; a speech impediment and gluttonous tendencies; gap teeth and a grating laugh. There\u2019s even a one-scene cameo by a mail courier with '80s-movie, swishy-gay mannerisms. When that gambit fails, the film will latch onto bits of allegedly comic business that aren't all that funny in the first place, and become less funny the more often \"Leap\" repeats them. Victor\u2019s social and physical ineptitude, for instance, is illustrated by having him bang his head on the same church bell three times in the film\u2019s opening section, then stumble, tumble and crash through every scene in which he subsequently appears, when he\u2019s not stammering and stumbling over his words and then vocally chastising himself for messing them up. Odette fares slightly better, mainly because of Jepsen\u2019s sensitive line readings and the long face and sad, dark eyes that the animators have given her. But we deduce her tragic secret the instant we meet her, and the movie, which seems averse to giving either parents or children credit for movie-going intelligence, treats her inevitable backstory-revelation as deep and powerful, when it's actually far less compelling than the relationship she develops organically with F\u00e9licie through their shared love of dance. Mel Brooks\u2019 vocal performance as M. Luteau, the outwardly hard-nosed orphanage supervisor with a secretly soft heart, invests him with a bit of life beyond his\u00a0exopthalmia\u00a0and hunched-over posture; but like so many minor characters in \u201cLeap,\u201d he\u2019s undercut by throwaway dialogue that sounds as if it was dropped into the soundtrack during post-production to explain things that don't need explaining. (When Luteau helps the heroine in the last act\u2014a moment anyone who\u2019s seen a movie before, any movie, will eagerly anticipate\u2014F\u00e9licie exclaims \u201cI knew you weren\u2019t as bad as people say!\u201d) Advertisement F\u00e9licie\u2019s story becomes compelling anyway because it couples an expression of pure willpower with that foolproof sports-and-arts movie standby, the training montage in which new skills are practiced and mastered. The best thing about \u201cLeap\u201d is its portrayal of the dance world, then and now, as both exhilarating and cruel: practically an altar that fanatical young people sacrifice their bodies upon. Anybody who\u2019s danced or been close to a dancer will testify to the emotional truth of the sequences where Odette puts F\u00e9licie through her paces, as well as to the knife-twisting comments that the Paris Opera Ballet\u2019s choreographer M\u00e9rante (Terrence Scammell) makes as he cuts girls from a lineup of potential \u201cSwan Lake\" leads. But \u201cLeap\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to grasp how special these elements are. Rather than do its brave, tough, purehearted heroine the courtesy of concentrating on her artistic and emotional evolution and the indignities and injuries she suffers for her art, it keeps wasting her time (and ours) with theoretically comic or suspenseful subplots that we\u2019ve seen done many times before, with considerably more wit and feeling. The love triangle between the bumbling best friend-nice guy (Victor) and the tall, blond, full-of-himself rival (Tamer Kapelian\u2019s Rudolph), who claims to be a Russian prince, soon becomes tedious because neither young man seems charismatic enough to steal the spotlight away from F\u00e9licie\u2019s true, great love, dance. More exasperating is the sneering, shallow hatefulness of the rival\u2019s mother, R\u00e9gine. She's been given Cinderella\u2019s stepmother\u2019s hell-pit eyes and fitted with a jet-black version of her tumorous hairdo, as if her constant physical humiliation of F\u00e9licie and Odette, literally her chambermaids, didn\u2019t cement that connection for us straightaway. The film\u2019s misallocation of dramatic resources reaches a bizarre zenith in the finale, which delays the heroine\u2019s understudy-who-gets-a-big-break debut (another ancient clich\u00e9 that we spot from a thousand yards off, and can\u2019t wait to see and revel in) for a long action sequence set beneath and near just-finished Eiffel Tower and the unfinished Statue of Liberty. It seems mainly interested in proving that Victor was the right guy for F\u00e9licie all along. Given how invested we\u2019ve become in her quest at that point, despite all the prefabricated storytelling hurdles placed between her and her debut, Victor's vindication is the last thing on our minds. F\u00e9licie deserves better. So does dance.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Puerto Ricans in Paris", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The job of the character actor is multifold. He must be reliable and versatile, and he must add texture and reality to a film just by showing up. The movie stars couldn't shine as brightly without the character actors around them. For decades now, Luis Guzm\u00e1n has been one of the best character actors in the business. Films are made better merely because he is in them (and you can't say that about many A-List headliners). Like all good character actors, his talent is not limited or narrow. He can be serious or funny. He can play smart or dumb. He's a tremendous listener: his reaction shots often help entire scenes land. Think of what \"Punch Drunk Love\" (just one example) would have been without him in it. Impossible. So a huge part of the pleasure of a film like director Ian Edelman's \"Puerto Ricans in Paris\" is that Guzm\u00e1n is one of the leads, which means he appears in every\u00a0scene, as opposed to just a few. He can convey more in a sideways glance than most actors can convey with their whole bodies. Advertisement \"Puerto Ricans in Paris\" (co-written by Edelman and Neel Shah) has a classic culture-clash set-up. Eddie (Eddie Garcia) and Luis (Guzm\u00e1n) are brothers-in-law who also have successful NYPD detective careers busting up counterfeit fashion rings running out of storefronts on Canal Street. Their work has gotten the attention of French bag designer Colette (Alice Taglioni), who flies to New York, in all her short-skirted, huge-sunglasses French gorgeousness, to ask them personally to help her track down a stolen prototype of one of her bags. The two guys leap at the chance, not just because of the reward money offered to them, but also as an escape from their two very different sets of woman problems: Eddie and Gloria (Rosie Perez, another essential character actor) have been together since they were teenagers, have a bunch of kids, and their relationship is a mixture of boredom and irritation; Luis has been dating Vanessa (Rosario Dawson, very funny in her small role) for a while, but refuses to pop the question. She's furious. Paris represents not only an escape from all of this but a lucrative validation of their competence as detectives. Surprisingly, and refreshingly, the \"culture clash\" aspect of \"Puerto Ricans in Paris\" is not the driving engine of the plot or the source of the film's energy and humor. Yes, it's funny when Guzm\u00e1n, in his loud Hawaiian shirt, swaggers up to a snooty French woman on the sidewalk and asks to bum a cigarette, calling her \"mami\" in the process. There are many such scenes, and they're all funny, but Edelman doesn't milk the situation for all it's worth, as might be expected. Instead, he focuses on the case the guys have been hired to solve and the Byzantine Venn-diagram of suspects, but mostly on their\u00a0dynamics\u00a0as a duo and their interactions with other characters. Garcia and Guzm\u00e1n, who both had roles on Edelman's HBO series \"How to Make It in America\" have the easy chemistry of guys who have known each other forever.\u00a0 Eddie and Luis find themselves immersed in Colette's world as she drags them around to parties and nightclubs. She and Eddie form a surprising and sudden bond that has more to do with the struggles of being a parent than anything sexual or romantic. It appears to be a real friendship and Luis looks on with suspicion. Luis strikes out with every French girl he approaches, and cannot understand why Colette seems to prefer Eddie over him. There's a very funny sequence where Eddie is a huge hit at a dinner party, and poor Luis can't get a full sentence out before someone interrupts him. Meanwhile, during the day, Eddie and Luis go undercover as Saudi sheikhs, or international drug dealers, to investigate the different suspects. It is completely ridiculous and completely entertaining.\u00a0 Advertisement While there are obligatory shots of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, Edelman does not shoot Paris as a travel brochure. The guys are out and about in the streets, riding bikes, walking to the local cafe, hanging out on balconies at after-hours parties. Paris provides a backdrop just as New York does. Sure, the guys think Paris is beautiful. Eddie falls in love with the taste of macarons. Luis plans to steal all of the fancy soaps in the shower. But the story is deeper than the title may suggest, and funnier. There's even a fashion montage, when Colette's flamboyantly gay assistant comes over with outfits for them to wear to a dinner party. If you've always wanted to see Guzm\u00e1n do a fashion montage, \"Puerto Ricans in Paris\" provides.\u00a0 \"Puerto Ricans in Paris,\" stolen bag aside, is really about two guys who know each other really well, who have woman-problems, and who figure out some important stuff about their lives while racing around Paris dressed up as sheikhs. It's charming. It's funny. The case they investigate has a legitimate twist to it, there's a lot of French intrigue, there's much that is totally implausible, but the film lives or dies on the dynamic of the two main guys. It lives.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Turbo", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Turbo\" is just strange and lively enough to make you wish it were better. This DreamWorks animated picture has an appealingly bizarre premise\u2014a racecar-crazy snail (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) dreams of competing in the Indianapolis 500\u2014and its sense of humor is so odd that at times you wonder if the movie is savaging the very cliches that it would not exist without. If only. There's a \"Rudy\"-like hero Theo, aka. Turbo, who studies old VHS cassettes of Indy 500 races and tries to get his time up to maybe one meter per day. There's Theo's brother Chet (Paul Giamatti), who works at \"the plant\" (a tomato garden) alongside Turbo and cautions him to put aside his unrealistic dreams. He ends up helping him achieve them after Turbo gets pulled into a street racecar's engines and granted magical powers through a process I don't understand, and am probably not meant to. There's also a team of misfit (and multiracial, if only by voice and body language) pals who spark Turbo's enthusiasm and rally to his defense: the volatile Whiplash (Samuel L. Jackson), the flirtatious and saucy Burn (Maya Rudolph), the jocular Smoove Move (Snoop Dogg), and White Shadow (Steve Bell), a big mollusk who has but one catch phrase and uses it even when it doesn't make any sense.\u00a0There's an enthusiastic human dreamer, too\u2014a beefy kid named Tito (Michael Pe\u00f1a)who adopts our snail hero and makes his freak-of-nature speed the centerpiece of a PR plan. Tito operates Dos Bros Taco Stand with his older brother Angelo (Luis Guzman). Their relationship mirrors Turbo and Chet's in ways both large and small. Advertisement There are a lot of touches like these\u2014touches that suggest that director David Soren, his cowriters Robert Siegel and Darren Lemke, and his animators, artists and sound designers have tried to trick-out a factory-issued vehicle with custom decals, gladiator rims and neon lights. The film's dialogue is smarter than it needed to be to pass muster with families who aren't looking for art so much as decent focus and comfortable seats. I like how Turbo tends to \"lawyer\" the other characters' insults and proclamations, pouncing on grammatical errors and contradictions, tweaking them so subtly that they aren't always sure if they've been tweaked. (\"Your trash talk is needlessly complicated,\" Whiplash warns him.) Some of the running gags verge on satire, such as the acidic portrayal of Turbo's hero, the preening, callous racing champ Guy Gagne (Bill Hader), and a crazy action sequence near the midway point in which the snails seem to be surfing on power lines while House of Pain's \"Jump Around\" blasts on the soundtrack. The film is never more aware of its own absurdity than when Turbo successfully enters the Indy 500 and his talking snail brother shrieks, \"Has the whole world lost its mind?\" The voice casting and some of the humor leave \"Turbo\" open to charges of insensitivity. These buddy snails are coded \"ethnic\", and contrasted with Turbo and Chet's more stereotypical whitebread attitudes. (Whiplash even mocks the newcomers for being backyard snails, more pampered and meek than street snails.) \"Turbo\" is the second blockbuster this summer (the other is \"The Lone Ranger\") to evoke \"Dumbo.\" With his freakish powers, Turbo is the mollusk version of Disney's big-eared elephant; his brother Chet is as unsupportive of Turbo as Timothy the Mouse was supportive of Dumbo, but he sure does sound like him, thanks to Giamatti's lovable whine; Whiplash and company are the crows, shucking and jiving in service of the hero's inspiration. This would be pretty offensive if the film didn't have such a comfortably urban sensibility. It's a \"White people dance like this, black people dance like that\" sort of attitude, presupposing that backyard snails need to loosen up and expand their horizons. To that end, the film evokes \"The Fast and the Furious\" series, \"Pulp Fiction\" and other multicultural touchstones with great affection, and stocks the soundtrack with imaginatively chosen hip-hop and rhythm and blues cues (including the Jackson 5's \"Going Back to Indiana\"). It even alludes to one of Jackson's most famous lines in a Quentin Tarantino picture\u2014minus the profanity, of course. Advertisement That \"Turbo\" is pushing old coded buttons for a reason would be cause for celebration if the result weren't a slightly hipper gloss on the kid-flick usual. Gagne's catchphrase \"No dream too big, no dreamer too small\" sounds wonderful on paper, and you'd have no reason to expect a family-friendly blockbuster to subvert it if you hadn't already seen Pixar's unexpectedly clever and altogether superior \"Monsters University\" do exactly that. There's nothing new here, just old stuff in a new-ish package. This movie's enjoyable, but never as daring or bizarre as it could have been. It hits all the beats you expect it to hit, exactly when you expect it to hit them, while pretending to mock films that are all about the beats.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Big Stone Gap", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cWhen I was a girl and we drove past the coal mines it seemed like a storybook to me,\u201d the lead character of \u201cBig Stone Gap,\u201d rather amusingly named Ave Maria Mulligan, says at the beginning of this movie, written and directed by Adriana Trigiani and based on her popular novel of the same name. The movie\u2019s title is also the name of the small town in Virginia it depicts and was apparently shot in. \u201cLife was simple\u201d there, Ave Maria tells us, and we can believe it.\u00a0 \n Ave Maria, played by Ashley Judd, relates to the viewer that in 1978, the year she turned 40, she was the official town spinster of Big Stone Gap. Although for the first twenty minutes or so, one gets the impression she doesn\u2019t seem to mind much. She\u2019s the director of the town\u2019s annual theatrical production of \u201cThe Trail Of The Lonesome Pine\u201d and rehearsals are going well and the show is close to selling out. She is capable of flirting productively with the town\u2019s best looking eligible bachelor Jack (Patrick Wilson) and has solid friendships with other fellows in the town, including theater cohort Theodore (John Benjamin Hickey). She has nifty female pals played by Whoopi Goldberg and Jenna Elfman. She\u2019s friend to the local outcast young woman Pearl. She lives in a big old house with her wonderful, Italian-accented mom.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Who, alas, dies in the aforementioned first twenty minutes. \u201cNo one worries about you like your mother,\u201d Ave Maria says in voiceover. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn to her anymore and it changes your life forever.\u201d Ain\u2019t it the truth. Also changing Ave Maria\u2019s life: the revelation of a family secret, the threats of a nasty quasi-in-law, and the prospect of Jack\u2019s marriage to a local hotsy-totsy who\u2019s such a hotsy-totsy that she actually goes by the name \u201cSweet Sue\u201d (Jane Krakowski). And turning the whole town\u2019s head is the prospect of a visit from a senatorial candidate named John Warner and his movie star wife Elizabeth Taylor. (And yes, this event is a historical fact, and a somewhat notorious one, as the movie shows, or as you can find out via a computer search engine).\u00a0 \n The movie ambles along amiably enough for a while; it\u2019s better if you are a fan of one or more members of the cast. Judd brings her \u201cWhere The Heart Is\u201d/\u201dA Time To Kill\u201d A-game to the proceedings, Goldberg doesn\u2019t overdo her friendly comedy relief, Elfman is bubbly, Krakowski dry, Wilson handsome. Jasmine Guy turns up, looking rather remarkably like Ruby Dee. The movie puts its foot in a big pile of goofy when the character of \u201cElizabeth Taylor\u201d makes herself known as a bouffy wig on actress Dagmara Dominczyk, always shot from behind. This coincides with a ramping up of the movie\u2019s romantic comedy content, and if you are not on board by this time, you might find yourself nodding in vigorous, non-ironic agreement with Goldberg\u2019s character at the point when she observes, \u201cThis is the dumbest wedding I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Crown Heights", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Crown Heights\" is a pretty good movie about a great subject: the sheer backbreaking labor necessary to force the system to even acknowledge a terrible injustice, much less make it right. Written and directed by Matt Ruskin, the film retells the story of Colin Warner (\u201cShort Term 12\u201d star Lakeith Stanfield), a Brooklyn man from a Trinidadian family whose life as a burglar and car thief was interrupted by a 20-year stint in prison for a crime that nobody, including the officers who arrested him, thinks he committed. Advertisement The story begins on April 10, 1980, when Colin Warner is arrested in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. He thinks he's been busted for stealing a car. The cops inform him that he's being charged with shooting and killing a local Jamaican teenager named Mark Hamilton in the nearby neighborhood of Flatbush. Colin tells him he's innocent. It's not that they don't believe him; they just don't care. Somebody has to go to jail for the crime, and it's going to be Colin. He's on the hook because he has a criminal record and a witness was coerced into picking his photo out of a book of mugshots. The witness, a frightened young teenager (Skylan Brooks), recants his testimony on the stand, but it doesn't matter. Turner is sentenced to 15 years to life, with a possibility of early release if he expresses remorse for a crime he did not commit.  Up until this point, Ruskin's film is compelling but unremarkable. Its wobbly blue-grey images are shot close and cut fast, the default visual language of TV programs about urban cops and robbers. The storytelling is similarly rushed, sprinting through moments that might've been profoundly wrenching if the movie had enough faith to stay inside a moment. (Give the director credit, though, for having the old-movie gumption to jump ahead several years in a single cut and trust Stanfield's performance to fill in the emotional connective tissue.)  The visual storytelling never develops much personality, but the screenplay's decision to shift focus from Warner to his best friend Carl (former Oakland Raider Nnamdi Asomugha) energizes and focuses the story. As Carl goes from house to apartment to government office, re-investigating the case, debating and chastising lawyers, and ultimately crowdfunding neighborhood money to hire William Robedee (Bill Camp), an attorney who seems as outraged by Colin's plight as Carl is, \"Crown Heights\" sketches the entwined obstacles standing between the hero and his freedom: racism and institutional exhaustion.  Advertisement This is a world in which poor people's lives, more so black and brown lives, don't matter to the state. Colin and the man who actually committed the murder are considered interchangeable as long as the case can be marked \"solved\" and the overworked, cynical employees of the police department, the prison system and the courts can get a green light to move along to the next outrage, which will likely also be dispatched in a cursory way. There's a long section in the middle of \"Crown Heights\" where Colin and Carl's stories play off each other in a grandly melodramatic and satisfying way, echoing sections of HBO's recent potboiler \"The Night Of,\" which had a similar color palette. The film alternates between Colin trapped behind bars, turning into the kind of dead-end hard-case that the arresting officers already insisted he was back in 1980, and Carl, William Robedee and other allies working to exonerate him, uncovering ever-more-appalling proof of the brokenness of the system. The problem is, despite the best efforts of Ruskin's writing and direction and Stanfield's expressive performance (it's all in the eyes), Colin's story remains the tale of a martyr to the system, struggling to hold onto shreds of his dignity as he's stripped, de-loused, caged with an actual murderer, packed into a cell block with gangbangers and assorted creeps, and repeatedly urged to express remorse for the murder, something he refuses to do because he's innocent. This is a powerful story but also a familiar and essentially passive one. Despite moving scenes of Colin falling in love behind bars with his sweetheart from the outside (Natalie Paul) and belatedly studying the law in an attempt to save himself, the sequences that show Carl battling injustice on the outside are more dynamic and fresh. They also make every point that Colin's story makes, but in an active way, with a chess aspect: is a legal checkmate possible here, and if so, what moves will get them there?  Ruskin's commitment to giving both men's stories equal screen time is honorable, but it tends to staunch the momentum of a given storyline whenever it's threatening to build to a head. The film's climax is powerful nonetheless, and the performances carry the day. Stanfield is a true movie star, radiating decency even as the character's shell hardens, and Asomugha, who is credited as a producer, holds his own against some formidable character actors, including Camp, who's turning into one of the MVP's of cinema and television. The film's signature image is of the hero's eyes, which take in sights that no one should see. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Seventh Son", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cHope for the best, expect the worst.\u201d Mel Brooks\r\npopularized that adage in a funny song he co-wrote for one of his most amusing\r\nfilms, the relatively obscure 1970 \u201cThe Twelve Chairs.\u201d It\u2019s a useful sentiment\r\nin general, but, for the film reviewer, something that applies most particularly\r\nin the first two months of the new year, which, at least as far as studio\r\nproduct is concerned, represent a dumping ground for problematic product or\r\njust plain unmarketable dreck.  Given the fact that its U.S. release date was moved not\r\nonce, but twice, and that it now finds itself occupying a date in the\r\naforementioned dumping ground, one might expect the Sergei-Bodrov-directed\r\n\u201cSeventh Son,\u201d a medieval fantasy tale with a strong Young Adult stress in its\r\nplotting (not surprising, as it\u2019s based on a YA book, the first of three so far\r\nfeaturing the same characters, as is the thing these days) to be pretty bad.\r\nBut, surprise! One doesn\u2019t want to damn the movie with faint praise by saying\r\n\u201cit\u2019s not that bad,\u201d but that\u2019s kind of the most objectively accurate\r\ndescription of it, in all honesty. Subjectively, though? This critic, who\u2019s an\r\nunabashed fan of the myth-mash-up monster movies of the \u201850s and \u201860s that\r\nfeatured a plethora of stop-motion-animated monsters and such, found himself\r\nrather enjoying more than a few portions of the movie, which indeed features a\r\nplethora of computer-animated monsters that at least seem to have been inspired\r\nby the work of such old-school tech masters as Ray Harryhausen.  Advertisement Another attraction is that the adult leads of the picture\r\nare Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore. Bridges plays a righteous witch-hunting\r\n\u201cspook\u201d (he\u2019s also a Knight of some secret sacred order or another) while\r\nMoore plays a near-omnipotent witch who\u2019s going to use the\r\nonce-in-a-hundred-years \u201cnight of the blood moon\u201d to make herself 100%\r\nomnipotent. Of course these two characters have a romantic back-story. Of\r\ncourse they do. Since every other film critic writing about this movie is going\r\nto make some kind of \u201cI didn\u2019t think the sequel to \u2018Big Lebowski\u2019 would be THIS\r\nweird\u201d joke, I\u2019ll spare you my effort. It is, however, a pleasure to see The\r\nDude and Maude in a clinch once more, even if Bridges\u2019 mumble-mouthed, grizzled\r\nhero is more like his \u201cTrue Grit\u201d Rooster Coburn crossed with Richard Harris in\r\n\u201cCamelot,\u201d had Richard Harris been 70 in \u201cCamelot.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s a truly\r\neccentric performance, and why not. As for Moore, she looks gorgeous and\r\nslithers with enough menace that you can almost convince yourself that her\r\ndragon-morph isn't a special effect.  The YA aspect is provided by the spook\u2019s new apprentice, the\r\ntitular seventh son Tom Ward (Ben Barnes), who, of course, falls for a teen witch\r\n(half-witch, more accurately; the condition of half-witchdom plays a crucial\r\nalbeit entirely predictable part in the plot) who\u2019s the daughter of Moore\u2019s\r\nright-hand witch. The standard complications ensue, but they\u2019re pretty easy to\r\ngloss over if you just wanna get off on the fellas battling man-bears and\r\nmulti-armed swordsman and a bald-pated guy who can make ax-blades out of his\r\nhands when he\u2019s NOT being a dragon. At such points, and particularly during a\r\ncliff-diving-and-waterfall scene in which Tom goes up against a very stubborn\r\ngiant, \u201cSeventh Son\u201d builds up the goofy charm of an old-school Saturday\r\nafternoon matinee. The tech credits, as they call them in the trades, tell you\r\nwhy: the effects were designed by original \u201cStar Wars\u201d guy John Dykstra, and\r\nthe sumptuous art direction is by Dante Ferretti, who\u2019s worked magic for the\r\nlikes of Fellini, De Palma, and Scorsese. Olivia Williams and Djimon Hounsou\r\nare welcome components in the supporting cast, and the whole thing is over and\r\ndone with in a good deal less than two hours.

{"Title": "Gook", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Not too long into this period film, set during one fateful day in Paramount, California, the title\u2019s racial epithet is spray-painted on the car belonging to Eli, who runs a crumbling-looking shoe store on a pretty desolate corner of the town with his brother Daniel. The slim, wiry Eli, played by the movie\u2019s writer/director Justin Chon, and the stocky, slightly lumbering Daniel, played by David So, are Korean-Americans in a struggling neighborhood that\u2019s largely populated by African Americans. Mr. Kim, another, less assimilated (and older) Korean who runs the liquor store across the street, is suspicious if not downright hostile of his clientele. But Eli and Daniel are into hip-hop culture, and the 11-year-old girl who helps out at their store, and with whom they have a more positive relationship than with each other, is black.  Advertisement The aforementioned fateful day is April 29, 1992, the day many \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdicts were handed down in the Rodney King case and South Central L.A., along with outlying areas, erupted in rioting and looting. The graffiti is painted on Eli\u2019s car before the announcements. That\u2019s just how it is for the brothers; the possibility for outright hostility exists in every interaction, as for instance when Daniel tries to explain to an irate customer that the sales discount on a particular pair of shoes doesn\u2019t exempt them from taxes. Their young friend Kamilla is lively and affectionate, with a not-too-wide streak of mischief. She annoys Mr. Kim greatly, and cuts school to be with the brothers. She\u2019s got a furious thuggish brother Keith (Curtiss Cook, Jr.) and a kind sister, but no parents to speak of. Daniel and Eli, too, seem to be permanently without their dad, who founded the shop. The connecting back story emerges over the course of the movie. Shot in widescreen black and white, the movie is at its best when depicting the friendship between the kid and the older kids. Explaining her presence in the store to customers, Daniel says, \u201cShe\u2019s adopted.\u201d Eli says, \u201cShe\u2019s half Korean, half black.\u201d And Kamilla tops it off with \u201cI\u2019m being held here against my will.\u201d  But the moments of charm and fun are few. \u201cGook\u201d makes some halting attempts to get down to causes in examining the affinities and antagonisms in communities where both Asian Americans and African Americans are trying to get ahead. Daniel has ambitions to become an R&B singer, and his interactions with a local aspiring record producer have some spark, but the movie\u2019s pivotal event puts an end to that. In the interest of generating or furthering tension, writer/director Chon sets up situations that make the characters look maybe a little dumber than they ought to. When one customer tries to pay for shoes with a 50-dollar bill, Eli can\u2019t make change. So he dispatches Kamilla to go to Mr. Kim\u2019s to ask him to break the bill. It\u2019s been made abundantly clear in a prior scene that Mr. Kim despises Kamilla and will at the very least smell some kind of rat when she approaches him with a 50. And of course he does, and it gets a little worse.  Advertisement The constant fighting between Dan and Eli is also as monochromatic as the movie\u2019s look. \u201cEvery f**king day you give me s**t about the same f**king thing!\u201d Daniel screams at Eli as he locks himself in the car. \u201cOpen the f**king door,\u201d Eli yells back. If this is verisimilitude, it\u2019s kind of self-defeating. Everyone is so keyed up that the drama takes on a kind of zero sum game quality. The constant stream of eruptions, temperamental and otherwise, leads to a genuinely upsetting climax.

It is in millions of homes, having been read to millions of\r\nchildren. There have been radio plays, television adaptations and film\r\nversions. So why tell this story again? Could Mark Osborne, the director of \u201cKung\r\nFu Panda,\u201d really have something new to say regarding this timeless tale? And\r\nhow do you adapt a relatively thin novella into a feature film that will keep\r\nkids entertained and adults entranced? \u201cThe Little Prince,\u201d premiering on\r\nNetflix this Friday after Paramount inexplicably dumped it earlier this year\r\n(and after it has made almost $100 million worldwide) takes the themes of its\r\nsource material and expands on them to create a lovely, big-hearted tale of\r\nadventure, friendship and imagination. Without a single pop song to be heard or\r\na bodily humor joke to be endured, \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d doesn\u2019t talk down to its\r\naudience, treating them with the respect that so few American family films\r\nbother to do. It is a cinematic crime that the abrasive garbage that is \u201cThe\r\nAngry Birds Movie\u201d and \u201cIce Age: Collision Course\u201d get national releases while\r\nmost people don\u2019t even know \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d is coming to win their hearts\r\nthis weekend. Advertisement Osborne and his team shift focus to a new protagonist, \u201cThe Little\r\nGirl\u201d (beautifully, richly voiced by Mackenzie Foy), a smart heroine who is\r\nessentially being trained by her mother (Rachel McAdams) for the big, dangerous\r\nworld of being an adult. She\u2019s trying to get into the prestigious Werth Academy\r\nand her mother has her entire summer vacation planned out on a big board. Let\u2019s\r\njust say, in this community in which all the homes look identical and every\r\nneighborhood is designed like a grid, this poor girl is going to be doing a lot\r\nof studying and not a lot of playing. Until she meets her neighbor. While her single mother is at work, The Little Girl strikes\r\nup a friendship with the old man who lives next door. In a house that contains\r\nall the curves and quirks missing from the rest of the neighborhood, \u201cThe\r\nAviator\u201d (Jeff Bridges) tells his new friends stories, including the time he\r\nmet \u201cThe Little Prince.\u201d The details of The Aviator\u2019s stories aren\u2019t nearly as\r\nimportant as the themes they convey. As The Aviator relays stories of \u201cThe Rose\u201d\r\n(Marion Cotillard), \u201cThe Fox\u201d (James Franco), \u201cThe Snake\u201d (Benicio Del Toro),\r\nand others, we watch The Little Girl come out of her shell. She\u2019s fascinated by\r\nThe Aviator\u2019s drawings (which will be familiar to fans of the book) and learns\r\nthe lessons that they just don\u2019t teach you at school, even the Werth Academy. As\r\nit should be, \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d is heavy with philosophical observations like\r\n\u201cGrowing up is not the problem, forgetting is\u201d and \u201cIt is only with the heart\r\nthat one can see rightly.\u201d It\u2019s notable that Osborne and company aren't afraid\r\nof deeper themes. It could have been tempting to turn \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d\r\ninto a wacky adventure movie (I guarantee there have been scripts of that\r\nnature on Hollywood desks), but Osborne\u2019s take is deeply emotional and\r\nheartfelt. It gets a little repetitive in the mid-section, but the final act,\r\nwhich I won\u2019t spoil, essentially brings The Aviator\u2019s stories and lessons to\r\nlife, making the journey worthwhile.\u00a0 It helps one overlook the narrative and philosophical repetition that the film\r\nis accomplished on a technical level as well. Most notably, the score,\r\nco-composed by Hans Zimmer, is a lyrical, lovely piece of work. It carries the\r\nviewer along, fluidly tying together the worlds of \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d (both\r\nthe girl\u2019s and the story of the prince). Visually, the first act of the film, with its\r\nsquare trees to match its square houses, reminded me of the suburban rigidity\r\nof the first act of Brad Bird\u2019s \u201cThe Incredibles,\u201d \u00a0while visions of the world of the title character\r\nreminded me of LAIKA gems like \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cParanorman.\u201d These are good\r\ncomparisons to make when one watches a family film. It\u2019s in good company. Advertisement Ultimately, \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d is a film that everyone should be happy to show their children. They might get a little bored, but if\r\nthey even take away a positive theme or two, it\u2019s worthwhile. And, in the end,\r\nadults might remember an important truth about the world as well. Becoming an\r\nadult doesn\u2019t mean giving up on dreams, whimsy, imagination or love. It\u2019s a\r\nlesson that children\u2019s fiction has been teaching us since long before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\r\npublished his hit novella.

And post-production is pretty\r\nmuch the last part of the filmmaking process in which to introduce that kind of\r\nshift.  Not to get too inside-baseball, but sometimes there\u2019s a very\r\ngood reason that certain movies get stealthy on-demand releases during what\r\nindustry members frequently refer to as \u201cdumping season.\u201d This very unfortunate\r\nfilm, directed by Roland Joff\u00e9 from his own script (the story is from Indian\r\nscreenwriter Ajey Jhankar), opens with some deep-sea diving action that recalls\r\nJames Cameron\u2019s \u201cTitanic\u201d; as does the quest of the divers in question: they\r\nare pursuing a particular artifact. In any\r\nevent, one of the divers is stuck, and so team commander Josh Hartnett goes\r\ndown to rescue her (she\u2019s his wife...oh, wait, now all of a sudden it\u2019s \u201cThe\r\nAbyss\u201d) and in so doing almost drowns. Once Hartnett\u2019s character from our-not-too-distant-future\r\n(lots of blue lighting and a sleek futuristic vehicle are the most prominent\r\nvisual signifiers of this time frame) flounders on life support, the movie goes\r\nback in time several hundred years, to India in the late 1700s, where a British\r\ncaptain named James Stewart (really!) also played by Hartnett, is engaged in a\r\nlot of challenging-to-follow martial intrigue that leads him into a doomed\r\nromance with a regal warrior woman played by Bipasha Basu, one of the premiere\r\nleading ladies of Bollywood.  Advertisement The scenic cinematography by Ben Nott is often beautiful,\r\nwhich distracts, at times, from the fact that the storyline is both convoluted\r\nin the most gratuitous way possible and that it\u2019s enacted in the most\r\nunengaging way imaginable. Every now and then one will be shaken awake by some\r\nof the most stultifying clich\u00e9d dialogue concocted in all of narrative movie\r\nhistory, to wit:  \u201cTell me of this Captain Stewart.\u201d \u201cHe is a leader of men.\u201d \u201cHe inspires love in our people?\u201d \u201cSome people say so, father. \u201c \u201cThen it will benefit us to arrange his death.\u201d During an earlier exchange at a large table, some pompous\r\nbad guys conspire and contemplate getting over on the ostensibly good people\r\nthey require cooperation from: \u201cThe vast sum of money involved will mollify\r\ntheir scruples,\u201d says one, and there\u2019s haw-hawing all around. Little bits such\r\nas these are the only things the movie offers to rouse a viewer from a stupor;\r\nthen again, some of the sounds of stabbing during the movie\u2019s occasional\r\nbreakouts of martial violence are very ripe and wet and loud, which is also\r\nnoteworthy; in every other respect, watching \u201cThe Lovers\u201d is only a noteworthy\r\nexperience for the way the movie just evanesces as it goes on. For all the\r\nexpense of the production, it offers practically nothing in the way of either\r\nemotional or intellectual engagement, and once the viewer is finished with\r\ntrying to care about the plot, the only remaining question is why the film was\r\nmade.\u00a0 My conclusion was that it had something to do with expected box office\r\nreturns in an international market, what with Basu toplining the cast;\r\nunfortunately for her, she looks pretty haggard throughout and is given little\r\nopportunity to extend the charisma that made her a star on her continent.\r\nSimilarly, Hartnett seems only to strike poses and draw blanks. I have not\r\nexpected much of anything from Joff\u00e9 as a director since\u2026well, ever, really, as\r\nhis only entirely watchable film, 1984\u2019s \u201cThe Killing Fields,\u201d had such a\r\nstrong story and cast that Joff\u00e9\u2019s refined-yet-lead-footed directorial approach\r\ncouldn\u2019t kill it. If you think you have fond memories of \u201cThe Mission,\u201d I\r\nrespectfully suggest it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t looked at it again in a while: I\r\nhave, and it\u2019s a drag. As has been everything after that. \u201cThe Lovers\u201d is both\r\nworse and perhaps better than a drag: it\u2019s a tranquilizer.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Mistress America", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Noah Baumbach has been making movies for twenty years now, and they've nearly always been comedies of the sort that I call \"radio with pictures\"\u2014not because of any inherent lack of filmmaking skill (he's quite a good director) but because his characters are often so deluded or bitter or ignorant or self-aggrandizing or otherwise unpleasant that I find myself watching certain scenes through the cracks between my fingers. \"Kicking and Screaming,\" \"Mr. Jealousy,\" \"The Squid and the Whale,\" \"Margot at the Wedding\" and \"Greenberg\" were all picture-radio incarnate: astute at detailing the sorts of people you try to avoid at parties (or who try to avoid you, maybe?) and at times unnervingly willing to stick the knife into characters, and you, and twist it.  Advertisement Baumbach's collaborations since hooking up with onetime costar and now collaborator Greta Gerwig\u2014whom he first worked with on \"Greenberg\"\u2014have changed his tone. His movies are now slightly less scathing and a bit more accessible, but without for one moment sending the message that he's suddenly become nice and sweet. They feel even more like mid-period Woody Allen films than they already did, although Baumbach, like a lot of dialogue-driven American filmmakers, owes so much to Allen that this might have been inevitable no matter who he worked with. His latest, \"Mistress America,\" gives Gerwig the sort of role that Diane Keaton would have knocked out of the park for Allen: Brooke, an almost-thirtysomething New Yorker who talks and talks without every actually seeming to listen, much less connect, with anyone else, and who wants to be influential and famous and successful but doesn't seem to have any sort of realistic plan for achieving that, or any particular talents to bring to bear on her goal. Brooke isn't the main character of the film, though: that would be Tracy Fishcoe (Lola Kirke), a Columbia University student whose mother, Stevie (Kathryn Erbe), is about to marry Brooke's widowed dad. Tracy is an incoming freshman who doesn't know anyone in New York; she's never met Brooke, but her mom hopes Brooke will bond with her and become a companion or even mentor to her, and urges her daughter to make it happen.  Baumbach can be a marvelous, unsparing reporter on a certain slice of upper-middle-class to wealthy America. He brings that skill to bear here in the scenes of Tracy feeling out of her element. The satirical details of college student delusions of grandeur are expertly observed by Baumbach and his co-writer Gerwig, particularly the competition to get into a literary society that taps its new members by hitting them in the face with pies, then hands them briefcases to carry as emblems of their specialness. Brooke, her too-competitive classmate Tony (Matthew Shear), and Tony\u2019s dour girlfriend Nicolette (Jasmine Cephas Jones) are all sharply observed. Like many Baumbach characters, they're entitled and oblivious. They fantasize about skipping to the head of the cultural line, maybe collecting that Nobel for literature before they hit the big three-o. At the same time, the movie has trace elements of sympathy for the lonely and alienated: the scene where Tracy eats alone in a booth at a restaurant from a takeout container while listening to Paul McCartney's \"No More Lonely Nights\" on the PA system and pondering her cracked cell phone screen captures minor-key depression perfectly. Once Brooke whirls into the story, things take a turn for the madcap. She comes on like a classic Diane Keaton beautiful kook\u2014imagine Annie Hall by way of the character in \"Love and Death\" who insists that subjectivity is objective\u2014but there's a specificity to her that's uniquely maddening. She and Tracy match up in the a way that they probably both think is marvelous but that soon shows its downside. They aren't really talking to each other, but having adjacent monologues, with each waiting for a turn to chime in and talk about themselves. Gerwig and Baumbach's dialogue here nails this social class' self-aggrandizement with surgical precision. Brooke describes herself as an \"autodidact\" and adds, \"that word is one of the words I self-taught myself!\" She works casual mentions of her dead mother into unrelated conversations (\"That's cool about the frozen yogurt machine...everyone I love dies\"). She knocks her skull with her knuckles for good luck and brags about her newfound appreciation for \"the social media,\" which she hopes to parlay into making her dreams, whatever they are, come true.  Advertisement Brooke is the kind of person that you think of as a \"young spirit\" if you yourself are young and don't know any better. She calls herself a \"curator,\" a word that people use to describe themselves when they have no talent or skill. She talks about turning a cramped and awkward space into a combination restaurant, coffee shop and cultural crossroads called \"Mom's\" (of course). She's going to fund this venture by tracking down an ex-boyfriend named Dylan (Michael Chernus of \"Orange is the New Black\") and the wife, Mimi Clare (Heather Lind), that Brooke claims stole Dylan away from her, along with an idea that later proved lucrative. Brooke says this whole gambit is about redressing grievance, but if you've watched her for more than five minutes you know she's unreliable, and that unflattering details will come out soon enough. Baumbach has said that he had movies like \"Something Wild\" in mind while writing the script with Gerwig, and the film does have a touch of that formula, with Brooke as a variation of the \"life force\" character leading a more straitlaced narrator, Tracy, plus the increasingly unhappy Tony and Nicolette, on a whirlwind misadventure. There's a parallel story about Tracy developing the ruthlessness necessary to translate life into meaningful art. Of all the Columbia kids we meet, only she seems to have the stuff to become a credible writer of realistic fiction. Some of the snippets we hear in voice-over of \"Mistress America,\" a short-story-in-progress about Brooke, do suggest talent, plus an acuity that would make Brooke uncomfortable were she to read the finished piece. \"Her beauty was that rare kind that made you want to look more like yourself and not like her,\" says one of the more flattering lines, but at another moment she accurately describes the Brooke character as an exhausting, tragically limited person who uses others and bounces from one misconceived venture to another and seems incapable of looking inward. Other people, Tracy writes, avoided her because \"they could feel her failure coming.\" \"Mistress America\" is a very funny and observant movie, albeit squirm-inducing, with quotable dialogue. \"X doesn't roll like that,\" Brooke tells a student that she's tutoring in math, \"because X can't be pinned down.\" The movie starts to crater as soon as Brooke and Tracy and company end up at the modernist house where Dylan and Mimi Clare live, and find Mimi Clare overseeing a reading group for pregnant women; there are some good bits involving a pot stash and a Chipwich and literary affectations, but the length of the sequence, coupled with its essentially static nature, makes the film feel too much like a low-budget talk-fest in which everyone resolves their issues through monologues and revelations. Up until that point, though, it's a breezy and occasionally bracing movie, fun to watch if you're a bit of a masochist, or if you've ever suffered through a weekend or even an hour with people like these, and wondered why you can't hate them, and realized that it's because you probably see a little bit of yourself in them and it scares you.

{"Title": "I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "You can honestly say of this film by writer/director Macon Blair that they don't make 'em like they used to. \"I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore\" is an American independent  film from the 1990s that just happens to have been released this year.  The stakes are small compared to what tends to happen in American movies now; the story is rather slight; the filmmakers pay closer attention to the small details of character interaction than to the fine points of plot. The whole thing is mainly situational: we get to watch the heroine, Ruth Kimke (Melanie Lynskey) as she reacts to having her house broken into and follow along as she decides to locate and punish the people who did it with help from an oddball neighbor (Elijah Wood's Tony), who's enamored with morning stars and nunchucks. Advertisement Really, though, this is a film about the utter indifference and outright hostility that people encounter every day, and how essentially decent people like Ruth suffer and suffer through it, almost always silently, until they finally snap. The break-in is the culmination of a series of unfortunate encounters: she has to deal with an old racist at the nursing home where she works. She gets stuck in traffic and spies a jerk in a pickup truck at the head of the lane whose tailpipe spews inky smoke as he revs his engine. In a scene that will break the hearts of many regulars who read reviews, Ruth enjoys a drink at a neighborhood bar while reading a new book, only to have a plot twist casually spoiled by another customer that she initially mistakes for a nice guy (played by Blair himself).  The movie never escalates beyond a high simmer, though, and once we get to the inevitable (if welcome and satisfying) climax, you may start to tally up all the missed opportunities. Although \"I Don't Feel At Home\" has been compared to \"Falling Down\" for its interest in an ordinary citizen pushed to the breaking point through an accumulation of indignities, the movie it most reminded me of, at least in terms of aspiration, is Jonathan Demme's \"Something Wild,\" a movie which, like this one, is all over the map tonally, veering from sly comedy to knockabout slapstick to much darker passages that verge on thumbscrews-tightening thriller atmospherics. (The initial scene of Ruth discovering her home\u2014which has, as she puts it, been \"violated\"\u2014is ultimately creepier than the finale, even though nothing much happens beyond agonized reactions by Ruth.) The film is worth seeing for its interest in eccentric but realistic people, in particular Ruth, who's played with great intelligence and exactness by Lynskey. Lynskey, who first came to moviegoers' attention in \"Heavenly Creatures,\" is one of those actresses I'm never not glad to see, and it's a treat to see her front-and-center here, carrying an entire movie mainly with her eyes, face and shoulders. A performance like this one can be quite tricky\u2014you're essentially reactive a lot of the time, more of a sponge for the film than the motor driving it along\u2014but Lynskey makes everything active by letting you feel Ruth's emotions and sense her train of thought as she puts various pieces together in her head, drawing correct or wrongheaded conclusions. She's also just a terrific audience surrogate. When she snarls or snaps, I wanted to cheer.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Intruders", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cIntruders,\u201d once called \u201cShut In\u201d on the fest circuit, is\r\nan effective home invasion thriller with interesting performances and tight\r\npacing \u2026 until it\u2019s not.

The result is a promising film that leaves a bad taste in your mouth,\r\nlike a meal well-presented on the plate that just doesn\u2019t fill you up. Advertisement Anna (Beth Riesgraf) is an agoraphobic young woman who hasn\u2019t\r\nleft the family house in a decade. Her brother Conrad (Timothy T. McKinney) is\r\nher only companion, but he\u2019s dying in the film\u2019s opening scenes. A nice Meals\r\non Wheels guy (Rory Culkin) is one of Anna\u2019s few connections to the outside\r\nworld. These opening scenes define Anna\u2019s world well, and Riesgraf is very good\r\nin them, conveying someone who\u2019s actually more scared of going out her front\r\ndoor than anything that might come through it. After her brother\u2019s passing,\r\nRiesgraf deftly conveys Anna\u2019s crippling fear, agoraphobia so bad that it keeps\r\nher from even going to the funeral. And that\u2019s when the problems start. Three guys (Jack Kesy,\r\nJoshua Mikel and Martin Starr) who presumed that Anna would be out of the house\r\nbreak into it to rob the place. Anna is still home, dressed up for the funeral\r\nbut unable to will herself to go. At first, it looks like \u201cIntruders\u201d may play\r\nout like \u201cPanic Room,\u201d as the home invaders realize that someone has altered\r\ntheir plans. However, it\u2019s not long before the tables are turned, leaving the\r\nmen in a basement that\u2019s, well, not your average lower floor. It turns out that\r\nAnna has a dark family history and the men who thought they could steal her\r\nfamily fortune are about to confront it. While the three criminals who bust through Anna\u2019s front door\r\nare relatively and predictably defined\u2014one killer, one peaceful guy, one leader\u2014the\r\ncast and setting sell the action. We believe Anna is so crippled by fear that\r\nher captors don\u2019t even think they have to tie her up to stop her from escaping.\r\nThe filmmaking in this first act is lean and tight, ably propelled by Riesgraf\r\nand the always-great Starr, playing against type here as the maniac who wants to\r\nplunge a hammer into Anna\u2019s head. I could do without the shaky camerawork to\r\ncapture Anna\u2019s fear (the actress is good enough that the trick is unnecessary),\r\nbut I was down with \u201cIntruders\u201d until a major incident at the 30-minute mark\r\ncompletely changes the stakes and dynamic. Advertisement Even then, \u201cIntruders\u201d doesn\u2019t completely fall apart. It\r\njust gets repetitive and even ugly. There\u2019s a lot of use of the word \u201cbitch\u201d\r\nand close-ups of violence. As the piece becomes more \u201cSaw\u201d than \u201cPanic Room,\u201d\r\nthe characters disappear and we\u2019re left with too little to hold on to.\r\nSchindler can\u2019t handle the gore effectively, as scenes like the one in which\r\nblood pours onto Anna\u2019s face just feel gross. It doesn\u2019t need to be that ugly\r\nof a film. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t mind gore at all. It just has to feel\r\npurposeful, and it doesn\u2019t here. And then the final 15 minutes are of the \u201cthat\r\nonly happens in a horror movie\u201d variety, revealing that the psychological\r\nelements of the piece have always been mere window-dressing. People are not so easily defined as we\u2019ve been led to\r\nbelieve. Just because Anna is a shut-in doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s weak. And just because\r\nher home invaders are hammer-wielding tough guys doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t turn\r\nthe tables on them. That\u2019s the aspect of \u201cIntruders\u201d that works, and the\r\nfoundation on which the rest of the film should have been built instead of\r\ninconsistent characters and shock value. You could do a lot worse for a horror\r\nVOD rental this weekend (or even a trip to the theater if it\u2019s near you given\r\nthe abysmal January competition), but you still won\u2019t shake the feeling that \u201cIntruders\u201d\r\nshould have been a lot better.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Samba", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Samba\" (the latest by \"Intouchables\" writing-directing team Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano) is a bizarre, uneven, and strangely charming movie about the bureaucratic nightmare that is illegal immigration in France (and elsewhere, of course, but this is a French story). It's an explosive topic, with multiple layers of complexity and ugliness (xenophobia, racism), all of which is acknowledged in \"Samba,\" but in a muted way, highlighting the absurdity\u00a0of the immigrant experience as opposed to the cruelty\u00a0of it. \"Samba\" is two stories shoehorned into one: a very serious topic handled in a slapstick way. Some viewers may find this jarring or offensive, and it doesn't work a lot of the time, especially when the film attempts to address the despair experienced by law-abiding immigrants just trying to make enough money to send home.\u00a0 Advertisement Samba (Sy) hails from Senegal, and has lived in France for 10 years, working as a dishwasher. The film opens with a long single shot, moving from an elaborate party in a luxurious hotel through the hallways, through the bustling kitchen, and finally into the back room, where we find Samba and others, washing dishes. The shot takes us from a world that is 98% white to a room where everyone is black: a visual choice that tells the story clearer than any language could.\u00a0 Samba has a positive attitude. He has plans for the future, which are derailed when it is discovered his residency papers are not in order. He is placed in a detention center with other illegal immigrants. It is there that Samba meets the shy and incompetent Alice (Charlotte Gainsbourg), a volunteer social worker, new on the job. He asks if she has any sleeping pills. She dumps a veritable pharmacy out onto the table and hands some over. Alice has been warned to never give out her home phone, stay detached. She breaks all of those rules in the first meeting. Alice is assigned to handle Samba's case.\u00a0 When Samba is released from the detention center, he does so with an order to leave France immediately. As he walks down the front path of the center towards the gate, a plane zooms down the runway at the airport opposite and he shouts to the people watching him go, \"Okay, that's my ride! I'm leaving! That's my plane! See? I'm leaving!\" As silly as that might sound (or as offensive, depending on your point of view), it is in those destabilized moments, where comedy is the response to a tragic situation, that \"Samba\" works. Sy makes Samba's positivity and humor a real thing with practical applications, a survival skill. The stakes could not be higher for him, but he utilizes his charm and smarts and sense of the absurd in order to make it through the day.\u00a0 Samba gets odd jobs with his best pal, an immigrant from Brazil named Wilson (the fantastic Tahar Rahim). They work construction, they wash windows. There's a teasing honest energy between the two men. Some of the scrapes they get into (and there are many) could be subtitled \"The Kooky Adventures of Two Charming Handsome Immigrants\" and a little of this goes a long way. They talk about women, sex, they talk about their lives and goals, they talk about how they don't want to go back.\u00a0 A bumbling romance develops between Samba and Alice. Alice is on break from her heavy-duty corporate job. She has anger issues, and self-loathing issues, issues that one can only afford to have when operating from a place of safety and privilege. (There's a great moment in Albert Maysles' final film \"In Transit\": two strangers have struck up a conversation on a long-distance train ride. One of them describes a friend who changed his life because he was \"in transition\" and the guy across the aisle almost laughs out loud. He says that only rich people can afford to be \"in transition,\" the rest of us are too busy for that nonsense.) \"Samba\" would have benefited greatly with a more frank acknowledgment of the disparity of their positions. And ogling at the gorgeous body of an immigrant while he's behind bars is pretty gross in a bald-faced way.\u00a0 Advertisement Gainsbourg overplays Alice's awkwardness, indicating it rather than inhabiting it, but the bond between these two misfits, thrust out of their comfort zones, does have its own sweetness. One of the reasons the love story is successful (to whatever degree it is) is because it is not presented as \"the greatest love the world has ever known\" or \"a sweeping epic romance.\" It's a halting and inarticulate dance between two people drawn to one another because of the given circumstances of their lives at that particular moment. There are comedic moments: a montage of the chaos at a local immigrant social center, the language barriers, the harassed workers, the long lines, the frustration of red tape. One scene where Wilson and Samba flee from the police, involving a precarious escape across the slanted roofs of the neighborhood, is at first hair-raising and then hilarious, as Wilson teases Samba about his fear of heights. Wilson is an enthusiastic ladies' man, causing the more subtle Samba to roll his eyes behind his friend's back. There's a wonderful scene after a party at the local immigrant center, where everyone drinks wine and talks about their hopes and dreams for the future. The scene feels \"caught\" as opposed to \"acted,\" the behavior fresh and spontaneous, the interactions natural. Omar Sy is a star in the truest sense of the word. In 2013, The Guardian called him \"the hottest French film star of 2013,\" due to his role in the smash-hit \"Intouchables\". But lots of actors are called \"the hottest new\" this or that and their acting doesn't justify the hype. Their star-status is a matter of targeted publicity and orchestrated hyperbole. What is it that makes someone a star? There's that indefinable essence stars have, a charisma, an ease, a beauty palpable to the camera, and an ability to let an audience into their inner lives. You know it when you see it; it can't be counterfeited. An actor has to just have\u00a0it and Omar Sy has it. One needs only to watch his performance in \"Samba\" to see Sy's old-school natural star power in its purest form. He's the perfect leading man. He's funny (without straining for jokes), he's truthful, he's vulnerable, he's strong. \"Samba\" doesn't quite work, but the parts of it that do work are due to Sy (with a little help from Rahim). The \"romance\" and \"comedy\" of the genre are present because Sy brings them to life. He almost singlehandedly justifies the film's existence, and that is something only a star can do.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Whole Truth", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "After the success of films like \u201cThe Firm\u201d and \u201cA Time to Kill\u201d in the mid-\u201890s, filmgoers were treated to dozens of Grisham wannabes, films that mimicked the hit author\u2019s legal prose, typically with a twist or two in the final act. Courtney Hunt\u2019s sterile and flat \u201cThe Whole Truth\u201d would have fit perfectly in this lackluster subgenre. Starring Keanu Reeves, Renee Zellweger, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Jim Belushi, almost the entirety of this courtroom drama takes place literally in a courtroom, and the whole thing has the energy of a basic cable TV show. Actually, that\u2019s not fair\u2014most of those have more to say and more of a visual language. Ultimately, there\u2019s nothing offensively bad here\u2014other than a waste of talent who should be doing better work\u2014but it\u2019s so forgettable that you\u2019ll have trouble remembering if you saw it or not when you scroll past it on cable in a few months. Advertisement \u201cThe Whole Truth\u201d opens in the courtroom in which most of the film will take place. We meet an attorney named Ramsey (Reeves), defending an old family friend named Mike (Gabriel Basso), who has been accused of murdering his father Boone (Belushi). When the police arrived on the scene, Mike was crouching over his father\u2019s body, there\u2019s a palm print on the knife that looks like his, and he arguably made a confession. He\u2019s been silent ever since. Zellweger plays Mike\u2019s mother; Mbatha-Raw gets a totally thankless role as Ramsey\u2019s co-counsel. Over the course of the trial, we learn about the dark side of Boone, a man who could be abusive with both his wife and son. Did Mike finally have enough of his abuse? Did he kill his father to protect his mother? Ramsey has no idea because Mike hasn\u2019t said a word about what happened that day. It\u2019s hinted at early on that Mike had an obsession with crime-solving, planting the seed that perhaps there\u2019s more going on than we may expect. And then the film employs a flashback structure that kind of becomes its trick. Ramsey tells us in overwritten narration\u2014and to his co-counsel\u2014that every witness lies. So we see witness testimony that either omits something or flat-out lies, and then we see the truth through flashback. Of course, it all culminates in several final act twists, the last of which makes almost no sense at all. \u201cThe Whole Truth\u201d is filled with lines out of the Grisham playbook (like \u201cThey don\u2019t teach this in law school\u201d) and your enjoyment may come down to how much you\u2019re willing to forgive for the sake of a legal mystery. There\u2019s a whole genre of mass-market paperbacks\u2014I used to call them \u201cairport books\u201d\u2014that work perfectly on a beach or a long flight, when one\u2019s bullshit detector somehow becomes dulled. The script for \u201cThe Whole Truth\u201d is an \u201cairport book,\u201d although it contains even less sizzle and grit than most of those. It's by-the-numbers. Advertisement What\u2019s most surprising about \u201cThe Whole Truth\u201d is that it was helmed by Courtney Hunt, who directed Melissa Leo to an Oscar nomination for \u201cFrozen River\u201d in her debut. Since then, she\u2019s been working in television, including HBO\u2019s \u201cIn Treatment\u201d and, perhaps noteworthy here, NBC\u2019s \u201cLaw & Order: SVU.\u201d If you put \u201cFrozen River,\u201d with its deep character work and excellent use of setting, next to \u201cThe Whole Truth,\u201d I don\u2019t think many people would think they were directed by the same filmmaker. One can only assume that this was a for-hire gig. Maybe it was part of her \u201cSVU\u201d contractual obligation. How she got involved in such a lackluster production is what I'd really like to know the truth behind.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Go for Sisters", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Writer-director John Sayles has been working on the edge of popular acceptance for several decades now, starting with his counterculture drama \"Return of the Secaucus Seven\" and continuing through an \r\nincreasingly ambitious, often sprawling series of ensemble dramas, the best of which is probably \"Lone Star.\" Although he's not above the occasional visual flourish, he's very much a meat-and-potatoes dramatist, more concerned with what people say and do in the moment than in how those words and actions are pictured by the camera. At their worst, his films can seem overly literary, like short stories or novels that just happen to be told with actors. At their best they can have the casually immersive quality of well-made plays or adult, intelligent TV series, with an sharp ear for the rhythms of real speech and an eye for the way people's body language can give away what they secretly desire.  Advertisement Sayles' new thriller \"Go for Sisters\" is stranded somewhere between those two extremes. It's a story of two childhood friends, a parole officer named Bernice (LisaGay \r\nHamilton) and a recovering drug addict named Fontayne (Yolanda Ross), who team up to solve the mysterious disappearance of Bernice's troubled son Rodney, a suspect in a killing. The film's title is explained in a throwaway bit of dialogue early on: as kids, the women were so close and so compatible that other people thought they could \"go for sisters,\" or be related. Their journey takes them across the border into Mexico, where they navigate a grubby underworld of drug dealing and human trafficking with help from a retired cop named Freddy Su\u00e1rez (Edward James Olmos), who has an eye disease and is slowly but surely going blind.  As you can imagine, there's a strong (but mostly subtle) aspect of role reversal here. Bernice, the \"respectable\" one of the friends, steels herself for a dangerous mission and shows that she has the backbone of a street-tough law enforcement officer, despite having gone straight into an administrative job. Fontayne, who's lived her whole adult life on society's seedy fringes, uses that hard-won knowledge for a noble purpose, helping her friend by posing very convincingly as a cop, taking some cues from Freddy but mostly accessing a side of herself she never imagined existed.  Freddy, meanwhile, is acting out his own psychodrama. He's clearly restless in retirement and frustrated by the limitations imposed by his loss of sight; after saying an amusingly quick goodbye to his wife and assuring her that the mission is really not that dangerous, he plunges into a \"case\" that has a touch of seventies movie seediness, with shadowy figures misdirecting the heroes at every turn as they try to solve a puzzle that seems deeper and more confusing by the hour. In theory Freddy is \"helping\" the women, but it's instantly clear that this is a self-serving justification. He needs to be back in the game because it makes him feel whole.  Advertisement Sayles is never better than when he's delving deep into characters working together or at cross purposes, and pointing out how the reasons that people give for doing things are rarely the real reasons. He also gives you a sense that these characters existed long before the film began\u2014that they have tangled personal histories that affect their decisions in the present. There are fine one-off scenes throughout (a wonderful exchange between Olmos and Hector Elizondo, as an old friend who runs a bar, is a standout). He also has a good journalist's eye for cultural details. The Mexico scenes have a different pace and energy than the suburban US scenes, and only occasionally lapse into south-of-the-border-heart-of-darkness cliche (the worst is a scene involving a Chinese immigrant \"snakehead,\" or human trafficker, that verges on Charlie Chan-style sinister orientalism).  The film's plot is articulated cleanly, if a bit too plainly at times, but as is so often the case in Sayles' movies, that's not where the director's interest lies. \"Go for Sisters\" lacks the epic quilt qualities of such sprawling Sayles pictures as \"Lone Star\" or \"City of Hope,\" but this seems more a matter of intent than evidence of any sort of failure of vision.  Sayles' golden period was the\u00a0 '80s and '90s, when a particular sort of American independent film gained unexpected popular traction: one that prized psychology and a sense of place above everything else (\"sex, lies and videotape\" and \"Sling Blade\" are just two examples). \"Go for Sisters\" feels very much like a product of that era. It's warm, incisive but meandering and a bit lumpy at times. Your affection for it will probably depend on how much patience you have for films in that mode. It's the sort of film that isn't afraid of pausing the story to let the characters deliver amusing anecdotes or heartfelt confessions (Bernice tells Fontayne  a story about her martial history that's all the more poignant for being underplayed).  There's even a scene involving Bernice, Fontayne  and Freddy that starts with Freddy rocking out on electric guitar, and telling the women that when his father moved his family from Mexico to the U.S., he decided to get into a rock band because that seemed like a very American thing to do. The camera hangs back without cutting, letting Olmos talk and strum, and part of the delight of the scene is our realization that this scene is probably in there because somebody involved in the production knew that Olmos could really play guitar and thought it would be fun to let him do it.

{"Title": "Amanda Knox", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Netflix\u2019s \u201cAmanda Knox\u201d opens with a gut check statement\r\nabout this case that I hadn\u2019t really considered. There are many reasons that this\r\nnow-almost-decade-old case entranced the world, but chief among them may be\r\nwhat Knox says herself at the open of the film: \u201cEither I\u2019m a psychopath in\r\nsheep\u2019s clothing or I am YOU.\u201d Either this seemingly sweet, na\u00efve girl is\r\nactually a total sociopath\u2014someone who tortured and killed her roommate for fun\u2014or\r\nthis seemingly sweet, na\u00efve girl was accused of something she didn\u2019t do, which\r\nmeans this could happen to anyone. Either situation is terrifying. \u201cAmanda Knox\u201d\r\ndoes an admirable job of detailing the crucial facts of the case. I don\u2019t\r\nsuspect it will persuade anyone convinced that Knox is akin to the Monster of\r\nFlorence, and it undeniably takes a pro-Knox stance, but it\u2019s a well-made,\r\naccomplished piece of filmmaking that works because of how it focuses such a\r\nlarge case down to its key players, thereby illuminating how something like\r\nthis could happen to anyone. Advertisement In November of 2007, Amanda Knox was living in Perugia,\r\nItaly with her British roommate Meredith Kercher. She claimed that she came\r\nhome after spending the night with her boyfriend Rafael Sollecito to find a\r\nbloodbath. The window was broken and Kercher\u2019s throat had been cut. There was\r\nblood everywhere and there were even feces in the toilet. A year later, Rudy\r\nGuede was convicted of murdering Kercher\u2014the feces belonged to him and his DNA\r\nwas all over the scene. And yet the local cops never gave up their theory that Knox\r\nand maybe Sollecito were also involved. Why? Well, first there\u2019s the way Knox behaved the day the\r\nbody was found. She came home and showered before she found Kercher\u2019s body\u2014which\r\nthe police found odd. And she was caught by cameras kissing Sollecito while the\r\npolice were handling the scene. She didn\u2019t seem to be handling the discovery \u201cnormally,\u201d\r\nas if that\u2019s an easy thing to define for a 20-year-old girl in a foreign\r\ncountry. The next day, when she was brought back to the scene by prosecutor Giuliano\r\nMignini, who is introduced in the film comparing himself to Sherlock Holmes in\r\ncase you need to know about his ego, Knox had something of a breakdown,\r\nsmacking her ears and screaming. Mignini became convinced she was remembering\r\nkilling Kercher. The Italian cops interrogated and allegedly abused Knox until\r\nshe confessed.  Amanda Knox tells horrifying stories of her treatment by the\r\nItalian police, including being slapped in the head by them and told she had\r\nHIV. And if that abusive invasion of privacy wasn\u2019t enough, the media jumped\r\ninto the same pool, personified in the film by Daily Mail journalist Nick Pisa,\r\na morally dubious fellow who admits to being given Knox\u2019s prison diary and\r\npublishing passages from it and then speaks of \u201cjournalistic principles\u201d when\r\nasked how he got it. The media industry turned Knox\u2019s sexuality into a weapon\u2014she\r\nwas scolded for her supposed immorality and that was used as the basis for the prosecution's version of the crime. And the number of half-truths and lies printed by people like Pisa is\r\nstaggering. At one point, he says \u201cIt\u2019s not like I could double check\u201d because\r\nthat means someone else would run the story first. He still sees Knox as a \"story\" instead of a human being. Advertisement There was almost no trace of Knox\u2019s DNA in any\r\nessential part of this case\u2014and the DNA that did convict her at one point was\r\nlater deemed inconsequential or contaminated\u2014and Guede\u2019s DNA was all over the scene.\r\nSo you have to believe that she cleaned up the scene perfectly but not her\r\nco-killer\u2019s feces in the toilet or she committed the crime in a hazmat suit.\r\nAnd yet people like Mignini consistently dismiss these kind of factual questions\r\nwith comments about what they could tell by looking in Knox\u2019s eyes. He even\r\ncalls himself a prophet in his own country after the first conviction. This\r\nwasn\u2019t a story of justice or murder. It was a story of men who saw a way to use\r\na girl to further their own careers, as prosecutors and journalists. Again, if you think Amanda Knox is a masterful criminal,\r\nsomeone who got away with murder, this film is unlikely to convince you\r\notherwise. Most of this information has been available before\u2014although some of\r\nthe first-hand accounts of the interrogations from Knox and Sollecito are new.\r\nIt\u2019s just seeing it all presented in one, impactful film that one can view the\r\nscope of the whole story. Whether you think she did it or not, \u201cAmanda Knox\u201d is\r\na horror story that should be told.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Get Hard", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "If you love rape jokes, \"Get Hard\" is your movie.  This film about a car wash manager, Darnell (Kevin Hart), helping a convicted hedge fund manager prepare for a stint in maximum security prison is driven by fear of non-consensual buggery, mostly at the hands of looming African-American prisoners with deep voices. At its core, the story is about a wimpy White man's fear of being owned and \"turned out\" by Black men\u2014treated as a \"bitch,\" to use a word both characters employ pretty much constantly. The script has the hedge fund manager \"training\" for prison by bulking up, and learning to carry himself with more confidence, and fight, and talk \"black.\" None of this will be a surprise to anyone who's seen the subway and bus poster, which shows the hedge fund manager, James, seated, his face frozen in a not-so-secretly terrified fake scowl, while the car wash owner Darnell stands behind him, braiding his hair into cornrows.  Advertisement Before we go further, let the record reflect that nothing about this material is inherently unacceptable. To quote the title of a Steve Martin album, comedy isn't pretty.\u00a0Few things are more antithetical to the idea of art\u2014not to mention more unfunny and boring\u2014than a comedy that's mainly concerned with proving how sensitive it is. Comedy can work in a lot of different modes and be funny, provocative, even brilliantly incisive. One of those modes is \"tear the lid off the id and watch the razor-toothed fishies swim around.\"\u00a0   That happens to be the mode that great R-rated comedies like \"Blazing Saddles,\" \"Stir Crazy,\" \"Office Space,\" \"Friday,\" Roberto Benigni's \"Monster,\" and the similar but vastly superior \"Let's Go to Prison\" all worked in. (\"Would you like some Merlot?\" Chi McBride's inmate asks his \"Let's Go to Prison\" lover. \"I made it in the toilet.\") This is the mode that \"Get Hard\" tries to work in, too. The film isn't set in an ideal world, but an exaggerated version of the world we're actually stuck with. This world is racist, homophobic, sexist, and a whole lot of \r\nother -ics and -ists. It's also driven by an urge for alpha male \r\ndominance, expressed through economic violence as well as prison rape. Somewhere in the \"Get Hard\" screenplay is a terrific if troubling germ of an idea: a\r\n rich, crooked white man is terrified that members of the American \r\nunderclass will literally rape him, as his pals have been economically raping them for generations.  It's all fair game for Cohen. Too bad his skills are lacking. The first-time director's resume includes co-writing Ben Stiller's \"Tropic \r\nThunder,\" which wrung laughs from a white actor (Robert Downey, Jr.) in \r\nblackface, a Gentile actor (Tom Cruise) playing an outrageously greedy \r\nand grotesque Jewish agent, and a monologue about how Hollywood movie \r\nstars play characters with Down syndrome to prove their versatility \r\n(\"never go full retard\"). \"Thunder\" suffered from the \"Get\r\n Hard\" problem of trying to have its politically incorrect cake and eat \r\nit, too: Downey's and Cruise's characters were minstrel show doodles enclosed by air quotes. But it had moments of scathing insight, and it \r\nnever entirely forgot that its main target of opportunity was the entitled cluelessness of Hollywood's elite. Cohen casts the \"Get Hard\" panic net wide enough to include Mexican-American gangbangers and white supremacists (showcased in a set-piece that seems modeled on the classic bit in \"48 HRS\" where Eddie Murphy intimidates a bar full of rednecks). And its distaste for the rich swells has a peculiar but appealing kind of outdated Bowery Boys populism: James's people aren't just wealthy, they're movie-wealthy, hanging out on yachts and golf courses and in the dining rooms of country clubs, and attending banquets where string quartets are interrupted by champagne toasts. Advertisement Unfortunately, \"Get Hard\" rarely rises to the level of \"Tropic Thunder\"'s better bits. Much of it plays as though a filmmaker who grew up watching \"Stir Crazy\" on HBO thought the scene where Richard Pryor taught Gene Wilder to walk and talk Black would be better if it lasted 90 minutes instead of 90 seconds. The film's not as clever as it seems to think it is. Certainly it's not clever enough to handle provocative, even explosive material without seeming cynical and opportunistic. It's a reactionary film posing as a provocative but basically liberal one. A lot of the time it acts as though it's boldly seeing through mindsets that it is actually just unveiling for the zillionth time. It wants us to think it's critiquing racism and cultural stereotypes, but that's mainly a pose\u2014a pretext to get laughs from Will Ferrell dressed in \"street\" clothes, babbling barely coherent slang, and apologetically insisting \"I'm not trying to appropriate your culture.\" (Few entertainment trends are as obnoxious as white \"liberal\" comedians being \"ironically\" bigoted, while tacitly telling audiences, \"We all know nobody in this room is racist, so laugh it up!\")   The film is also casually homophobic: at one point, Darnell gives up on teaching James to act tough and brings him to \"the number one gay\r\n pickup spot\" in Los Angeles so that he can learn to perform fellatio in the men's room. And it's misogynist, too. James's fiancee, played by Alison Brie of \"Community,\" is a castrating harpy, and her counterpart on the underclass side of the fence, a young groupie who hangs with a street gang, fares no better\u2014though at least Darnell's wife Rita (Edwina Findley) and daughter Makayla (Ariana Neal) come across as human beings rather than hateful parasites in their limited screen time.  Ferrell and Hart have their moments: the former once again displays his gift for surreal, improvised blurting, and the scene where Hart acts out a hypothetical encounter between a Black inmate, a Latino inmate and a gay hustler in a prison yard is Pryor-level great. But such moments are oases in a tedious whole, and none of them can dispel the feeling that \"Get Hard\" is trying to put one over on its audience and getting away with it.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Blackhat", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Michael Mann is an action filmmaker even when his characters are standing still. His movies contemplate themselves: they are simultaneously about what's happening and what it means. They're sensitive to the intellectual and emotional undercurrents swirling around the characters, whether they're running, driving, punching and shooting, or just brooding in close-up while electronic music shimmers and drones.  All of which makes him an oddly ideal director for \"Blackhat,\" a solemn, grandiose, often ludicrous thriller in which \"Thor\" star Chris Hemsworth plays a buff computer hacker helping a joint team of FBI and Chinese intelligence agents chase cyberterrorists through Chicago, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, and Jakarta. Slick and sometimes goofy as it is, \"Blackhat\" is an odd, fascinating movie: a high-tech action thriller about the human condition. I can think of no better current illustration of the notion that, to quote this site's founder, it's not what a movie is about, it's how it's about it. Advertisement \"Blackhat\" is far from a perfect movie, mind you. Its rock-solid confidence in technical details isn't matched by similarly exacting attention to plot mechanics. Key roles are miscast or underwritten. Hemsworth's character, Nicholas Hathaway\u2014a keyboard wizard furloughed from prison to help catch cyberterrorists who are stealing fortunes and wrecking nuclear plants\u2014is implausibility Exhibit \"A.\" \"Blackhat\" contrives a biography to justify this genius autodidact who reads Michel Foucault after lights-out, delivers mirrored epigrams in a Noo Yawk accent (\"I did the time; time isn't doing me\"), has Thor's chest and abs (push-ups, baby!), and can fight and shoot like John Wick and navigate irradiated nuclear plants in a hazmat suit. Despite Hemsworth's magnetism, Hathaway remains more a checklist of awesome than a credible person. The same is true, to a lesser extent, of his partners in justice, a racially and internationally diverse bunch. Their ranks include the sensitive/fearsome brother-sister duo of Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang) and Lien Chen (Wei Tang) and FBI agents Henry Pollack (John Ortiz), Mark Jessup (Holt McCallany) and Carol Barrett (Viola Davis). More so than in most Mann pictures\u2014and this is saying a lot\u2014these characters are more often lit and posed than explored.  Sometimes this feels like the right approach. The film spares us the usual \"partners hate each other at \r\nfirst, then learn to work together\" cliche by establishing that Hathaway\r\n and Chen were college roommates who love and respect each other; their embrace after reconnecting is shorthand that lets us instantly accept their Crockett-and-Tubbs-styled two-brained hive mind. The semi-obligatory love story between Hathaway and Lien is a\u00a0 Wong-Kar Wai oasis amid the snooping and chasing, all sexy smiles and furtive embraces. Leehom Wang's elegance is intoxicating: he glides across the screen like a dancer, necktie rippling.  Other times, though, you'll wish \"Blackhat\" had given every character another minute or two of attention, to make them pop like the crooks and cops in \"Heat\" and \"Collateral.\" If you buy them anyhow, it's because the actors have committed to the movie's hallucinatory intensity while still projecting eccentric, personal qualities (Davis is a standout; her side-eye could be registered as a weapon), and because this is a rare thriller that creates a worldview to go with its world.  You could call this movie \"Michael Mann's Greatest Hits\" and mean it as a\r\n slam or a compliment, depending on your feelings about the director\u2014but all the hits have been remixed and rethought. \r\nAs written by Mann and \r\nMorgan Davis Foehl, photographed by Stuart Dryburgh (\"The Piano,\" \r\n\"Ameila\"), \r\nand cut by a team of editors,\r\n \"Blackhat\" has enough fighting, shooting and brooding to \r\nsatisfy fans\r\n of \"Collateral\" and \"Heat,\" plus a \r\nbumper \r\ncrop of trademark Mann images: daytime and nighttime skylines, \r\nexistentially empty roads, cops and criminals posed against \r\npost-industrial landscapes, soul-mates having deep conversations in restaurants, reflections in rear-view \r\nmirrors and picture windows, brazenly off-center closeups, \r\nbespoke suits and \r\ndesigner sunglasses. These Mann-erisms feel newly poignant because they're celebrating light, space, architecture and flesh, even as the movie's heroes obsess over virtual conspiracies, and keep an eye peeled for coldblooded killers dispatched by hidden masters.  Advertisement The world of ones and zeros that the \"The Matrix\" showed us \r\n15 years ago is no longer fanciful. \"Blackhat\" is mainly about what happens when the real world is \r\nannexed by the virtual: what it does to geography and relationships; how it signal-jams our species' sense of time as a \r\nseries of self-contained moments, and substitutes an existence that \r\ncan feel like an endless, intrusive buzz.\u00a0When \"Blackhat\" goes silent\u2014as when the camera settles on lovers' hands in post-coital closeup, or when the newly furloughed Hathaway pauses on \r\nairport tarmac and savors the open space\u2014it's powerful, because you've been given a gift rarely bestowed in the world beyond the movie theater: a moment's peace. The movie is a sound and light show, first and foremost, but it's also a sneaky eulogy for a dying way of living and seeing: rage, rage against the dying of the real! The filmmaking prods you to contemplate the physicality, the tangibility, of what's onscreen\u2014to think about actions as actions, people as people, things as things. Sunlight and streetlamps are searingly bright, gunshots are deafening, landscapes and skylines awesomely vast. When men grapple in a cramped diner and someone's head smashes against a table, or when Hathaway repeatedly slams the flat end of an axe-head against a metal screen, or when bullets rip through a cargo container or a screwdriver plunges into a man's neck, you flinch, not just because the sound effects are loud and the camerawork tactically \"messy,\" but because these primordial actions are contrasted against the electronic violence carried out by unseen cyber-criminals. The bad guys don't directly assault existing facilities, organizations and institutions; they undermine or confuse them until they implode, bringing in gunmen only when absolutely necessary. The film's prologue is the best example of virtual treachery causing actual mayhem. It's a gem of wordless exposition that finds a visual/metaphorical way to explain how hackers slip past electronic firewalls and spread a malware virus into nuclear plant's computer system, shutting off cooling fans and causing core rods to overheat. You don't have to know much about computers to understand what's happening. You can figure it out by watching CGI images of pulsing dots swimming through fiber-optic cables and circuit boards (in point-of-view shots that evoke a Stalker Cam in a horror film or the shark in \"Jaws\"), then spreading and multiplying like cancer cells.\u00a0 Advertisement There are more such moments connecting the virtual and \"real,\" like the scene where Hathaway intuits that somebody's spying on him and a colleague in a restaurant, then gets up from the table and wanders through the service area (in a long, unbroken handheld shot) until he locates the surveillance camera control board that's feeding images off-site. The movie's climax is a time-machine trip, catapulting us from the 21st century to maybe the 18th. It's intimate, emotional, vicious: flesh is punctured, blood spilled. As Davis' character puts it: \"Is that tangible enough for you?\"", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Founder", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cThe Founder\u201d is mesmerized by its hero, McDonald\u2019s chain founder Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), but horrified by how he built his empire. That kind of ambivalence is great; in fact it\u2019s a hallmark of good drama. But there are too many moments when \u201cThe Founder\u201d becomes a business-drama variant of that war film problem identified by Francois Truffaut: it\u2019s hard to make a truly anti-war film because war is inherently cinematic, and when you show it, people get swept up in the action anyway. The bloodshed in the business drama is (usually) figurative, but the conflict is still thrilling, and so a lot of films about business end up grappling with Truffaut's war movie problem. \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross,\u201d \u201cWall Street,\u201d \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d \u201cBoiler Room\u201d and the like are filled with the kinds of people you'd cross a room to avoid, yet you hear their lines quoted by businesspeople and b-school students as inspirational texts, probably because it's more fun to identify with the bastard who gets things done than the people who suffer from his actions. Ray Kroc is a local Chamber of Commerce version of Gordon Gekko. Keaton plays him with such laser-beam focus that even when the movie is appalled by Ray's shady maneuvers, it still leans on his every word.  Advertisement As written by Robert Siegel (\u201cThe Wrestler\u201d), directed by John Lee Hancock (\u201cThe Rookie\u201d) and acted by Keaton, Kroc at first seems a riff on \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d hero Willy Loman, or one of the real estate strivers in \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d who say they can't close deals because the leads are weak. We see him cold-calling restaurant owners and trying to sell them mixers out of the trunk of his car, then returning home to get pep talks from his wife Ethel (Laura Dern). By the end of the tale, he\u2019s become the Charles Foster Kane of hamburgers\u2014a bland megalomaniac surrounded by enablers and worshipers, ruling a corporation that he built by exploiting the optimism and trust of McDonald\u2019s originators Richard and Maurice McDonald (Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch), who were bought out at a too-low price and robbed of future royalties after accepting a handshake agreement that Kroc never honored.\u00a0 The film\u2019s depiction of the McDonald brothers is devastating, far and away the strongest thing in \u201cThe Founder.\u201d Every stop on their road to ruin is flagged and catalogued, from their decision to let Kroc expand into other states to their capitulation to production and profit-making ideas that they fear will turn the restaurant from a profitable but self-contained labor of love into a purveyor of unfrozen beef patties and powdered shakes. The movie does such a good job of showing the brothers\u2019 bond as a relationship founded on can-do spirit that when Kroc enters the picture, lavishing praise on their idea for a \u201cfast food\u201d restaurant with an assembly line service model, you can see why they\u2019d quit resisting his vision of a centralized franchise.\u00a0 Up until to the point where documents get signed and large sums start changing hands, the film treats Kroc as a sad sack chasing one last shot at redemption, so we\u2019re not surprised that the McDonald brothers would see that in him as well, and be moved to make his fairy tale (and theirs\u2014they failed to build their own chain) come true. (Offerman and Lynch, two of the best character actors alive, top themselves here; each has several close-ups so filled with betrayal and regret that even the film seems awed by their power.) Advertisement Siegel\u2019s script treats Kroc as the embodiment of a certain way of looking at American business values: smiley-faced positive, forever treating capitalism as a pure virtue that does so much good for society that its casualties are unimportant. On the road, Kroc repeats inspirational phrases he memorized from a self-help record. He believes in them as a cleric believes in a sacred text. His conversations with other characters are filled with formulations that you might hear from the mouth of a cult leader. They\u2019re bold and startling but also self-serving and cynical, as when he tells the brothers that he wants the McDonald\u2019s logo to be as ubiquitous as the American flag and the cross: \u201cThe new American church \u2026 Feeding bodies, feeding souls.\u201d\u00a0 And yet despite his blatant opportunism, Kroc sees himself as an idealist and myth-maker, not a huckster. He\u2019s not a knowingly evil person. But there\u2019s a void at his center\u2014which, \u201cThe Founder\u201d suggests, might be as much a requirement for legendary business success as the persistence that Kroc's self-help record keeps praising. (An especially deft screenwriting touch: Kroc, who claims the McDonalds\u2019 brothers\u2019 food service concepts as his own and ultimately steals their name, is shown repeating the \u201cpersistence\u201d speech in a business award speech without attribution.) Unfortunately, \u201cThe Founder\u201d often articulates its ideas in a tedious way, by having its characters deliver reams of exposition (some of it aided by documentary footage and old photos) in place of real conversations. The first third of the film is so thick with slide-show storytelling that it plays like a celebratory video that could be screened at a convention of McDonald\u2019s franchisees. The film also has such trouble integrating the business story with Kroc\u2019s tumultuous personal life\u2014he divorced Ethel for a younger woman named Joan (Linda Cardellini)\u2014that its women end up being defined by their level of support for Kroc\u2019s vision. The McDonald brothers are secondary characters, too, but they\u2019re fleshed out as individuals. You can picture their lives apart from (and before) Kroc. That\u2019s not the case with Ethel (a wet blanket, despite Dern's best efforts) or Joan (who likens Kroc to Alexander the Great not as a warning but as a compliment).   Advertisement Had \"The Founder\" focused solely on Kroc\u2019s relationship with the McDonald brothers, it might have been one of the great intimate, sour character studies of recent times. All the stuff with Kroc on the road acting like a beleaguered Jack Lemmon character and the scenes with his first wife nagging him and second-guessing him feel like attempts to will a three-dimensional, somewhat sympathetic biography into existence, even though the material resists it. The nagging suspicion that the filmmakers could not help but succumb to the charisma of Ray Kroc (or Michael Keaton?) lingers through the final stretch of \u201cThe Founder,\u201d which tries to visualize a hypnotic emotional void in the spirit of \u201cRaging Bull\u201d or \u201cThere Will Be Blood\" without laying the proper groundwork for it. (This film could have been titled \u201cThere Will Be Beef.\u201d) Still, I\u2019d be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t thought about \"The Founder\" constantly since seeing it. It's possible that a sharper, bleaker, more articulate film might not have resonated as strongly as this messy, self-canceling one. It's an ad that becomes a warning before circling around and becoming another, darker kind of advertisement, and one of the most intriguing and surprising things about \"The Founder\" is that, in the end, it seems vaguely ashamed of itself for letting this happen. Kroc steals the movie from Hancock and Siegel just like he stole McDonald's from the McDonald brothers. I guess you could say it stole my objections, too. I left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth. Then I went to McDonald\u2019s for the first time in over a year and ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese and a vanilla shake.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Flower", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "Juno plus Lolita equals \"Flower,\" an indie drama about Erica (Zoey Deutch), a spunky-profane, sexually active, criminally ambitious 17-year old from the San Fernando Valley. Directed and co-written by Max Winkler (son of actor Henry Winkler), the movie is a Frankenstein quilt of not-quite-there-ness. Almost nothing convinces\u2014not the story, not the script's view of human nature, not the dialogue, not even Erica, a young woman who's at the center of every scene, and is presented as a force of nature who's as beguiling and funny as she is relentless, even though, very often, she's none of those things. The cast's heroic exertions fail to save \"Flower\" from its own worst tendencies. Advertisement \"Flower\" starts with Erica performing oral sex on a local police officer as part of an ongoing blackmail scheme that keeps her and her two best pals, Kala (Dylan Gelula) and Claudine (Maya Eshet), in shopping money while adding to a fund to bail Erica's absentee dad out of jail. Erica's mother Laurie (Kathryn Hahn) is dating a nice single dad named Bob (Tim Heidecker). Bob's teenage son, an overweight and painfully shy recovering drug addict named Luke (Joey Morgan), leaves rehab and moves in, prompting Erica to try to get to know him Erica-style, by making a lot of knowing wisecracks and then offering oral sex to chill him out. \"I like sucking dick, it wouldn't be a burden,\" she assures him. She does this sort of thing a lot. \"Flower\" expends quite a bit of screen time on Erica's nonchalance about oral sex, playing it either for laughs (she keeps a sketchbook of all the penises she's serviced) or pathos, always keeping things cute or sweet, never delving deep enough into Erica's psyche to show how damaged a teenager must be to live that kind of life. The film is queasily fascinated by her sexuality, and sometimes veers perilously close to getting off on it (as in a sequence where Erica dances to loosen up Luke, at one point clinging to a pole like a stripper). This is a different proposition from exploring a teenager's sexuality, as many superior independent films, not all of them directed by women, have done before. From there, \"Flower\" turns into a teenage bonding story, with an unstable, ultimately grotesque undertone of voyeuristic fascination. Luke declines Erica's offer of a therapeutic hummer, telling her that he's been a barely-functioning person since childhood, when he was molested by a man who happens to frequent the bowling alley where Erica and her friends hang out. His name is Will Jordan (Adam Scott), but Erica calls him Hot Old Guy. Another blackmail scheme is hatched, driven not just by greed but a desire for payback\u2014and in one of the film's only intriguing twists, it's Erica who wants vengeance, on her possible future stepbrother's behalf. Whether this is a perverse attempt at bonding or the result of Erica projecting her submerged anger against her absentee father and various johns is left ambiguous\u2014a rare example of restraint in a movie that otherwise never misses an opportunity to explain its characters to us. Advertisement Luke says no to Erica's plan at first, but she keeps hammering away at him. \"Shaking down a child molester is our moral obligation,\" she insists. \"If we don't act now, then other little boys might get butt-raped like little Lukey over here, and then 15 years from now they'll be popping pills and eating their feelings, too.\" Reaching for a pop culture comparison, she asks Luke, \"What would Batman and Robin do if they saw the Joker sticking his finger up little boys' assholes?\" Despite all the disgust she beams in Will's general direction, she's clearly infatuated with him, to the point where her crusade on Luke's behalf starts to seem like a pretext to add one more drawing to her sketchbook. The heroine is the movie's least convincing character, and that's a serious problem. Where every other individual in \"Flower\" seems like a person who could exist, at least in theory\u2014and the exquisitely observed details of working-class life do much to sell the film's world to us\u2014Erica remains an abstraction, the sum total of her quirks, from that penis sketchbook to her pet rat Titty Boy, who eats Hot Cheetos and watches \"Sixteen and Pregnant\" with her and sometimes sits inside a carrying case resting on her stomach while Erica suns herself on a swimming pool's diving board like Ben Braddock in \"The Graduate.\"\u00a0She's a bundle of attitudes and tics who never comes into focus as an actual\u00a0teenage girl, however stylized or emblematic or larger-than-life she was intended to be.\u00a0 In the end, Erica exemplifies a female character type that critic Nathan Rabin dubbed the \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl,\" who \"exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures.\" The character can be seen in\u00a01930s screwball comedies like \"Bringing Up Baby,\" in\u00a0such post-millennial films as \"Garden State\" and \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" and in\u00a0Jonathan Demme's 1986 road film \"Something Wild,\" about a repressed\u00a0Yuppie bore who loosens up after a free spirit lures him into a wild, sexy, dangerous adventure. (\"Flower\" fesses up to its \"Something Wild\" fixation by eventually having Luke and Erica don wigs the same color as Melanie Griffith and Jeff Daniels' hair in Demme's movie.)\u00a0 Advertisement At its best, this kind of character can become the engine driving a film, even if she only makes sense as half of a couple. At its worst, the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is a phony life force:\u00a0an intellectual screenwriter's dirty-wacky fantasy.\u00a0This film\u00a0puts the Manic Pixie Dream Girl character at the heart of the story for its\u00a0first two-thirds, only to dis-empower and marginalize her, reducing\u00a0her to a prize to be claimed by the anguished, ruddy-faced Luke, who starts out emasculated and introverted but becomes bolder and more decisive as the storyline darkens and grows violent. \"Flower\" turns out to be a stealth male rescue fantasy. The damsel-in-distress thinks she's the hero of the story, but she's mainly the catalyst for a troubled young man's catharsis, just like every other film in this genre. \"Flower\" is cloying, simplistic, clueless, and indifferent to most of the suffering that it chronicles. It only comes alive in a handful of dramatic showpiece moments that are likely the reason the actors signed on to do the movie (Scott and Hahn win Best in Show), but these are unfortunately hamstrung by intrusive underscoring that seems meant to take the sting out of a movie that needs all the sting can get. Deutch overplays Erica as a wisecracking femme tomboy, telegraphing every \"outrageous\" line and cheeky reaction, pushing her right up to the edge of caricature in a borderline-Nicolas-Cage-like way, as if trying to force the movie to become the bad-taste comedy-drama that it probably needed to be in order to succeed. It's a bold play that doesn't work, but it's more compelling than anything the script or direction can offer.\u00a0 The ending is oblivious to the human cost of the wild schemes perpetrated by Erica, Luke and the others. This would be wickedly delightful if the film were a satire on disturbed, selfish people, but it shows no signs of having that sort of self-awareness. Mostly it's incompetent. To say that the final scene is as chilling as anything in \"Badlands\" or \"Natural Born Killers\" would be high praise if \"Flower\" seemed even the slightest bit aware of how sociopathic it seems at that moment. If you could pour the worst tendencies of American independent cinema over the last twenty years into a gigantic soup tureen and let it simmer overnight, this film would be the unappetizing result.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Inside", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "The 2007 French film \u201cInside\u201d is considered by many to be the peak of the French Horror Wave of the last decade (which also includes must-sees in Alexandre Aja\u2019s \u201cHigh Tension,\u201d David Moreau and Xavier Palud\u2019s \u201cIls,\u201d Pascal Laugier\u2019s \u201cMartyrs,\u201d and more). As every horror fan knows, with great foreign success comes the inevitable American remake, and so here we are a decade later with Miguel \u00c1ngel Vivas\u2019 long-delayed retelling of the story of a terrifying home invasion perpetrated on a pregnant woman. The 2018 version is admittedly more competently made than a lot of quickie VOD remakes but never justifies its existence, inexplicably softening the impact of the first film.\u00a0 Advertisement Sarah Clark (Rachel Nichols) is very, very pregnant. While driving at night with her husband, she feels a kick, and gets into a horrific car accident. Now, she\u2019s a very, very pregnant widow. Alone one rainy night not long after, she hears a loud knock on the door. It\u2019s a woman who claims she just wants to use her phone, but Sarah is instantly suspicious. When the unnamed woman (Laura Harring) reveals she knows Sarah\u2019s not telling the truth about her husband being asleep, it\u2019s clear she has malevolent intentions. And things get much worse from there. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game in which the cat is desperately trying to get the mouse\u2019s baby, and the mouse is going into labor.    This is essentially the set-up for the original version of \u201cInside\u201d as well, but the differences, at least at first, are in style. The first \u201cInside\u201d is one of the goriest films ever made. It has earned the title of \u201ctorture porn\u201d from some viewers, and is most certainly not for the faint of heart or soft of stomach. This version of \u201cInside\u201d is relatively tame. Sure, there are some stabbings but nothing like the washed-in-red aesthetic of the film that came before. To compensate for the lack of gore, Vivas resorts to cheap filmmaking techniques like herky-jerky camera movements and an overcooked score. It\u2019s a movie that\u2019s constantly telegraphing its intention to scare you without actually doing so, especially in a midsection that feels like it\u2019s dragging its feet just as the movie needs to be building suspense. Nichols and Harring give the film more than it deserves, but their work is wasted on a movie that doesn\u2019t know what story it\u2019s telling.\u00a0 There are hints that Vivas may have wanted to make a Hitchcock riff, especially in a scene where Sarah tries to get help from a neighbor that recalls \u201cRear Window,\u201d but this tonal choice never got his full commitment. Inevitably, \u201cInside\u201d feels like it\u2019s going through the motions, especially for people who remember the twist ending from the original. I tried to put myself in the shoes of a viewer who would be surprised by it, although I feel like this version makes it so obvious that most people will have figured it out anyway. But whether you're new to \"Inside\" or a fan of the original, the change that Vivas and his team do make to the ending will leave you scratching your head.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Taken 3", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "After racking up a daunting body count in both France (\"Taken\") and Turkey (\"Taken 2\"), the destructive Mills family (who really should consider going into the witness protection program, not only for their own safety, but for ours) turn their sights on the sunny freeways of their home town, Los Angeles, in \"Taken 3\". Starting with the unimaginative (and, as it happens, incorrect) title, \"Taken 3,\" directed by Oliver Megaton, is both lazy and tremendously overwrought. Anchored, as always, by a sincere performance by Liam Neeson, as well as the additional gravitas provided by Forest Whitaker as the police officer tracking Neeson down, the film pulses with indifference. \"Taken\" and \"Taken 2\" were preposterous, but entertaining: care had been given to the plot as well as the filming so that they worked as thrillers. Many didn't care for the sequel, but I liked it a lot, especially the cinematic use of the architecture in Istanbul, which showed a real understanding for how action happening in a very specific landscape can be exciting and suspenseful. \"Taken 3\" doesn't want to take the time to set things up carefully or clearly, so that while you can perceive that you are on the highway out to Malibu, or careening along the 405, the film doesn't use the specific landscape or architecture to help tell its story. It's just a frantic, flash-cutting frenzy. Even the slower, more intimate family scenes feature so many swooping-up-from-below shots and so many sudden inserts that moments (emotional or physical) are never given a chance to land.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Taken\" and \"Taken 2\" were abduction dramas, featuring first the abduction of a daughter, then an ex-wife, by nefarious international criminals. \"Taken 3\" also has international criminals, but changes the formula, and from here on out there will be spoilers. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) lives in Los Angeles, playing golf with his Special Ops buddies, and providing support to his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), who is unhappy in her marriage to sweaty Stuart (Dougray Scott) and reaches out to Bryan for comfort and bagels and maybe something more. Their daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is in college now, and Bryan still thinks of her as a baby (even though her professional stunt-driver skills in \"Taken 2\" should have clued him in that she is a highly capable human, not to mention her ability to run across the tilting rooftops of Istanbul, lobbing grenades at innocent parking lots in order to signal her location). But then Lenore shows up dead, and Bryan is falsely accused of her murder. Instead of staying around to defend himself against the charges, he disappears into Los Angeles, a fugitive on the run. Because Bryan is the most resourceful man on the planet (he makes MacGyver look like a slacker), his is not the desperate everyman-on-the-run plight of Richard Kimble of \"The Fugitive\". Oh no, Bryan hacks into security cameras, downloads GPS information from stolen cars, has access to world-class weaponry as well as the support of his super-spy friends. Cop Franck Dotzler (Whitaker) pursues Bryan, always one step behind, frustrated, but also somewhat amused at the ingenuity of his foe. Dotzler warns his cops to not underestimate Mills; he's a ghost, a phantom, a mastermind! Bryan is determined to run his own investigation and anyone who gets in his way must be demolished. That includes a poor hospital security guard, the students at Kim's university and the rent-a-cop hired to drive Bryan back to the station.\u00a0 Granted, nobody enjoys the \"Taken\" films because they are grounded in reality, but \"Taken 3\" pushes that envelope so far that the overall effect is numbing. Bryan is so indestructible that he survives a car crash that nobody could survive (with nary a scratch on him), and is able to dodge the bullets of an automatic weapon firing at him from only three feet away.\u00a0 The number of cuts per scene is astronomical, ensuring that the audience never gets a chance to orient itself in the environment, or, for that matter, care about what is happening. Liam Neeson is impressive physically, but the fight scenes are filmed with so many cuts that the action itself is never clear. In one car chase scene, involving multiple police cars, an 18-wheeler, and the various commuters on the road, a car commandeered by Mills ends up driving the wrong way down a crowded freeway. At least I think that's what I was seeing. The coked-up editing makes it impossible to tell, and it made me yearn, longingly, for the classic car chase scene in \"To Live and Die in L.A.,\" also involving a car barreling the wrong way down a freeway. That visceral, gripping scene in \"To Live and Die in L.A.\" was filmed so specifically that the audience never loses its orientation in space. Effective car chase scenes involve care in the execution: it's not enough to show a car flipping over in slo-mo, surrounding it with 100 quick edits designed to disorient. Ironically, that approach ends up making it look like the movie is trying too hard.\u00a0 Advertisement The best moments in \"Taken 3\", strangely enough, are the repeated swooping aerial shots that move the predictable plot forward. For a moment, just a moment, the camera stays on one thing (the freeway, the downtown skyscrapers, a pier on the beach, the canal) \u2026 and, for that moment, the film is gracious enough to provide us with visual perspective, to let us know where we are in space. Unfortunately, those aerial shots also give us time to think thoughts like, \"Maybe I should pop in 'The Fugitive' or 'To Live and Die in L.A.' Those movies did it better.\"", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"So began a battle that none had expected; and it was called The Battle of the Five Armies, and it was very terrible.\" -J.R.R. Tolkien, \"The Hobbit\" The \"very terrible\" battle takes up only one chapter in Tolkien's novel and is the majority of the action in Peter Jackson's final entry in \"The Hobbit\" trilogy. It's a stunner of a sequence, although it also illuminates the flawed logic of stretching out Tolkien's book into three installments. What is the real story? How do we get from A to B? And, crucially, why do we care?\u00a0 Advertisement And where is Bilbo Baggins in all of it? The novel is concise, humorous, with a dark periphery, and even in the midst of extremely tense moments, we have Bilbo, a tut-tutting little homebody, wondering how the heck he got involved in all of this nonsense in the first place. There's not enough Bilbo in \"The Battle of the Five Armies.\" The story misses his presence. The film's first mildly humorous moment, a line reading from Martin Freeman, comes almost 40 minutes in, and it's refreshing, but it highlights the humorlessness of the rest. There are some wonderful sequences in \"Battle of the Five Armies\", and the attention to detail is breathtaking (each different space rendered with thrilling complexity), but the film feels more like a long drawn-out closing paragraph rather than (like \"The Desolation of Smaug\") a vibrant stand-alone piece of the story. \"The Battle of the Five Armies\" picks up where \"Desolation of Smaug\" left off: Smaug the dragon (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) has burst free into the air, and descends onto the helpless people of Laketown in a blitzkrieg of fire. Bard (Luke Evans) becomes the natural leader of the traumatized refugees, who straggle around dazed at the destruction of their homes. An endless line of devastated people trail up the dizzying slopes towards the Lonely Mountain, where they hope to receive compensation for all they have lost. Meanwhile, the Dwarf contingency, along with Bilbo, hole themselves up in the Mountain, protecting the treasure, most of the dwarves uneasy about the increasingly paranoid leadership of Thorin (Richard Armitage). Christopher Lee and Cate Blanchett return, briefly, for a psychedelic scene of mortal combat with the ring wraiths that doesn't seem to have much to do with anything (although it is clearly supposed to be important), and Gandalf (Ian McKellan) returns from imprisonment to the field of battle. Tauriel the elf (Evangeline Lilly) is not given much to do, except love a dwarf, a big no-no in her world. She speaks about love repeatedly, softly and wondrously, and every time she does the entire film deflates en masse. Romantic love has nothing to do with the story overall, and the love subplot feels so obligatory that it's practically condescending. Advertisement The real story is about greed, what Tolkien termed \"dragon-sickness,\" and when Jackson focuses on that aspect, \"Battle of the Five Armies\" finds its footing. It's a strong theme, Shakespearean in scope, perfectly exemplified in one nightmare sequence in which Thorin, lost to \"dragon-sickness,\" greedy and jumpy, finds himself sucked into a monstrous whirlpool of thick molten gold. Everyone who has read the book knows that Thorin loses it once he has the gold under his care, but Jackson imagined it in a way that is surreal and visceral. When the battle finally comes, it is tremendous. Armies swoop towards one another across a vast plain, each group displaying their own intricate maneuvers and battle strategies, wielding their own specific weaponry, making one think it could be a deleted scene from John Woo's \"Red Cliff,\" or that a fussy Middle Earth equivalent of John Keegan had been a consultant on the film, providing information on how the dwarf infantry worked, and how the elves moved in formation. The sequence is an enormous pantomime of carnage that somehow maintains its sense of spatial relations and emotional tension (there is a terrific standoff between Thorin and the head Orc on a sheet of ice near a treacherous frozen waterfall). Peter Jackson has devoted an enormous part of his life to the creation of these films, and taken all together they are a major accomplishment. \"The Hobbit\" may have been better served by being a single film: by forcing the action to be condensed into a single through-line, the storytelling would have more urgency, there would be less room for any \"fat\" on the story, there would be no detraction from its overall themes. The world-building aspect of the films is thrilling, and there are spaces created in all three of \"The Hobbit\" films that are unforgettable.\u00a0 Advertisement But that magic something is missing in \"Battle.\" There are glimpses of it, glimpses of true poignancy and emotion: the friendship between Thorin and Bilbo, Bilbo turning back to look at the row of dwarves standing in the doorway, the last conversation with Gandalf, and the final moment of the film. These moments are lovely; these moments are presented concisely, strongly and openly. There, there is the story. Tolkien understood the appeal of home, of a nice pipe and a cozy fire, of being surrounded by those who know you, where life is safe and your role is set. Bilbo Baggins is thrust out of his comfort zone, and must come up with the goods in extraordinary circumstances. Frodo had the same role in the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. These journeys are epic, and yet they are grounded in those homey details that make us understand and sympathize. Hobbits are constantly underestimated. They underestimate themselves. Tolkien's work taps into a great universal anxiety: would I be up to a similar task? How would I fare if I were called? Would I be brave? Or would I cave? At its best, Jackson's films dig into those questions. \"The Desolation of Smaug,\" part two in the trilogy, which this reviewer loved, is the strongest of the three films, because it never forgets that at the heart of it is a small creature who is overwhelmed by fear, and yet who must be brave anyway.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Megan Leavey", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Last year, four military dogs received medals for valor in the inaugural American Humane K-9 Medal of Courage Awards, with American Humane President Robin Ganzert saying at the ceremony on Capitol Hill, \"We feel it is time to recognize and honor the extraordinary feats and acts of devotion these heroic animals perform every day.\u201d Military dogs are valued for their noses, their ability to sniff out IEDs, weapons caches, other buried explosives, as well as their loyalty and high intelligence. There's a YouTube clip showing a soldier reuniting with his military dog, and as the soldier approaches the dog's cage, the dog starts howling with joy and excitement. She can smell him coming. Once the cage door opens, the dog\u2014a scrappy black Labrador\u2014circles endlessly around her former handler, not even stopping for pats or kisses. If the bond between human and dog is already intense, dogs being what they are, then the bond between a military dog handler and his or her canine partner is even more so. \"Megan Leavey,\" directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, tells the story of the profound bond between a Marine corporal and her war dog Rex.\u00a0 Advertisement Based on a true story, \"Megan Leavey\" is that rare breed: a war movie that actually shows something new about war, a sub-culture within a familiar sub-culture, the world of the military's K-9 units. For that alone, it should be applauded. Everyone should know how incredible these dogs are. But beyond its fascinating informational aspects, \"Megan Leavey\" is a powerfully emotional film that somehow\u2014unbelievably, considering the subject matter\u2014avoids sentimentality altogether. Kate Mara is Megan Leavey, seen at the outset of the film as an aimless young woman living in upstate New York, sleeping all day, fighting with her mother (Edie Falco), doing nothing with her life. One day, after seeing two Marines in their parade-ground finest walk into a recruiting center, she joins up. And before she can even catch her breath, she's in boot camp. The opening sequence of \"Megan Leavey,\" setting up Megan's life \"before\" is no longer than five minutes. Boot camp passes in a raging montage showing recruits climbing walls, doing pushups, being screamed at, etc. (The real-life Megan Leavey is one of those screaming drill sergeants.) The \"setup\" is not belabored. We get it in two or three shots. Cowperthwaite is an efficient director, and the script (by Pamela Gray, Annie Mumolo, Tim Lovestedt) is also a model of efficiency. In an industry where movies, in general, are too long, where every \"t\" is crossed to make sure we \"get it,\" such productivity is almost a miracle. We do get to know Megan over the course of the film, but we get to know her through her relationship with the dog she is assigned once she joins the Marine Corps' K-9 unit, a ferocious and difficult to handle German Shepherd named Rex. It is only in that relationship that Megan, like the Velveteen Rabbit, starts to \"become real.\" Why Megan is drawn to joining the K-9 Unit is\u2014like her reasoning for joining the Marines in the first place\u2014left unsaid. After misbehaving one night with a couple of other drunk recruits, she is assigned \"shit detail,\" literally it turns out, cleaning the dog cages. But she watches the handlers working with their dogs in the outdoor training area, and lobbies to get a position with the unit. The commanding officer is Gunny Martin, played by Common, who was so phenomenal just recently in \"John Wick: Chapter 2,\" and is great here as well. Megan pesters him enough that he finally gives her the go-ahead. And, of course, she is assigned the dog she fears the most, the dog that everyone fears the most: Rex. \"Megan Leavey,\" so good in its most important aspects, is especially good in these sequences showing the training processes for these soldiers and dogs. This is an aspect of military culture we have not seen before. The dogs know how to sniff out explosives, but the soldiers have to learn how to give commands, to praise, to guide, and\u2014if necessary\u2014to provide medical assistance to their injured canines. All of this requires intense bonding and mutual trust. As the K-9 trainer (Tom Felton) reminds Megan: \"Everything you feel goes down leash.\" Megan is not a particularly warm person, she doesn't make connections easily. The trainer says to her, \"I can't teach you how to bond.\" Advertisement The bonding happens through the doing. The deployment to Iraq that follows is a steep learning curve for both Megan and Rex. Ramon Rodriguez plays Matt Morales, another dog handler already on deployment, who shows Megan the ropes, giving her tips and warnings. There are bounties on their heads already, he tells her, even higher bounties for female canine handlers. There's some light-hearted joshing between Matt and Megan (she's a Yankees fan, he's a Mets fan, enough said), and they play cards late at night, their canine partners sleeping in the desert sand at their feet. Cowperthwaite's direction is specific and confident, especially in one extremely complex battle scene where\u2014unlike in a lot of films nowadays that over-rely on shaky-cams and quick-cuts\u2014you can tell what is happening, who is doing what, and why. But Cowperthwaite also understands that the way this material works is to present it in a straightforward manner. She trusts the material, trusts her lead actress to deliver the goods, and trusts us out here watching. Megan's story is well-known (it made the national news at the time), but even if you remember the details, the way it plays out\u2014and the increasing desperation of the PTSD-rattled Leavey to get what she wants and needs\u2014is heartrending to endure. The only criticism I really have is with the film's un-evocative title. Sometimes it's helpful to imagine the potential ways this film could have gone wrong in order to understand why it works so well. If Megan's \"problem with bonding\" had been over-stated, underlined, pathologized, etc., then her Velveteen-Rabbit transformation would not have the power that it does. There's a moment late in the film when she talks about Rex to a support group and she breaks down in tears. There is nothing \"performative\" about this scene, not in Mara's acting, and not in the way Cowperthwaite films it. Mara is in medium shot, for example, not a close-up. A close-up would telegraph, \"Here is the Big Catharsis. Cue strings.\" The emotion in \"Megan Leavey\" is not forced. It flows, up and down the leash, just like it's supposed to.

{"Title": "Get Out", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "This review was originally published on January 24, 2017, as a part of our Sundance Film Festival coverage. With the ambitious and challenging \u201cGet Out,\u201d which premiered in a secret screening at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, Jordan Peele reveals that we may someday consider directing the greatest talent of this fascinating actor and writer. We knew from his days on \u201cKey & Peele\u201d and in feature comedies that he was a multiple threat, but his directorial debut is a complex, accomplished genre hybrid that should alter his business card. \u201cGet Out\u201d feels fresh and sharp in a way that studio horror movies almost never do. It is both unsettling and hysterical, often in the same moment, and it is totally unafraid to call people on their racist bullshit. When he introduced the film in Park City, he revealed that it started with an attempt to write a movie he hadn\u2019t seen before. We need more directors willing to take risks with films like \"Get Out.\" Advertisement To be fair, Peele is clearly riffing on some films he has seen before, including \u201cThe Stepford Wives\u201d and \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby,\u201d although with a charged, racial twist. His film is essentially about that unsettling feeling when you know you don\u2019t belong somewhere; when you know you\u2019re unwanted or perhaps even wanted too much. Peele infuses the age-old genre foundation of knowing something is wrong behind the closed doors around you with a racial, satirical edge. What if going home to meet your girlfriend\u2019s white parents wasn\u2019t just uncomfortable but downright life-threatening? \u201cGet Out\u201d opens with a fantastic tone-setter. A young man (the great Keith Stanfield, in two other movies at this year\u2019s Sundance and fantastic on FX\u2019s \u201cAtlanta\u201d) is walking down a suburban street, joking with someone on the phone about how he always gets lost because all the streets sound the same. A car passes him, turns around, and slowly starts following him. It\u2019s an otherwise empty street, so the guy knows something is wrong. Suddenly, and perfectly staged in terms of Peele\u2019s direction, the intensity of the situation is amplified and we are thrust into a world in which the safe-looking suburbs are anything but.  Cut to our protagonists, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams of \u201cGirls\u201d), preparing to go home to meet her parents. Rose hasn\u2019t told them he\u2019s black, which she blows off as no big deal, but he\u2019s wary. His TSA Agent buddy (a hysterical LilRel Howery) warns him against going too, but Chris is falling in love with Rose. He\u2019ll have to meet them eventually. And Rose swears her dad would have voted for Obama a third time if he could have. From the minute that Chris and Rose arrive at her parents\u2019 house, something is unsettling. Sure, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener) seem friendly enough, but almost too much so, like they\u2019re looking to impress Chris. More unnerving is the demeanor of a groundskeeper named Walter (Marcus Henderson) and a housekeeper named Georgina (Betty Gabriel), who almost appear to be like the pod people from \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers.\u201d There\u2019s just something wrong. But, as we so often do in social or racial situations, Chris keeps trying to excuse their behavior\u2014maybe Walter is jealous and maybe Georgina has an issue with Chris being with a white woman. The lurking presence of Rose\u2019s odd brother (Caleb Landry Jones), who often looks like he\u2019s auditioning for a remake of \u201cA Clockwork Orange,\u201d doesn\u2019t help. Chris goes out to have a smoke one night, and, well, things start to get even stranger in ways I won\u2019t spoil\u2014in fact, the preview gives away way too much. Avoid it if you can. Advertisement \u201cGet Out\u201d is a slow-burn of a film for its first half as Peele piles up the clues that something is wrong. Or could Chris just be overreacting to everyday racial tension? Peele\u2019s greatest gift here is in the way he walks that fine line, staging exchanges that happen all the time but imbuing them with a greater degree of menace. As white partygoers comment on Chris\u2019 genetically-blessed physical gifts, the mind is racing as to what exactly the greater purpose of this visit is for this young man, a minority in a sea of white people who seem to want to own him, which is itself a razor-sharp commentary on the way we often seek to possess cultural aspects other than our own. Then Peele drops his hammer. The final act of \u201cGet Out\u201d is an unpredictable thrill ride. As a writer, Peele doesn\u2019t quite bring all of his elements together in the climax in the way I wish he would, but he proves to be a strong visual artist as a director, finding unique ways to tell a story that goes increasingly off the rails. The insanity of the final act allows some of the satirical, racially-charged issues to drop away, which is slightly disappointing. He\u2019s playing with so many interesting ideas when it comes to race that I wish the film felt a bit more satisfying in its payoff, even if that disappointment is amply offset by the pure intensity of the final scenes, during which Peele displays a skill with horror action that I didn\u2019t know he had.\u00a0 Peele works well with actors too, drawing a great leading man turn from Kaluuya, letting Williams essentially riff on her \u201cGirls\u201d persona, and knowing exactly what to do with Whitford & Keener, both of whom have always had that dangerous edge to their amiability. They\u2019re excellent at working something sinister into their gracious host routines. Most importantly, Peele knows how to keep his concept front and center. \u201cGet Out\u201d is not a film that takes breaks for comedy routines (even if Howery allows a little relief, it's often in the context of how he's convinced all white people want black sex slaves), keeping us on edge and uncertain from the opening scene to the final one. He understands that every time a black man goes home to visit his white girlfriend\u2019s parents, there is uncertainty and unease. He\u2019s merely turning that up, using an easily identifiable racial tension to make a horror movie. Many of our greatest genre filmmakers have done exactly the same thing\u2014amplifying fears already embedded in the human condition for the purpose of movie horror. We just don\u2019t often see something quite so ambitious from a February horror flick or a first-time director. Even if the second half doesn\u2019t quite fulfill the promise of the first, Peele doesn\u2019t just deserve credit for trying something so daring; he should have producers knocking down his door to see what else he\u2019s never seen before.

{"Title": "White Girl", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Leah (\"Homeland\"'s Morgan Saylor) is not a \"girl\u00a0gone wild.\" She's already wild when \"White Girl\" starts, a first feature from writer/director Elizabeth Wood, and apparently loosely based on some of Wood's experiences while she was in college in New York. \"White Girl\" is the story of the couple of weeks in Leah's life before her sophomore year where she gets involved with Blue (Brian Marc), the Latino drug dealer who hangs out on the corner beneath her apartment window. Blue is busted for possession, and Leah\u2014out of nowhere\u2014begins a frenzied quest to move mountains (of coke, literally) to get him out of jail. She's only known him for five days or so when he gets busted, so her maniacal devotion to him makes little sense, since she also barely seems to perceive him outside of the drugs he provides. Wood's style is immersive and raw, although to what end is not clear. The characters are envelope-thin (except for Blue). Leah is a cipher, made up only of impulsive addict behavior. Maybe addicts are just their addiction, but it makes for somewhat dreary viewing when the lead character has no apparent personality. The scenes of wretched debauchery pile up, and in a film only 88 minutes long it's a tough slog. It's difficult to perceive what story is actually being told. There's a lot to look at, colors, light, drugs and nudity, and much of it looks really good. But there's nothing else to latch onto. Advertisement Leah has dyed her long straggly hair platinum-white, and her vampirish pale skin,\u00a0white\u00a0tank tops and tiny\u00a0white\u00a0sundresses make her look like a deranged wraith, floating through the about-to-be-gentrified streets of Ridgewood, Queens. She's always either plastered or blasted out by a hangover the next morning. Leah is the \"white girl\" of the title (although there's a \"brand\" of cocaine mentioned that has the same name). Leah is not an innocent naif who wanders into the underworld of Needle Park. She's a college student with a summer internship at a \"hip\" magazine, where her reprehensible boss (Justin Bartha) offers her coke (which she promptly snorts up), and then proceeds to screw her in his office. Hooking up with Blue\u00a0is part of her quest for drugs and excitement, a jagged break with her suburban privileged past. Leah is an addict (\"I'd drink nail polish remover if someone gave it to me,\" she says) and far more hardcore in her drug use than any of her drug dealer friends, who smoke weed but don't touch the hard stuff they sell. Her relationship with Blue starts out with stand-up sex on her rooftop, but Blue treats her with an almost formal and gentlemanly protection. He sees her as a sweet\u00a0girl\u00a0playing around with danger, and he's worried she will get in over her head. He's a transparent kid, with an open face, a quick and sincere smile, and he bonds himself to her pretty quickly. He is capable of intimacy. She is not. There is so much explicit sex in \"White Girl\" that you wonder how anyone has time to do anything else, but Blue feels something for her. He graces her with a nickname (\"Shorty\"), and wants to take her out for a nice dinner, Italian or something. Their relationship is the most intriguing part of the film, and that is due entirely to Brian Marc, a hugely gifted young actor. Saylor has a tendency (evident in \"Homeland,\" too) to \"indicate\" her emotional progression, one beat at a time. It makes for a stilted end result, and lots of unnecessary pauses as she walks us through that progression. Marc, on the other hand, has figured out for himself as an actor why his character would fall in love with Leah, what it is he senses in her, what he envisions in a life with her. When he says to her later with tears in his eyes, \"How could I fuck up right when I met you?\", you believe him. You can't take your eyes off of him. Chris Noth shows up as a beleaguered lawyer, known for defending drug dealers, who's willing to help out the\u00a0girl\u00a0with the long\u00a0white\u00a0hair who begs him to get her \"friend\" out of jail. He looks at Leah and clocks immediately what she is all about. He says to her, \"It's a fucked-up system,\" noting the difference between what happens when a person of color is busted and a\u00a0white\u00a0person is busted. He does his best to combat that unfairness, and his office piled with case files looks like a hoarder's paradise. Advertisement There are numerous nods to Larry Clark's 1995 film \"Kids,\" in particular a scene between Leah and the lawyer, but mostly because of its portrayal of an urban environment as a pitiless wilderness where privileged unmonitored kids fall through the cracks. There are no true grownups in \"White Girl,\" although Blue is clearly a good man with, ironically, the only moral compass in the entire five boroughs.\u00a0 What is the point, ultimately, of all of this? A personal catharsis for the director, maybe, which would explain her seeming lack of awareness that Leah does not come across as a person with recognizable motives, or an inner life outside of her immediate circumstances. There's a voyeuristic aspect to the film: the nudity, the constant sex, the scene where Leah snorts a line of coke off of someone's penis in a nightclub bathroom. Maybe this is an actual snapshot of the various cultures that meet up in New York. Drugs bring all the classes together. If Leah was more than her mane of tangled\u00a0white\u00a0hair, the story\u2014whatever it is supposed to be\u2014would reveal itself. Here, the story is only in Blue's face. Unfortunately, that's not enough.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Dark Was the Night", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "This movie opens at a logging camp, a setting little seen in\r\ncontemporary cinema. Trees getting cut, woods getting shredded, in a\r\nformidable forest framed by intimidating grey sky. It\u2019s the end of the work\r\nday, and the men are supposed to be coming in, but a supervisor talks into his\r\nwalkie talkie; he\u2019s not getting an answer from some workers, and he\u2019s annoyed.\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t hesitate to lock you guys in for the weekend,\u201d he says, and he gets no\r\nanswer, so he goes deeper in to the woods to investigate. Advertisement What he sees is not pleasant, and he\u2019s not going to be able\r\nto share his subsequent experience with anybody. \u201cDark Was The Night\u201d is a\r\nhorror movie, a creepy and atmospheric and sometimes blood-soaked horror movie,\r\nand it\u2019s got a good amount going for it. Even though it does split from the\r\nnovel logging-camp setting to something a little more generic, the small town\r\nof Maiden Woods, 90 miles south from the opening unpleasantness. Here, too, it\u2019s\r\npretty grey, and folks aren\u2019t exactly perky. The town sheriff Paul Shields\r\n(Kevin Durand) and his new deputy Donny Saunders (Lucas Haas), considered a\r\nnovelty on account of his hailing from New York City (the picture was shot\r\nupstate) have their attention called to some unusual happenings\u2014a cranky stable\r\nman\u2019s missing horse most prominently\u2014and eventually see a pattern forming. A\r\npattern that suggests something otherworldly that\u2019s doing a lot of killing.  Director Jack Heller shows a firm grasp of horror movie\r\nmechanics, laying on the shocks and the atmosphere with assurance and vitality.\r\nScreenwriter Tyler Hisel\u2019s storyline, though, shows an equally firm grasp of\r\nsome genre conventions that are a bit tired. Shields is estranged from his wife\r\nSusan (Bianca Kajlich), seeming to share custody of their young son and quietly\r\nrefusing Susan\u2019s offer to seek counseling with him. It turns out that their problems\r\nstem from the loss of another child (seen in family photographs wearing a red\r\nslicker that brings to mind \u201cDon\u2019t Look Now\u201d) that Shields couldn\u2019t prevent.\r\nThis sets up a whole super-obvious\r\nself-blaming-taciturn-father-figure-finds-shot-at-redemption scenario. Donny\u2019s\r\ngot his skeletons too. This is less tiresome than it might be on account of the\r\nsparse dialogue and the excellent acting from Durand and Haas, but it gave me\r\nsome qualms that I\u2019d sooner not have experienced early on in the picture. \"Dark Was the Night\" does, deliberately, build to a tense and\r\nsometimes jump-from-your-seat scary climax which finds most of the small town\u2019s\r\nresidents holed up in the local church, trying to nail down what has by this\r\ntime been pretty firmly established as a bonafide monster stalking the local\r\nwoods. And the quest is, it turns out, made more engaging by the guilt and\r\nself-doubt experienced by its main characters. As for the creature itself, it\r\ncould have been pretty ridiculous, but a combination of smart effects design (I\r\nbelieve Danny Shinwoong Kang is the responsible effects person) and cinematic\r\ndiscretion make\u00a0the damn thing work.

{"Title": "Draft Day", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The first round of the 2013 NFL Draft on ESPN was watched by\r\nmore than 6 million people. It\u2019s an amazing number when one considers\r\nthe history of a process in which winners and losers won't be defined for years to come. These are viewers, most of them diehard fans, engaged\r\nin a prospect, a dream, a chance for a better future for their team. Will their\r\nfirst-round pick be Andrew Luck or Ryan Leaf? Every decision is analyzed to the\r\npoint of exhaustion as the popularity of the NFL is rarely more pronounced than\r\nin the fact that people are more interested in players who might hit the field\r\nin four months than those actually playing hockey, basketball, and baseball that\r\nvery day. And it creates a pressure cooker atmosphere for those actually tasked\r\nwith trying to separate the Leafs from the Lucks. Rabid fans make for tense\r\nexecutives. When Donovan McNabb was drafted over Texas phenom Ricky Williams in\r\nthe 1999 draft, Philadelphia almost collectively lost its mind. Make a mistake\r\nat the draft and you might not be around as long as the player you just picked.\r\n Advertisement The \u201cWar Room\u201d environment of decision-making on the day of\r\nthe NFL draft was too enticing for Hollywood to avoid for long, and so the\r\nstar-studded and cameo-heavy \u201cDraft Day\u201d arrives to offer viewers a behind-the-scenes\r\nlook at how an NFL team can be broken or salvaged with just a series of\r\nnegotiations and player assessments. Both too \u201cinside baseball\u201d for non-NFL\r\nfans to care and not nearly character-driven enough at the same time, Ivan\r\nReitman\u2019s film is cluttered, noisy, and often nonsensical. Reitman lacks\r\nconfidence in the script by Rajiv Joseph & Scott Rothman (and probably\r\nshould) and so he uses more split-screen than an episode of \u201c24\u201d in an attempt\r\nto make a flat story pop.  Sonny Weaver, Jr. (Kevin Costner) is having the kind of\r\nstressful month that only happens in the movies. He\u2019s the general manager of\r\nthe long-suffering Cleveland Browns, and has to choose between a hothead linebacker\r\nnamed Vontae Mack (Chadwick Boseman) and a troubled running back named Ray\r\nJennings (Houston Texans star Arian Foster) with the team\u2019s #7 pick. Sonny\u2019s\r\nnamesake was the beloved coach of the Browns for years and just passed away in\r\nthe last week. Because grief over his father\u2019s passing, job tension, and the\r\ndraft pick weren\u2019t enough for the screenwriters, the film opens with the\r\nrevelation that Sonny\u2019s girlfriend Ali (Jennifer Garner) happens to be\r\npregnant. Of course, Ali works with Sonny and their romance has been\r\n(relatively) secret. Not enough movie for you? Sonny\u2019s day becomes significantly more\r\nintense when the Seattle Seahawks call and offer to trade down their #1 pick to\r\nthe Browns. Weaver knows he needs to make a splash (and is literally told as\r\nmuch in a horrendously-scripted scene with his boss, Frank Langella\u2019s Anthony\r\nMolina) and so he chooses to trade his future for his present, giving the next\r\nthree first-round picks to Seattle for the chance to draft Wisconsin superstar\r\nBo Callahan (Josh Pence). His coach (Denis Leary) loses his mind and Sonny\r\nspends the rest of the day trying to figure out how to turn his draft around\u2026and\r\nhis life, of course. Advertisement \u201cDraft Day\u201d is well-cast. Costner has the world-weariness of a man losing sleep over college kids and job security. Langella and Leary\r\nknow how to push the right buttons when it comes to turning up the heat on our\r\nprotagonist. Supporting roles feel well-considered, including scene-stealers\r\nlike W. Earl Brown, Terry Crews, Sam Elliott, and Ellen Burstyn. And yet all of these interesting performers can't save a dull script. To work, \u201cDraft Day\u201d needs the kind of witty dialogue and\r\nsnappy energy that Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin brought to \u201cMoneyball\u201d but the screenwriters mistake constant activity for actual screenwriting.\r\nEveryone serves a plot purpose in this cluttered tale instead of playing an\r\nactual person: \"the girlfriend,\" \"the coach,\" \"the mom,\" \"the agent,\" \"the owner,\" and so on.\r\nThey are archetypes and often fail to feel realistic even in that regard. Langella\u2019s Art Modell\r\nriff (it\u2019s no coincidence he has the same initials as the legendary Browns\r\nowner who moved the team to Baltimore in the \u201890s) is a caricature, Burstyn\r\npops up just to manipulatively tug at heartstrings, and the romance between\r\nCostner & Garner contains zero chemistry. As if he could tell that he had a shallow script, Reitman does\r\nhis best to make it all seem more interesting than it is with visual tricks.\r\nCharacters cross split screens, creating a truly odd aesthetic in which it looks\r\nlike people in separate cities are sharing the same space while talking on the\r\nphone. The on-screen ticking clock counting down to the\r\ndraft, the pomp and circumstance of NFL logos every time a new team comes into\r\nthe narrative; these are the kind of filmmaking tricks that might have enhanced\r\na quality script but feel like a lot of window-dressing with this one. In\r\nessence, it\u2019s not dissimilar to what ESPN does with the actual draft, pumping\r\nit up with fanfare, high-tech graphics, and on-screen stats to give the viewer\r\nthe impression they\u2019re watching something truly important.  What \u201cDraft Day\u201d\r\nmisses is that the reason 6 million people watch the actual draft is because it\u2019s\r\nmerely the prelude to the story of their team and possibly their new favorite\r\nplayer, and not the whole story in itself. We buy into the dream because of what it could mean for our sports\r\nfandom. The movie about this phenomenon clutters that hope with too many characters\r\ninvolved in uninteresting (and often unbelievable) subplots, dragging the high\r\nthat true sports fans feel on draft day to the ground.

{"Title": "Colossal", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "What if Godzilla was a projection of your issues? That's the question posed by \"Colossal,\" a new film by Nacho Vigalondo in which an alcoholic screwup named Gloria (Anne Hathaway) unleashes terror on Seoul, South Korea, in the form of a giant monster by getting blackout-drunk.  This sounds like the premise of a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch blown up to feature length, but part of the weird charm of \"Colossal\" is its willingness to be that kind of movie to the Nth degree. It warmly embraces the central idea and explores it in detail, without burdening it with gravity that it can't support. Vigalondo, who has carved out a niche making wry, small-scaled, rather peculiar genre films, doesn't do that. This movie feels as if somebody woke from an intense nightmare, decoded it and realized it was rather unsubtly working through some of their unresolved problems, then brought it to Judd Apatow and said, \"Here's your next comedy.\"\u00a0  Advertisement The story starts in New York City. Gloria's boyfriend (Dan Stevens) breaks up with her after she spends all night out with reprobate friends without notifying him. Dan breaks up with her and kicks her out. There will be no second chances this time: he already packed a suitcase for her. Gloria returns to her hometown in upstate New York, moves into the home that her parents vacated when they moved south after their retirement, and runs into a childhood friend named Oscar (Jason Sudeikis), who owns a local bar, a perfect place to get a job if you're an alcoholic who doesn't have two nickels to rub together. After a long night drinking at the bar with Oscar and his friends Joel (Austin Stowell) and Garth (Tim Blake Nelson), she stumbles home and wakes up to hear that a gigantic creature has attacked Seoul. \"Colossal\" doesn't send Gloria on a time-wasting journey to figure out if there's any connection between her issues and the creature's rampage; instead, it spends its energy asking what such a discovery might mean to Gloria personally and how it relates to her train wreck of a personal life. I should pause here and allow that to enjoy this film, you have to accept that it unfolds in a space somewhere between dream/allegory and realistic psychological comedy and that it's never going to treat the rampage as anything other than a representation of Gloria's problems. Imagine a relatively laid back, small-scaled indie comedy about a woman coming to terms with the mess she's made of her life, but with her demons represented by a kaiju that looks like something out of an older \"Godzilla\" movie.  Part of the film's unique sense of humor comes from the way it plays against our expectation that\u00a0Vigalondo\u00a0is going to make things bigger at some point. He never does. The film takes the characters' problems seriously, but it never becomes self-important. There is property damage and a body count on the other side of the world, and this gives Gloria an urgent reason to convince her friends that what she believes is happening is, in fact, happening, and take a long look at herself and urge her fellow barflies, who aren't exactly temperate individuals, to do the same. Advertisement Hathaway is quite appealing here, striking the right note between desperation and \"whatever, dude\" haplessness. Her performance has a Diane Keaton-ish quality. Vigalondo's screenplay and her acting do a terrific job of shaping Gloria as the kind of person you may have known, or perhaps been, at some point. She's clever enough and good looking enough to get other people, particularly men, to forgive her tendency to make messes and take advantage, but only up to a point. She's a user of both intoxicants and other people, and she knows it. She also knows that unless she gets a handle on things, she going to keep re-enacting the same cycle until she's either dead or an old lady who lives in a tiny rented bedroom somewhere and spends most of her monthly Social Security check on booze.  My only major complaint\u2014and I'm not sure it's even a valid one,  considering that \"Colossal\" never seems that interested in addressing  it\u2014is that the movie has a political and racial dimension that it  doesn't really explore because it's so focused on Gloria and her pals:  it's a movie about comfortable Americans who project their personal turmoil on another culture without giving their wanton  destructiveness a second thought. There's a more multilayered and rich genre film somewhere in that notion, and I can imagine a filmmaker like Guillermo del Toro (\"Pan's Labyrinth\") or George Romero (\"Dawn of the Dead\") or John Carpenter (\"They Live\") dealing with it directly. My only minor complaint is that, even though it's short, it still feels a bit slight, its evident modesty notwithstanding.  But just when you think you've gotten everything that the premise can give you, \"Colossal\" takes things in a slightly different direction than you expected. I don't want to say much more about the rest of the plot, because it takes surprising turns. I'll just say that the cast is quietly superb, that the movie always knows what it is and what it wants to say. If you go into \"Colossal\" expecting another \"Pacific Rim\" or \"Kong: Skull Island,\" you will emerge less than two hours later puzzled or perhaps angry at what you just saw. Everybody has issues. Maybe we should be grateful that they don't have giant footprints.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Machete Kills", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Like most of Robert Rodriguez's movies, \"Machete Kills\" is a self-aware exploitation picture that winks as it picks your pocket.  Written by Kyle Ward from a story by the director and his brother Marcel, \"Machete Kills\" returns our craggy hero (Danny Trejo) to hard-\"R\" action. The tale starts as an international revenge mission, then morphs into a Southwestern-fried spoof of a James Bond film, with Machete foiling a \"Moonraker\"-type plot by a crazed tycoon (Mel Gibson, spoofing his real-life image as a rich bully).  Advertisement The picture is assembled with energy and a smidgen of style, but it's tiresome and slight. Rodriguez, who also edits, shoots and scores his movies, tries to do too much with too little here. The lighting, editing and special effects are a couple of notches up from a SyFy shark movie. Rodriguez is canny about acknowledging the picture's fast-and-cheap aesthetic; the weak green-screen effects and CGI blood-spurts are presented as a shared joke between you and the movie. Still, after a certain point viewers who paid twelve to fifteen bucks might wish that all the winking and shrugging were accompanied by more cleverness, and a sense of when to quit. At 107 minutes, \"Machete Kills\" is way too much of a pretty good thing.  But you could say the original \"Machete\" was way too much of a pretty good thing, too, and none of this constitutes a news flash. Rodriguez's 1992 breakthrough \"El Mariachi,\" which he financed partly by renting his body in medical tests, was a rare example of a calling card that told you exactly what the caller intended to sell\u2014not just then, but for the rest of his life. Rodriguez's brand of hucksterism has quotation marks around it, but he's still one of the few truly committed \"B\"-moviemakers of the modern era. His Austin-based Troublemaker Studios has turned into the Troma Films or American International Pictures of the American Southwest. Rodriguez presides over it as a director-showman, an entrepreneur who prides himself on seeing how far he can stretch a buck, or a concept. (In the time it took to read this paragraph, he probably directed another movie.) The \"Machete\" franchise started life as a fake trailer in Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino's 2007 \"Grindhouse\" project. Like\u00a0some of the 1970s redneck potboilers and blaxploitation flicks it channeled, the first movie was more fun to remember than it was to watch, but it did well enough to prompt Rodriguez to devise two follow-ups, modeled on the original \"Star Wars\" sequels. This picture is littered with imagery and situations borrowed from George Lucas' 1970s dreamscapes, including lightsabers (lightmachetes?), a car that looks like land-speeder, and a deep-voiced baddie in a mask. This middle chapter is the \"Empire\" of the \"Machete\" cycle, complete with downer ending. If Machete's world were rich enough to merit even one feature film, Rodriguez's audacity would amaze. Too bad Machete don't franchise. Advertisement At least the picture has the courage of its silly convictions, pushing the original's spoofy humor to \"Blazing Saddles\" levels. Machete gets hanged, beaten, shot, blown up, and eaten alive by wolverines\u2014okay, I made up the wolverine thing, but you would have believed it, right?\u2014and yet he still has the energy to do the boom-chicka-wow-wow with a busty secret agent posing as Miss San Antonio (Amber Heard), banter with the one-eyed badass Sh\u00e9 (Michelle Rodriguez, channeling Snake Plissken again), kill a dozen tough guys with whatever weapons are handy, and ride a missile into orbit, in what you might call a \"Reverse Kong.\" Even when the director is bludgeoning us with digital gore and half-baked innuendo, he maintains a light touch. As the Mexican revolutionary that Machete is hired to find and extricate, Demian Bichir gives an appealing screw-loose performance, arching his eyebrows like Bruce Campbell in \"Evil Dead\" mode and exploding in bug-eyed fury. Lady Gaga, Walton Goggins, Antonio Banderas and Cuba Gooding Jr., all play an assassin named La Camale\u00f3n, and their performances are surprisingly consistent. \"Modern Family\" star\u00a0Sof\u00eda Vergara plays a whorehouse madam and hired gun who mows down enemies with a bullet-spitting bra; freed from the burden of sitcom lovability, she chews through scenery as if auditioning for the role of Ms. Pac Man.\u00a0 Charlie Sheen, billed here as Carlos Estevez (his birth name), outdoes even Gibson in the self-mocking sleaze department, playing a U.S. president who promises to expunge Machete's criminal record if he completes his mission. \"My fellow Americans,\" the chief executive leers in a re-election ad, \"it's been a groovy four years, but those were only the beginning.\" When somebody calls him in the White House on his bedside phone, an anonymous babe picks up the receiver and passes it to another babe. I hoped the camera would keep panning, revealing a third babe, then a fourth, and that when we finally saw the president, he'd be wearing flannel pajamas and a nightcap and spooning with Bob Newhart.  Advertisement The best thing about this series is how it treats Machete's adventures as an \"R\"-rated folktale or bedtime story, as if he were the 21st century Mexican answer to John Henry or Paul Bunyan. \u00a0Rodriguez has a political streak that would be intriguing if it were backed up by more care and craft.\u00a0A rudely funny subplot finds day laborers being mysteriously abducted \u00e0 la \"Close Encounters\"; the punchline is that, like most Yankees, Gibson's bad guy can't anything done without Mexicans. Machete is a Mexican's Mexican, a man of the people. He distrusts Yankee law enforcement, federales, drug cartel members, American soldiers, the White House, and anyone else who tries to obstruct, reform or use him. He's constantly escaping powerful enemies by going figuratively or literally underground, like an undocumented worker hiding in plain sight. \"You know Mexico,\" the president tells the hero. \"Hell, you are Mexico.\"\u00a0 But all things considered, I'd still rather watch Danny Trejo sum up the plot of \"Machete Kills\" on a talk show than sit through this slapped-together movie again. I didn't laugh as hard at any of the film's jokes as I laughed at my friend Josh asking, \"Based solely on the title, I presume he has an amazing stand-up set at Caroline's?\"", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "My Name Is Emily", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Watching a film, or I should say successfully watching a film, usually requires a willed suspension of disbelief. I\u2019d say the same thing goes for making a film. In spite of technology that assists creative artists in getting more technically credible results with less work and for less money than in the past, making a film is still such an illogical process that successfully completing one requires a faith that passeth understanding.  \u201cMy Name Is Emily\u201d is in many respects an average and in several respects a kind of clich\u00e9d and frayed coming-of-age movie. The protagonist, Emily, kicks off the film by speaking to the audience, relating her quirky childhood as the only child of an eccentric academic who becomes a best-selling author and a mother who dies too soon. She repeats apercus from her dad along the lines of \u201cIf you hide from death, you hide from life\u201d and contributes cranky questions of her own to the narration like \u201cWhy do we smile in photographs?\u201d  Advertisement The best thing about Emily is that she\u2019s played by Evanna Lynch. Lynch, who played the charmingly abstracted Luna Lovegood in some of the Harry Potter pictures, has grown into a young woman who looks like a rougher-edged Saoirse Ronan, and she brings a gritty conviction to the antisocial tendencies that Emily cultivates after her beloved dad, played by Michael Smiley, is carted off to a lunatic asylum. Now with foster parents, she immediately alienates her new schoolteacher with a biographical approach to literary criticism, disclosing to her classmates that all that talk in Wordsworth about \u201csplendor in the grass\u201d is about sublimated sexual transgression and guilt. This and more put stars in the eyes of her handsome, upper-crust classmate Arden (George Webster). Emily couldn\u2019t be less interested. But then she does not receive her customary birthday card from dad, and Emily is forced to solicit her only potential friend on a mission to drive to the institution and confront the old man, and maybe even break him out of the joint. She calls on Arden at home just as he\u2019s getting a snootful from his awful dad, and before Arden can even say to dad \u201cNext time you hit me, you better knock me out,\u201d you\u2019re thinking \u201cRoad Trip!\u201d And off they go, abetted by a kindly grandma and her vintage auto (and its attendant eight-track player, and John Dankworth tape, even). Their exchanges, given Emily\u2019s emotional blockage, are predictably prickly. \u201cYou make me feel stupid,\u201d Arden helplessly protests to Emily at one point. \u201cSorry \u2026 \u201d Emily responds, \u201cthat\u2019s the nicest thing anyone\u2019s said to me.\u201d I guess the point where I lost patience with the movie was when the duo finally made it to the asylum, and Arden decided to distract the inmates by doing an amateur pyrotechnics show on the roof of the drab facility. Your mileage may vary.  What all this has to do with my ruminations at the beginning of the review is this: \u201cMy Name Is Emily\u201d was made under more-arduous-than-usual filmmaking circumstances. Its writer/director, Simon Fitzmaurice, is afflicted with motor neuron disease, a condition similar to ALS, which is famously suffered by physicist Stephen Hawking. Mr. Fitzmaurice is confined to a wheelchair and can write and communicate with the assistance of a computer that he interacts with via the movement of his eyes. So, for him to have completed this feature, almost a decade after a diagnosis that at the time had him living for only another four years, makes \u201cMy Name Is Emily\u201d a miracle in a way that most other movies aren\u2019t, even if you allow that all successfully completed movies are some kinds of miracles. It also means that if you\u2019re a human being you have a rooting interest in Mr. Fitzmaurice.\u00a0 Advertisement What\u2019s the line between \u201cI wish I liked this movie better?\u201d and \u201cI wish this movie was better?\u201d That\u2019s a knotty question. I will say that one aspect of this film for which I have unqualified enthusiasm is the way Mr. Fitzmaurice and his cinematographer Seamus Deasy shoot the various Irish locations, and how they place the characters therein; the effect is often beautifully picturesque without being in the least bit touristy. The sense of place is so palpable you can almost feel the raw wind going through the characters\u2019 hair in the seaside-set scenes. It represents the movie\u2019s most seductive achievement.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Irreplaceable You", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "When Abbie, who thinks she is pregnant due to the bloating in her belly, instead gets a diagnosis of Stage 4 cancer, her reaction is stunned shock, followed by a quip to her fiance, \"At least we won't have to pay for college.\" He replies, \"Unless it's a really smart tumor.\" There's a pause and he murmurs, \"Too soon.\" \"Irreplaceable You,\" written by actress Bess Wohl and directed by Stephanie Laing, is filled with dialogue like that, self-conscious \"quips\" meant to be witty gallows' humor, an adorable spin on denial. Grief does not look a certain way (and the expectation it should does a lot of damage to those going through it), but the language here is off-putting, skipping off a too-beautiful and insistently color-corrected surface. The dialogue creates an arch and artificial mood, never sounding like real talk despite the clearly talented actors (Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Michiel Huisman) playing the roles. The film itself seems to be in denial about its own story. Advertisement The \"adorable\" quality starts early when it shows how Abbie and Sam met. They were eight years old on a field trip to an aquarium, and when the tour guide describes how the monogamous deep-sea angler fish bites its chosen mate, young Abbie leans over and bites Sam. They have been together ever since in an uninterrupted continuum of monogamous coupledom. Her cancer diagnosis is the first event to tarnish their eternal intimacy. Adding to the sense of unreality, the couple live in a gigantic sun-drenched loft in New York, which looks interior-decorated by a professional. Abbie doesn't know how to cook a chicken. They eat takeout. Why, then, do they have an industrial sized kitchen, the walls lined with professional-grade cookware? (The tendency to put New York film characters into completely unrealistic apartments is so common as to be mundane, and when a film accepts the space challenges most New Yorkers live with\u2014even New Yorkers with good jobs\u2014it's such a welcome breath of reality.) \"Irreplaceable You\" gives cancer the most glamorous backdrop possible. Abbie's reaction to her diagnosis is to search for a new mate for Sam, someone who can take care of him when she's gone, who can make sure he doesn't wear mismatched socks. She creates an online profile for him and interviews potential candidates. She never seems sick, despite the seriousness of her diagnosis. She throws up from her treatment once. She's not exhausted or in pain. Nothing changes in her physically. Maybe it\u2019s unreasonable to be annoyed by this, but if you\u2019ve experienced the death of a loved one from cancer, you know how bad it can get, how extreme the challenges can be. In \u201cIrreplaceable You\u201d, cancer is used mostly as a plot point to get the story started. Abbie\u2019s cancer diagnosis is implicit as opposed to explicit, and there is no sense over the course of the film\u2014with one or two exceptions\u2014that the cancer is having any effect on her at all. This is a huge missed opportunity. The cancer support group Abbie attends is filled with characters played by heavy-hitting actors, many of whom far surpass both Abbie and Sam in interest. These scenes generate real sparks. There's Steve Coogan, as the group leader, who insists the crocheting he makes them do is \"not a metaphor.\" Kate McKinnon plays a woman in such denial about her diagnosis she insists, with bright manic eyes, that she's \"blessed.\u201d Her positive attitude drives everyone crazy. She vibrates with a tragic intensity missing from the rest of the film. Christopher Walken plays Myron, a man with a terminal diagnosis, who befriends Abbie. They spend time together. Their friendship is a huge aspect of the film. Myron is mainly there to be a sounding board for Abbie's \"project\" to marry Sam off. He thinks she's insane and tells her she is displaying signs of \"anticipatory grief,\" an insightful comment. Advertisement There are some good scenes between Abbie and her mother (the wonderful Tamara Tunie), where Abbie pushes her mother away, resenting the worried interference. There are some good scenes between Myron and Abbie, especially when Myron opens up about his own marriage. Walken's line readings are so his own the language takes wing for the first time. \"Ugly. Purple. Couch,\" he says. \"My wife put it in the living room and I was angry for two years.\" He brings with him the world-weary gravitas of a man who has seen it all, who still enjoys the simple things, who will miss his wife (Jacki Weaver), will even miss the ugly. purple. couch. In an episode of the television series \"thirtysomething,\" during the arc where Nancy (Patricia Wettig) develops cancer, Nancy spends more time with a new friend from her support group than she does with her family. This causes extreme tension with her husband who wants to soak up as much time with her as possible. But the people in Nancy's support group are the only ones who understand\u2014and are not afraid of\u2014what she is going through. These kinds of in-depth, difficult explorations are beyond \"Irreplaceable You\"'s capabilities. There's real poignancy in Myron's character and in Kate McKinnon's character. Abbie's journey\u2014from denial to acceptance\u2014is important, but it's wrapped up in a package that wants to be charming, wants\u00a0to be inspirational from the first frame with its posthumous voiceover and swelling music. I'm being hard on the film. It is not without its charms. But \"Irreplaceable You\" pays a price for prioritizing charm. The emotional process of accepting death\u2014for those suffering and for those who will be left behind\u2014is exacerbated by changes in the body, the impossibility of pain management, the medical bills, the sense survivors have of their loved one moving far away, even before death, into a realm where no one else can follow, the tide going out slowly, excruciatingly. Even though \"Irreplaceable You\" tries to avoid this reality, it shows up anyway. It's there in Kate McKinnon's desperate gleam of gaiety, in Christopher Walken's exhausted acceptance, in Tamara Tunie's sadness hidden behind a chipper competent surface. These all feel like emissaries from the real world. Too bad the main narrative doesn't take place in the real world at all. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Spotlight", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "On January 6, 2002, Boston Globe subscribers picked up their local paper and saw the front page headline: \"Church Allowed Abuse by Priest for Years.\" The story, written by Michael Rezendes, a reporter on the investigative \"Spotlight\" team, was massive, in word-count and impact, but it was just the beginning. Two more Spotlight stories on the same topic ran that day, with more to follow. The uproar from the Spotlight stories (The Boston Phoenix, an alternative weekly, had covered\u00a0church sexual abuse but it\u00a0didn't have the circulation of the Globe) was so sustained that by December 2002, Cardinal Bernard Law, the Archbishop of Boston, stepped down in disgrace, saying in a statement, \"To all those who have suffered from my shortcomings and mistakes I both apologize and from them beg forgiveness.\" (Pope John Paul II gave him a position in Rome, where Law remains to this day.) The Spotlight team won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for their reporting. These events are familiar to everyone by now, but those first Spotlight stories are painfully familiar to Boston Catholics (my family is Boston Irish-Catholic), and it was the first news story to dominate everyone's conversations since September 11th only a few months prior.\u00a0 Advertisement Tom McCarthy's superb \"Spotlight,\" co-written by McCarthy and Josh Singer, is the story of that investigation. \"Spotlight\" is a great newspaper movie of the old-school model, calling up not only obvious comparisons with \"All the President's Men\" and \"Zodiac,\" two movies with similar devotion to the sometimes crushingly boring gumshoe part of reportage, but also Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell shouting into adjacent phones in \"His Girl Friday.\" At a late moment in \"Spotlight,\" there's an image of the presses printing off the edition that carries the church abuse story. Such a scene is so de rigueur\u00a0in newspaper movies that it borders on cliche, but in \"Spotlight\" it is a moment of intense emotion. The truth in that edition, the evil it describes, will be a wound in the psyche of millions, but it\u00a0must come out.\u00a0 The Spotlight team is editor Walter \"Robby\" Robinson (Michael Keaton), and three reporters, Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matty Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). John Slattery plays Globe managing deputy editor Ben Bradlee Jr.. All of the reporters are locals, and everyone has some connection to the Catholic Church (referred to as only \"The Church\"). When a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), comes on board, he is perceived as an outsider because he's not from Boston at all (he is first seen boning up on the city by devouring \"The Curse of the Bambino.\") In an initial meeting with Robby, Baron brings up a recent piece by a Globe columnist about the Boston archdiocese's potentially shady handling of various abuse cases. Baron suggests the story could be perfect for the Spotlight team. Robby hesitates, but Baron gently pushes: \"This strikes me as an essential story for a local paper.\" It's a great line, and it's so underplayed by Schreiber that you might miss its effectiveness.\u00a0This goes for his entire performance. Right before the church-abuse edition\u00a0goes to print, they all meet in Marty's office, and he looks through a hard copy of the story, crossing out words, murmuring to himself, \"Adjectives.\" That is a newspaper man.\u00a0 Holed up in a cluttered basement office, the Spotlight team exhibit the behavior of people who spend more time with one another than they do with their own families. Personal details about their lives are at a minimum. Sacha goes to church every Sunday with her grandmother, a ritual she finds increasingly painful. Rezendes' marriage is on the rocks. Matty has a couple of kids, and a big magnet on his refrigerator emblazoned with an American flag and \"Remember 9/11\" on it. We know who these people are.\u00a0 Advertisement At first the team focuses on one former priest, John J. Geoghan, alleged to have molested many children years ago. But Baron urges them to remember that the story is bigger than just one \"bad apple\" priest. He wants to go after the whole system. The corruption is obviously systemic, but the key issue becomes: did Cardinal Law know? That's the big game Spotlight is after. \"The Curse of the Bambino\" may have taught Baron\u00a0about Red Sox Nation, but a meet-and-greet with Cardinal Law (a creepily sincere Len Cariou) during Baron's first week on the job is even more illuminating. Baron is stunned at Law's assumption that the Boston Globe would work with\u00a0the Catholic Church.\u00a0 Sacha and Michael question the adult victims willing to come forward, who are so traumatized they can't find the words to describe what was taken from them. A couple of lawyers (played by Billy Crudup and Stanley Tucci) sit on opposite ends of the spectrum of dealing with the Catholic Church from a legal standpoint.\u00a0 McCarthy and his entire team, from production designers to location scouts to extras casting directors, get Boston right. Different neighborhoods (Back Bay, Southie) are used as shorthand for entire worlds. There are clear class divides (predator priests often worked in low-income neighborhoods, targeting boys who needed father figures). The atmosphere is very \"Boston\": having a beer on the back porch in the dead of winter or arguing about work over hot dogs at Fenway. Boston, with its confusing colonial-era streets and church spires jutting into the sky on practically every corner, is the soul of the movie. \"Spotlight\" feels\u00a0local. \"Spotlight\" also shows\u00a0a deeper truth, the level of psychological trauma brought on by abuse, not just to the victims, but to horrified Catholics everywhere. \"Spotlight\" takes faith seriously. An ex-priest turned psychiatrist is an important source, and when he's asked how Catholics reconcile the abuse scandal with their faith, he replies, \"My faith is in the eternal. I try to separate the two.\" Mark Ruffalo modulates his performance over the course of the film at a world-class level, moving from a patient dogged investigator to a rumpled maniac racing through courthouses, chasing down cabs and screaming at his boss. In a raw moment, he confesses to Sacha that even though he stopped going to church years ago, he always assumed that one day he would go back. \"I had that in my back pocket,\" he says, glancing at her with a flash of anguish. \"Spotlight\" makes the issue of lost faith visceral by taking the time to let it breathe, letting it play its part in the story. Advertisement The newspaper world has changed a lot since 2002. Things look pretty grim. But good long-form journalism still exists (the recent New York Times series about the conditions for nail salon workers is a good example). Such work is as important now as it has ever been. \"Spotlight\" is the kind of movie where a scene showing a group of reporters huddled over church directories, taking notes in silence, becomes\u00a0a gripping sequence. (It's reminiscent of the row of mission control guys in \"Apollo 13,\" whipping out their slide rules as one, thereby almost single-handedly expanding\u00a0the concept of heroism.)\u00a0\"Spotlight,\" with all its pain and urgency, is a pure celebration of journalists doing what they do best.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "68 Kill", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201c68 Kill,\u201d Trent Haaga\u2019s adaptation of Bryan Smith\u2019s novel of the same name, starts with a propulsive, grungy energy that works for about a half an hour. It\u2019s the story of a young man caught up in the allure of every beautiful woman he encounters, even if they\u2019re homicidal maniacs. It opens with a shot of a fly stuck in honey. Clearly, our male lead is the doomed bug, and the honey is, well, you get it. At its best, it recalls the \u201ccast of crooks, most of them morons\u201d aesthetic of writers like Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiaasen, and it often has the energy of the late-\u201890s crime movies that sprung up in the massive wake of \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d The film\u2019s biggest problem is that its greatest asset disappears for way too long and her absence allows one to notice the thin characters and lack of witty dialogue. This is the kind of piece that needs to move 100MPH from first scene to last for you to overlook its flaws. It slows down for too long to recommend the ride. Advertisement Matthew Gray Gubler is effective as Chip, the kind of na\u00efve, All-American kid who too easily trusts people and rarely considers the outcome of his actions. He literally shovels shit for a living as a sewer worker, and his girlfriend Liza (AnnaLynne McCord) was a former stripper and hooker who\u2019s tired of having to bang her landlord when she can\u2019t pay rent. When she discovers that said landlord has $68,000 in a safe, she convinces Chip to help her steal it. Things go very wrong for Chip and Liza, and they\u2019re soon on the run with a witness named Violet (Alisha Boe) in the trunk. However, Liza has no qualms about doing what needs to be done with the pretty girl\u2014she\u2019s going to sell her to her brother, a man who tortures women for sexual pleasure. Yes, it\u2019s that kind of dark movie. Pitch black. And it\u2019s as if Chip is seeing the danger and moral depravity of the world for the first time. He\u2019s got to get away from Liza. Now. McCord is easily the best thing about \u201c68 Kill,\u201d finding the balance between a traditional femme fatale and something more akin to \u201cAmerican Psycho.\u201d She captures a woman who knows how to use her beauty to her advantage, but is sick and tired of having to do so. She\u2019ll take what she thinks she deserves however she can possibly can, whether it\u2019s sleeping someone like Chip or cutting someone\u2019s throat who crosses her. She\u2019s not so much a sociopath as someone who has simply stopped caring about the alleged order of a world that has given her nothing; so now she takes. McCord makes smarter decisions here than most other actresses would. The problem is that the movie sidelines her in ways I won\u2019t spoil, and we\u2019re stuck with Gubler and Boe, particularly grating as they get into a potential love subplot. The movie feels like a writing struggling to figure out where to take his characters in an extended midsection at a motel and then again in a dark final act in which Chip crosses paths with another crazy killer woman (Sheila Vand of \u201cA Girl Walks Home at Night\u201d). It\u2019s here when you notice that Haaga doesn\u2019t quite have the visual language as a director to make this as gritty and intense as it should have been\u2014the stakes don\u2019t feel real even as bodies are being mutilated\u2014and he doesn\u2019t have the ear for dialogue as a writer to make the characters feel like more than devices. \u201c68 Kill\u201d can\u2019t quite sustain its short running time, lacking enough character or plot to keep its cinematic engine moving, especially after it loses its turbo drive of a leading lady.

{"Title": "A Monster Calls", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "A lot of colleagues seem to have been under the impression\u2014maybe because of the title combined with the fact that director J.A. Bayona made \u201cThe Orphanage\u201d\u2014that this is a straight-up genre film, a conventional monster movie. Boy, were they ever surprised by \u201cA Monster Calls,\u201d which is in fact a metaphorical allegory of childhood, illness, death, and grief. And an often very powerful film. Based on a novel by Patrick Ness, who also wrote the screenplay (the book itself was initially conceived as an idea by the late writer Siobhan Dowd, who is also credited in the film), \u201cA Monster Calls\u201d brings viewers into the ramshackle British household of young Conor and his unnamed mother. Their residence looks out onto a church and graveyard that seem guarded by a giant yew tree. Conor (Lewis MacDougall), a restless, shy, bullied kid who\u2019s an ardent daydreamer, artist\u2014and inchoate monster-movie lover\u2014dreams one night of the tree breaking apart, and yielding a giant man of wood. Tree-men and like figures have deep roots (sorry) in Anglo mythology, but the monster who invades Conor\u2019s dreams\u2014whose insides are animated by terrifying, never-ebbing flames\u2014belongs to Conor alone. Speaking in intimidating intonations supplied by Liam Neeson, the monster informs Conor that he is going to appear to him to tell him three stories. And once the monster\u2019s stories are done, he will command of Conor the kid\u2019s own story, and an ultimate attendant truth that only Conor can articulate.  Advertisement This situation would seem challenging under the best of circumstances. Of course, the movie understands that the situation wouldn\u2019t arise at all under the best of circumstances. Conor\u2019s mother, a young woman herself, played by Felicity Jones, is direly ill, and has been for some time. She\u2019s a one-time artist who put aside her dreams once Conor was born. The boy\u2019s father, Toby Kebbell, has a whole other life in Los Angeles now. Conor\u2019s grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) is a stern intimidating figure who on the outset seems entirely disagreeable. We don\u2019t know it at first, but we suspect it: all the adults in Conor\u2019s family, however well-intentioned, are lying to him. His visits from his tree frenemy help him to reckon with that, albeit in an unconventional way.  When the monster calls, his tendrils wrap around the furniture in Conor\u2019s bedroom, and these tendrils themselves seem to grip the boy as the monster tells fables of kings and queens that end in frustrating paradox, confusing Conor. The boy and his beloved mom have moments of respite, enjoying a 16mm print of the 1933 \u201cKing Kong\u201d together, with Mom telling Conor it was a favorite of his late grandfather, who was the only person who could get Grandma to lighten up. These casually dropped bits of history become crucial as the film digs deeper and deeper into the realities of Conor\u2019s situation and the parables of the fantastic figure who helps him deal with that situation, despite Conor\u2019s furious opposition.  This is a very unusual picture, whether you\u2019re viewing as an adult or a teen, but it\u2019s not unprecedented. It has some genuine affinities with the underrated 1986 \u201cLabyrinth,\u201d in which Jennifer Connelly confronted a looming transition from girlhood to womanhood via a fantasy realm ruled by an elfin David Bowie. In that film, as in this one, a close examination of the characters\u2019 family photos yields useful clues as to what\u2019s \u201creally\u201d going on. But \u201cA Monster Calls\u201d is putting its young protagonist through a much tougher transition process, and as such the visions, and the challenges, are more wrenching and terrifying.  Advertisement While the giant tree monster\u2014in many scenes an actual animatronic creation, in the \u201cKong\u201d tradition\u2014is a formidable, fantastic effect, and the design and animation of his tales is first-rate, there are portions of the movie that are frenetically over-directed. Bayona\u2019s a formidable talent, and he\u2019s not out to discombobulate his audience in the manner of Michael Bay, but there are times when he\u2019s trying to do too much at once. The story also has some speed bumps. Too many movies nowadays depicting bullying among young people fall back on a very lazy audience-pleasing trick. That is, to have the victim get so mad he\u2019s just not going to take it anymore, and he gives the bully a good walloping. Never mind that this isn\u2019t how it works in real life, but the scene doesn\u2019t actually line up with the idea the tree monster wants to impart to Conor. That the buildup to the confrontation partakes in some peculiar possible gay-panic tension doesn\u2019t so much provide thematic enrichment as it does muddy the waters. (The aftermath of the incident does, however, give Bayona the opportunity to feature the great Geraldine Chaplin in a cameo role, so that\u2019s welcome.)  But once \u201cA Monster Calls\u201d settles in for its wrenching climax, and the revelation of Conor\u2019s \u201ctruth,\u201d it becomes both heart-squeezing and philosophically provocative. That the movie is beautiful to look at is a given, if you know Bayona\u2019s prior films, but sometimes it gets you in that department when you\u2019re least expecting it. A conversation between Conor and his grandmother during a rainy drive to the hospital, when the car is stopped for a passing train, is framed in beautiful autumnal running colors outside their car windows (the director of photography is \u00d3scar Faura, who has worked with Bayona on all his features); it\u2019s not only visually breathtaking but emotionally consonant and resonant. Despite its shortcomings, there are things about this film that are hard to shake; the movie\u2019s ultimate wisdom and overarching compassion make it very likely that you won\u2019t want to shake them, after all.", "Critic": "Gamma"}

He pantomimes when he talks, taking a minor leap when he says the word \u201cbounding\u201d or pretending to color with crayons. At several points in \u201cEnlighten Us,\u201d he allows a peek behind the curtain. For example, there\u2019s an amazing bit in which he talks about the impact of blocking his motivational speeches, how it works psychologically to keep issues of the past stage right and issues of the future stage left, because that\u2019s how our eyes work when we\u2019re reading.\u00a0 \u201cEnlighten Us\u201d could have used even more of this deconstruction of the art of motivational speaking but Carchman allows it to come through what is basically a character study of a man seeking redemption. After the deadly incident, Ray served two years in jail\u2014a number that seemed to satisfy nobody, as his victims\u2019 families thought he should have gotten more while he thought he should have gotten none. His redemption arc, in which Ray tries to rebuild a career in which HE is the primary product, is interesting enough but it\u2019s shadowed by the ghosts of those who died in Arizona, and a sense that Ray himself has yet to fully process what happened there. There are times when he suggests that what happened to him was a good thing because he\u2019s now learning and growing through challenge\u2014and I suppose there\u2019s no other way to look at it that wouldn\u2019t just send a human being into the fetal position. But it still leaves a bad taste to consider the deaths of others as something positive. Ray's comeback arc only gets \u201cEnlighten Us\u201d so far. And that\u2019s why the final act of Carchman\u2019s film is so effective and harrowing. She turns her focus, for large portions of the documentary, to the survivors of the Sedona incident, allowing them to detail what happened beat by beat. A picture of a totally unorganized, dangerous event comes clearer, and the idea that Ray must bear some legal and moral responsibility for it is crystalized. Yes, they had done it several times before, but Ray was not just in charge on that day but in several areas of these peoples\u2019 lives. They couldn\u2019t look weak in front of him. They trusted him. And the final act of \u201cEnlighten Us\u201d returns the story to these people, humanizing them in a way that makes them relatable and understandable instead of the cable news habit of labeling them cult members. Why would you do something that could kill you? And how responsible are you if you tell someone that their way toward enlightenment is something that could kill them, all while giant profit margins are involved? What I like about \u201cEnlighten Us\u201d is that it never claims to have all the answers. No one does. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Sightseers", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Sardonic grim humor with a black heart is the tone of \"Sightseers,\" not surprising when you consider that it was directed by Ben Wheatley, whose former films, \"Down Terrace\" (2009) and \"Kill List\" (2011), were black comedy thrillers involving crime, murder and the absence of a moral compass. \"Sightseers\" is part travelogue and part killing spree, and Tina and Chris rightfully take their place with other murderous couples on the run, from Annie and Barton in \"Gun Crazy\" (1950) to Kit and Holly in \"Badlands\" (1973) to Mickey and Mallory in \"Natural Born Killers\" (1994). Advertisement It's not immediately apparent that Chris is a killer. He just wants to show off his knowledge to Tina and have a nice holiday. The problem is, Chris can't let things go. Things like rudeness, boorish self-absorption, and being serenely happy grate on this resentful man. Tina, amazed by all the sex she is having, heady with freedom, tries to soothe him.\u00a0 At their first stop, the Crich Tramway Village, they ride old-fashioned double-deckers. Unfortunately, a big goon drops his candy wrapper on the floor, and Chris forces a confrontation, making everyone uncomfortable. Later, Chris sees an opportunity and takes it, backing over the unrepentant litterbug with his caravan, crushing him to death. Tina and Chris soap the blood off the tires and dump the body. Chris feels that litterbugs like this chap ruin everything, and, even worse, this particular squashed litterbug has now ruined the Tram Museum for him. And that, that he cannot forgive. Chris has a motive behind his madness, in other words, which cracks open the deeper themes of the film. What does it mean to be an English person? Chris is quite proper in his attitudes. One should not litter. One should not flaunt one's good fortune. Those who refuse to play by those rules, well, they are a blot on the face of humanity and who will miss them anyway? The wild Midlands area is the site of ancient kingdoms, resonating with the memory of medieval greatness. It was also the engine of the Industrial Revolution. Part of the British ethos is politeness, a sort of \"No, no, you first\" attitude, and Chris is at war with himself: He is sick of coming in second. During one of the more gruesome killings, the incantatory words of British visionary William Blake, who wrote a lot about the downtrodden, echo from the screen:\u00a0 <i>And did those feet in ancient time Walk upon England's mountains green? And was the holy Lamb of God On England's pleasant pastures seen?</i> The British ideal is pastoral. Educated Victorian gentleman would take walking tours through the countryside, honing their observational skills of the natural world. Slobby Chris is the modern-day embodiment of that Victorian personality. But the connecting links are buried in the mists of time, leaving only incendiary class resentment. Chris bashes in the head of a snotty tourist in an isolated moor, and Tina whines, \"I never thought about murdering an innocent person before.\" Chris replies, \"He's not a person. He's a Daily Mail reader.\"\u00a0 Advertisement At one campsite, a group of \"shamans from Portsmouth\" drum incessantly in a nearby field. Tina imagines herself joining them, dancing with abandon. Murder becomes her way out. She has a taste for it. But Tina is sloppy in her murders. Chris fancies himself an intellectual, and the people he murders represent everything he hates about England and modern man. Tina, on the other hand, just pushes a woman enjoying her bachelorette party over a nearby bridge for no reason!\u00a0 Alice Lowe and Steve Oram are both stand-up comedians from the Midlands area. They came up with these characters together, and \"Sightseers\" began as a series of sketches, which they then developed. They created a short, which got the attention of Edgar Wright, director of \"Shaun of the Dead.\" Wright saw the feature-film potential in this dark material and brought it to director Ben Wheatley's attention. Lowe and Oram have been living with these characters for years, and it shows. The acting is very funny and well-observed. Tina is always trailing after Chris, with a kind of hesitant shuffling walk, saying his name repeatedly, \"Chris ... Chris ... Chris ...\"\u00a0 The scenery the killers travel through is breathtaking, with the melancholy grandeur of English landscapes: fields and fog, lonely roads winding through green. The past is all around Tina and Chris, the greatness of England's history shimmers behind every action. They cannot access the power inherent in such a history, it is denied them. Chris begins to seem more and more trapped in the abyss between his ideals and his reality, and Tina starts to seem more and more released from the ties that bind. The ending, when it comes, is perfect. Of course it would end this way. \u00a0Director Wheatley has already shown his aptitude for sardonic horror-commentaries, and \"Sightseers\" is his best film to date. \"Sightseers\" is dark, gruesome, blithely amoral and thoroughly entertaining.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Power Rangers", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Loud, trashy, sweet and weird, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers reboot \u201cPower Rangers\u201d is not merely an ideal film for rambunctious and undemanding 12-year olds, it actually sees the world through their eyes.  In theory, the heroes are high school students. But they\u2019re actually a Disney Channel-styled fantasy of the splendors that await kids when they finally become full-fledged teenagers and can Do Whatever They Want. These heroes are misfits. They gather in detention in their high school, a scenario that promises to turn into \u201cThe Mighty Morphin Breakfast Club Rangers.\u201d Lo and behold, that\u2019s what you get: a mix of shenanigans, heart-to-heart talks and widescreen punch-outs between monster battles. Advertisement The team consists of Jason Scott (Dacre Montgomery), the future Red Ranger, a juvenile delinquent with a barely disguised noble streak; Kimberly Hart (Naomi Scott), aka Pink Ranger, a depressive who\u2019s in detention for texting an embarrassing private photo of a classmate; Billy Cranston (RJ Cyler), aka Blue Ranger, who\u2019s got a spectrum disorder in this version; Becky G as Trini, the soon-to-be Yellow Power Ranger, who stays a blank slate until the movie fills in her backstory during the second half; and Ludi Lin as Zack, the Black Ranger, who was African-American in the original TV series but has been cast as Asian here.  The teens are trained by Zordon (Bryan Cranston), sole survivor of a prehistoric battle that ended with a meteor wiping out the dinosaurs. He wants them to defend the Earth against his nemesis, Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks), by karate-kicking and body slamming Rita\u2019s beloved stone golems, then joining forces to defeat a gigantic golden warrior called Goldar.  There's a plot about the Rangers trying to protect a crystal hidden inside a Krispy Kreme donut shop, and a detailed mythology about the life force of planets, but while Rangers purists will appreciate the fine points, the film doesn't get too hung up on them. The best way to save humanity, Zordon explains, is to kill Rita. To drive this point home, the film repeats the phrase \u201ckill Rita\u201d so often and with such zeal that it becomes a shared joke between the movie and the audience. \u201cLet's go and do the one thing that's been asked of us and kill Rita!\" Jason exhorts his colleagues. \u201cI shall destroy Rita myself!\u201d Zordon proclaims when the training isn\u2019t going so well.  The \u201cstronger together\u201d message of the original show has been given a post-Obama makeover here, sometimes convincingly, other times awkwardly. The film\u2019s marketing hypes the fact that Trini has been re-imagined as the first openly gay superhero in movie history, and that is quite a milestone; but if you go out for popcorn in the scene where that\u2019s established you might not figure it out, unless you detect the undertones of Sapphic menace in the scene where Rita bullies Trini in her bedroom. (It\u2019s like when Paramount congratulated itself for making Sulu gay in \u201cStar Trek Beyond\u201d when all it did was give audiences a two-second glimpse of a photo revealing that Sulu's significant other was a man. Um, thanks?)  Advertisement Billy, however, becomes a genuinely memorable character, thanks mainly to Cyler\u2019s heartfelt performance (which overcomes a lot of fuzziness about what, exactly, the character\u2019s condition is). And the screenplay makes this cheerful kid the heart and soul of the group, and sometimes its comic relief, without sapping him of dignity.\u00a0Zack fares well, too: he loudly advertises himself as the \u201ccrazy\u201d one, but in private moments he cares for his sickly mother with the same grim matter-of-factness that the title character of \"Logan\" brought into Professor X\u2019s room along with meals and meds. (Zack and his mom speak Mandarin with English subtitles, a nice touch.) Writer John Gatins and director Dean Israelite make sure to take the characters\u2019 emotions seriously even as they celebrate the ridiculousness of everything else. Nailing the tone in a film like this is so important that if you manage it, the audience will forgive missteps. There are plenty here, including haphazard plotting, connect-the-dots characterizations, and nervous, jittery, over-edited filmmaking that only snaps into coherence during a handful of crisp action scenes (the best is an opening car chase done in a single take from inside a moving vehicle, \u00e0 la \u201cLet Me In\u201d and \u201cChildren of Men\u201d).  But every time your eyes are about to roll back into your head at the film\u2019s slovenly direction and editing, it\u2019ll throw in moments of pathos or images of eerie beauty (everything involving gold or water is aces). Or it will veer into three-hanky melodrama and inflict distress or bodily harm on a character you\u2019re surprised to realize you\u2019ve grown to like. The action is decent, occasionally splendid, near the end, although there are sure to be complaints that the movie takes too long to get the teens into their armor. It also hits too many overly familiar action film beats (including a side-by-side power walk), but if it hadn't, a lot of viewers would wonder why the filmmakers were stinting on the stuff they came to see (the power walk is pretty great).  Advertisement What stands out about the film\u2014and what consistently saves it, even when the direction is at its cruddiest\u2014is its sincerity. \u201cPower Rangers\u201d really does believe that people are stronger united than when they\u2019re going it alone, and it embeds that conviction into its action scenes. It also encourages its supporting players to cut loose and have fun, and boy, do they: Bill Hader\u2019s training robot is pleasingly droll. \u201cThis is the pit,\u201d he chirps, showing the heroes a pit full of dirt and rocks, then adds, \u201cIt\u2019s great, right?\u201d Banks\u2019 slinky performance seems modeled equally on Tim Curry\u2019s Dr. Frank-N-Furter and Sigourney Weaver as the demon-possessed Dana in the original \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d She walks with slightly wobbly confidence, like a society lady who\u2019s too old to be wearing such high heels. This is a film where a character's dad drives a pickup truck into the middle of a superhero battle to make sure his son is okay, and another character shouts \u201cI love my mom!\u201d so joyously that it echoes in the canyons. I\u2019ve seen complaints that \u201cPower Rangers\u201d is too crude in its humor, too precious in how it establishes its characters' outsider status, and too obvious about its product placement (the words \u201cKrispy Kreme\u201d  are spoken nearly as often as \u201ckill Rita\u201d). All three charges are true. But I'd also suggest that a viewer's level of offense will likely be proportionate to how  thoughtful they expected a film like this to be. The  Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is a subsidiary of Saban Entertainment, created to sell merchandise. It never had much artistic integrity to lose, so the  fact that this film actually has some is amazing. This big-budget teen fantasy is essentially an unauthorized \"Transformers\" movie that has a moral code and is suitable for kids, in stark contrast to the actual \"Transformers\" franchise, which has prided itself on being snide, leering and hateful. \"Power Rangers\" is earnest and it has a good heart. There should be more movies like it, only better-made.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Son of Joseph", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The story of theater and film artist Eug\u00e8ne Green sounds like that of a character made up by Umberto Eco or Gilbert Adair. Born in New York in the late 1940s, he decamped to Paris while still a young man. Once settled in Europe, he made his life work the revival of the traditions of Baroque French theater, particularly a declamatory style of direct address. He\u2019s mounted many plays, published many books. He has been compared to the conductor Nikolaus von Harnoncourt, a pioneer in the \u201coriginal instruments\u201d movement of playing classical music. But his pursuit and championing of baroque modes does not end at traditional forms. He has been making films since the turn of the century, many of them parables that extol old-world values in modern settings.  Advertisement His new picture \u201cSon of Joseph,\u201d opens with credits on white type against a black background, some stirring Baroque choral music, and shots of schoolkids\u2019 feet as they leave their building. A title card announces the movie\u2019s first chapter, \u201cThe Sacrifice of Abraham.\u201d In a basement, a couple of teen boys\u2014they were among the schoolkids, we infer\u2014have trapped a rat, and they\u2019re holding it in a cage, prodding it with rods and saying mean things to it. (This is the most unpleasant imagery in the whole movie and press materials insist the rat was unharmed and has retired from acting.) One of them asks \u201cWhere\u2019s Vincent?\u201d We next see the kid who opted not to partake in rat torture. He is Vincent, surly, fresh-faced, tormented. He shoplifts a screwdriver from a hardware store, and immediately brings it back. He has a tortured relationship with truth. After he snoops into his mother\u2019s desk to find correspondence that reveals the identity of his father, who\u2019s been absent his whole life, he readily admits to his mother that he did it. She slaps him and he takes it. But he then crashes a party hosted by his father, the top editor at a major publishing house, and tells a ditzy literary critic in attendance that he\u2019s that editor\u2019s latest enfant terrible find. What does Vincent want? Well, he wants a family. On encountering a happy male/female couple sitting at a caf\u00e9, he glowers at them; the camera tilts up to show the name of the caf\u00e9 is \u201cPere et Fils.\u201d One of his rat-torturing buddies offers him a business proposition. \u201cI sell sperm on the Internet,\u201d pal Dean tells Vincent. \u201cWho\u2019s your supplier?\u201d Vincent asks. \u201cI am,\u201d says Dean, sighing. \u201cBut supplies are limited.\u201d Almost all the signifiers in the early part of the picture are about parenting, reproduction. And, of course, the unusual nature of what it is to be related to someone, either by blood or humanity. The circumstances mess with the super-serious Vincent to the extent that they compel him to invade the sparsely-furnished hotel suite that serves as his wayward father\u2019s office. There, he role-reverses the sacrifice of Abraham by handcuffing his father to his chair and holding a blade to his throat. At which point he is met with a vision.  Did I mention this movie is a comedy? It is, and a very sure-footed one, although the style does take some getting used to. Between the meticulously composed framing\u2014 sometimes breaking down bodies to their component parts, sometimes privileging the talking head\u2014and the clear, deadpan delivery of the dialogue, one might be tempted to say that Green accomplishes the not-as-unlikely-as-it-sounds fusion of Bresson and Kaurismaki. But this would be inaccurate, because \u201cSon of Joseph\u201d doesn\u2019t actually feel like a fusion or pastiche. Green is on to his own thing, and while it takes some getting used to, it ultimately provides big rewards both in entertainment (I found it reliably warm and funny) and Stuff with a Capital S (its adaptation and elaboration of Biblical themes posits some worthwhile moral propositions).\u00a0 Advertisement Green\u2019s magnificent cast is another big plus. Young Victor Ezenfis, as Vincent, can go from irritating to endearing without actually seeming to change a thing about his bearing. The great Natacha R\u00e9gnier is a warm and credible mother Marie. The very great Mathieu Amalric reins in his bug-eyed madness but still registers strongly as the arrogant but harebrained book man Oscar Pormenor. Maria de Medeiros is hilarious as a daintily pretentious literary critic. And Fabrizio Rongione, the Belgian actor who\u2019s a veteran of the work of the Dardenne brothers (who co-produced this film) and starred in Green\u2019s last film, \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d is almost as beatific as Regnier in the role of Joseph, the man Vincent chooses to be his new dad. I won\u2019t spoil the ending\u2014although you can probably guess some of it\u2014but it\u2019s as enigmatic and strangely satisfying as many of this unique film's best scenes.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Pacific Rim", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "If I were nine years old, I would see the monsters-versus-robots adventure \"Pacific Rim\" 50 times. Because I'm in my forties and have two kids and two jobs, I'll have to be content with seeing it a couple more times in theaters and re-watching it on video.  Like George Lucas' original 1977 \"Star Wars\", Guillermo del Toro's sci-fi actioner uses high technology to pump up disreputable subject matter to Hollywood blockbuster levels. The film's main selling point is its overscaled action sequences. In a terrified futureworld, spindly-limbed, whale-sized beasts emerge from a Hellmouth on the ocean floor and duke it out with immense robots. The robots are run by two-pilot teams whose movements suggest tai chi exercises taking place on the world's largest, weirdest elliptical machines. They work in pairs because they use their minds and bodies to guide the machines in the way that puppeteers guide puppets, and the technology is too complex for a single brain to handle.  Advertisement The creatures began attacking years before the start of the story proper (we get the history in a prologue). The humans can't fight the monsters by conventional military means because it causes too much collateral damage. They created the robots \u2014 called Jaegers \u2014 to engage them directly, before the creatures, called Kaiju, could make landfall. Over time the beasts have become bigger, nastier, more resourceful, as if they're evolving. And now they seem to be winning. Humankind is in retreat. The fight scenes are often shot too close-in for my taste, and they go on too long, particularly during the final stretch \u2014 a problem that also afflicted\"Iron Man 3,\" \"Star Trek Into Darkness,\" \"Man of Steel\" and other recent summer films \u2014 and there are times when one of the combatants will use a weapon so devastating that you wonder why they didn't just haul it out at the start of the fight and make the punching, kicking and flipping unnecessary.  Nitpicks aside, though, the fights are astonishing. They split the difference between classical filmmaking and the blurrier, more chaotic modern style in a way that made me appreciate the virtues of both. Some of the whirling action has a geometric beauty that's faintly Cubist, and each fight contains surprises: a tactic you haven't seen yet, a power you didn't know about, a complication you didn't see coming. But for all its mayhem, \"Pacific Rim\" is a film with more more emotion than its trailers could have led you to expect. The hero, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) is an ace pilot who gave up robot-piloting for coastal wall-building when his partner and older brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) died fighting a monster. The pilots don't just share physical responsibilities, they have unfettered access to one another's memories, and must struggle not just to control their thoughts during combat, but to avoid being thrown off when their co-pilot lets a distracting or traumatic image slip through. Raleigh thinks the bond he had with his brother can never be replicated, that his loss was irreplaceable. He learns otherwise when he's paired with a young woman named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), who lost her parents in a Tokyo monster attack many years earlier. The story of their burgeoning partnership is not just that of pilot/copilot, but brother/sister, or friend/friend (but not boyfriend/girlfriend, refreshingly). It's about learning to trust another person enough to allow their consciousness to fuse with yours. Advertisement The film contains many more examples of this sort of human dyad, including Mako and the robot fighters' commanding officer Stacker Penetcost (Idris Elba), who feels fatherly tenderness toward Mako and doesn't want her risking her life, and scientists Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), who try to understand the kaiju's biology, and haggle over whether to use an intuitive or data-based approach. (\"Numbers are as close as we come to the handwriting of God,\" Gottlieb says; he's right, but not as right as he thinks.)  The movie's action is physical, but it's also metaphorical. The metaphors are articulated with such storybook directness and unabashed sentiment that by the end, I found myself thinking about what it means to be in a relationship, be it comprised of siblings, coworkers, lovers, or parents and kids. These people are all just comic-book types, with ridiculous names and cliched back-stories. But their feelings are real. They feel pain. They dream. \"Pacific Rim\" stuffs each frame with multiple references to the latest iterations of what even geeks would call \"Geek Culture.\" But for all his fanboy enthusiasm, Del Toro is also a man of taste\u2014that's why he clothed Elba, the most dashing man alive, in a suit and tie rather than a standard sci-fi military general's uniform. There are the expected shout-outs to Godzilla pictures and such robot-driven anime as \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", plus hat-tips to George Lucas (in the opening section, the hero's older brother quotes Han Solo's \"Don't get cocky, kid\"), and way too many borrowings from the shlocky \"Independence Day.\"\u00a0But there are also nods to Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Mary Shelley's original \"Frankenstein,\" \"2001,\" \"Brainstorm,\" \"Inception,\" and the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft, whose descriptions of demon-creatures must have informed this picture's effects. (Maybe now Del Toro will get to make his long-dreamed-of Lovecraft adaptation \"At the Mountains of Madness.\") There are many shots so striking that they could have served as the poster image: A Jaeger tumbling into an abyss, its E.T. heart pulsing; a little girl's red shoe in a grey ash-heap on a rubble-strewn street; a kaiju unfurling kite-like wings; a one-eyed kaiju-body-parts dealer named Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) stalking through wreckage, his steel-tipped dress shoes jangling like cowboy spurs. A simple shot of Elba's character taking off a helmet is infused with such emotion, thanks to its placement in the story and the sunlight haloing the actor's head, that it would have made John Wayne cry. Advertisement Del Toro and his cowriter Travis Beacham have thought about how daily life, indeed consciousness itself, might change if something like this happened to the planet. There's a hilarious clip of a TV talk show during the overconfident period in which humans thought they'd defeated the beasts: the host teases a giant sea-beast puppet that looks like an ugly, melted Barney the Dinosaur.\u00a0The names of significant machines and locations have a fairy-tale rightness: \"Shatterdome.\" \"The Bone Slum.\" \"Crimson Typhoon.\" \"Trespasser.\" The sea walls and cityscapes seem beaten down, jury-rigged, exhausted. This world existed long before you started looking at it. A few hours after I saw \"Pacific Rim\" for the first time, I had objections to one aspect or another. Days later I can't remember most of them, and in the grand scheme, I don't believe they matter, any more than the \"flaws\" of \"Star Wars\" or \"The Wizard of Oz\" matter.\u00a0\"Pacific Rim\" knows what sort of film it wishes to be; it is that film, and much more. In its clanking, crashing way, it's real science fiction, a play of ideas. It's earnest in its belief that all thinking beings are part of a hive mind, or could be. You see the notion acted out onscreen in teams of two or three, in military units and small businesses, in city populations and whole species. This movie made me think of a line from Roger Ebert's review of \"Dark City,\" which he described as \"a film to nourish us. Not a story so much as an experience, it is a triumph of art direction, set design, cinematography, special effects--and imagination.\"", "Critic": "Delta"}

His film was clearly influenced by Nicolas\r\nWinding Refn, David Lynch and Terrence Malick, and one gets the distinct impression\r\nthat mimicking filmmakers with such confident visual sensibilities may not have\r\nbeen the best way for a rookie director to get his feet wet. The result is a\r\npiece with images that connect only superficially, never finding the thematic\r\nresonance of a Lynch or Malick vision. Gosling\u2019s eye is too confident to\r\nignore, but one hopes he points it at a more-engaging product next time. Advertisement \u201cLost River\u201d takes place in a totally desolate and\r\nnearly-destroyed Detroit, in which Billy (Christina Hendricks) and her son\r\nBones (Iain De Caestecker) struggle to make ends meet. She\u2019s three months\r\nbehind on the mortgage payments; he spends his days scrounging burned-out\r\nbuildings for copper. In the world of \u201cLost River\u201d, there are predators\r\neverywhere for people already on the edge of society; people who exist to pull\r\nthem into the abyss. Billy\u2019s comes in the form of the new employee she meets at\r\nthe bank named Dave (Ben Mendolsohn), who has a proposition for her to make\r\nmore money. Bones\u2019 comes in the form of Bully (Matt Smith), a freakish villain\r\nwho drives around town with a megaphone warning those considering stealing his\r\ncopper that they better \u201clook at his muscles\u201d first.  Exhausting all of her options, Billy takes up Dave\u2019s offer\r\nto work at an exclusive, hidden nightclub, at which female performers pretend\r\nto mutilate and disfigure themselves. Run by the charismatic Cat (Eva Mendes),\r\nevery night\u2019s show includes paying customers who just want to be washed in the\r\nfake blood of beautiful women. And, of course, there\u2019s something even more\r\nnefarious, but more profitable, for Billy in the basement of this disturbing\r\nestablishment. Dave tells Billy that he goes town to town, setting up these\r\nexhibitions of violence, even in poor areas, and makes a fortune. The\r\ncommentary on mass-produced re-creations of horror is a bit underlined and\r\nhighlighted, but it leads to some striking imagery, including Hendricks\r\ncasually taking off her face. Meanwhile, Bones\u2019 only friend Rat (Saoirse Ronan) tells him\r\nabout an underwater city, at the bottom of the reservoir. The story goes that\r\nthe modern Atlantis was flooded, and the submerging of it led to a curse on the\r\npeople above. Bones becomes convinced he needs to retrieve an item from there\r\nto lift the curse and bring happiness to Billy and Rat.  From early on, it\u2019s clear that Gosling is not concerned with\r\ntraditional narrative, as much as he is fever dream filmmaking, enhanced by a\r\nRefn-esque techno score and imagery that conveys directorial intention more\r\nthan dialogue. After searching for copper, Bones sees a bicycle on fire roll\r\nby. It is an image that only exists in film but it makes clear the\r\ndangerous world that Gosling is trying to capture. In this environment, Bones\u2019 little brother thinks there are monsters in his room. Gosling is visually conveying that there are\r\nmonsters everywhere, waiting to grab people who have run out of options.  Advertisement The problems with Golsing's film exist in that tried-and-true line between being\r\nmysterious & symbolic and just being self-indulgent. The best elements of \u201cLost\r\nRiver\u201d approach near fairy tale tones. There\u2019s a spell that needs to be broken,\r\na man who is missing part of his face, a grandmother who remains mute\u2014these feel\r\nlike beats from Grimm more than anything else. But Gosling doesn\u2019t have a grip\r\non them, and the film reverts back to Malick-esque scenes of lyricism and then into\r\nrelatively straightforward scenes of dialogue. In fact, those scenes, such as\r\nthe first between Hendricks and Mendelsohn, are the best in the film. Gosling\r\ndefinitely has a nice touch with actors, he just buries in them in so much\r\ncluttered, cinematic noise that they get lost themselves. And he really muddles\r\nthe ending, as we need more definition as to what is actually happening in a\r\nfew key climactic moments if we\u2019re expected to care, which I believe we are. I believe. It's hard to say what exactly Gosling wants us to take away from his debut. I am very curious to see what he does next, now that he's made an \"everything and the kitchen sink\" film of his most beloved influences. For now, \u201cLost River\u201d is one of those weird films that I think\r\nsome people will absolutely adore, grabbing on to its performances, imagery,\r\nand ideas, without really caring that they haven\u2019t been stitched together in an\r\ninteresting enough way.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Last Days on Mars", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"The Last Days on Mars\" is a movie that I, someone who grew up loving both science fiction and horror movies, rather wish I could like better. And it really isn't even a bad movie, or a bad movie of its sort. It's just not good enough to really distinguish itself.  As you might have guessed from its title, the movie does take place on Mars; a manned space expedition in the ever-popular not-too-distant-future is, again as you may have guessed, the expedition, as the viewer joins it, is coming to an end. As is customary in manned space expeditions in contemporary sci-fi cinema, this crew is multi-national, multi-ethnic, and mixed gender, although none of that really comes into play as the proceedings grow darker.\u00a0 Advertisement What sets things off is crew scientist Marko (Goran Kostic) cadging a few extra hours outdoors from commander Brunel (Elias Koteas) despite the fact that the whole crew ought to be taking part in an exit briefing. Marko's departure cheese off irritable uber-researcher Aldrich (Olivia Williams) and with better reason than she knows: having hid his true motives from Brunel, Marko's going out to check out some actual signs of life on Mars that he thinks he's discovered. Apparently he's a bit of a glory hog.  We never do find out what's motivating him, though, because once he gets outside he falls into a pit and comes back out looking like one of\r\nthe reanimated corpses in Tobe Hooper's semi-classic space-horror picture \"Lifeforce.\" If \"The Last Days on Mars\" has a closer kin, it's Mario Bava's '60s specialty classic \"Planet of the Vampires.\" With its imagining of Mars as a desert-like planet and its insistence on a sort of \"realism\" in portraying campsites on other planets and such, the movie's design and direction tends to eschew Bava's baroque stylings for \"Alien\"-like evocations of verisimilitude, although here director Ruairi Robinson seems to forget that those evocations of verisimilitude were themselves carefully\r\ncalculated baroque effects. Which is to say, in \"Alien\" strobe lighting was very carefully calibrated for maximum shock; here the strobe lighting is just, well, what things look like when an emergency strobe light goes off.  As more crew members get the bug that makes them lose their\r\nminds, lose their pulses, and turn into undead berserkers, lead actor Liev Schreiber tries to cope without any shoot-them-in-the-head weaponry, and to help spare fellow astronaut Romola Garai as well. Williams' character, and Johnny Harris as an overly chipper team physician, or therapist, or something, provide character complication for as long as character complication is deemed necessary. Inhibiting Schreiber from being all the hero he can be is an event from the journey over, conveyed in flashbacks that look as if they've been lifted from \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"  Advertisement The familiarity inherent in the elements at play here didn't breed contempt in this viewer, but by the same token, they didn't exactly make me sit up and take exceptional notice in the onscreen goings-on, which is the whole point of a genre exercise. The cast does its level best, the script doesn't pour on the clich\u00e9s too strenuously, but there's not enough here in terms of jolts and shocks and scares. A more ruthless momentum might have overcome the sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, but while I certainly didn't find anything to hate about \"The Last Days Of Mars,\" its main impact on me was reminding me of movies I might have rather been watching.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Legend", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "The Kray Brothers, Reggie and Ronnie, were such\r\nostentatiously violent and vulgar gangsters that they practically constituted a\r\nself-parody. They were both newly in jail when the then-also-new comedy troupe\r\nMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus deemed to lampoon them with a sketch about \u201cThe\r\nPiranha Brothers,\u201d Doug and Dinsdale, but the thing about that sketch, as it happened,\r\nwas just how little it needed to\r\nstray from reality in order to hit the comic mark. Nevertheless, the Krays, who\r\nruled criminal London from the late 1950s until their imprisonment in 1968, did\r\nreal and wide-ranging human harm in their careers; this is a fact that Brian\r\nHelgeland, writer and director of a new crime movie about the twins, doesn\u2019t\r\nseem to have any good ideas about what to do with. But that isn\u2019t why \u201cLegend\u201d\r\nis such a muddle right off the bat.  Advertisement Right off the bat it\u2019s a muddle because of Helgeland\u2019s\r\nslavish devotion to Martin Scorsese, a bad thing to display when you don\u2019t have\r\nScorsese\u2019s chops. Early on in the picture, as Reggie Kray, the relatively\r\ncharming, less psychotically violent of the fellows, is courting his future\r\nwife Frances, Helgeland opts to do a little \u201cGoodFellas.\u201d As Reggie escorts\r\nFrances into a pub where he\u2019s the kingpin, the moving camera follows from\r\nbehind and glides alongside the couple as various friends of Reggie pay their\r\nrespects. On a stage at the back, a singer is crooning \u201cThe Look of Love,\u201d a\r\nsong that had not actually been written when the scene takes place, but never\r\nmind that. You know where this is going. Helgeland wants to create his own\r\nversion of the famed Copacabana tracking shot in Scorsese\u2019s legendary 1990\r\ngangster film, but he hasn\u2019t quite worked out all the choreography\u2014hence, the\r\naforementioned singer ends up performing the world\u2019s longest version of \u201cThe\r\nLook of Love,\u201d at least until the point at which the sound editor or someone\r\ndecided to have mercy and faded the guy out and substituted some\r\ngeneric-sounding movie music. This is merely one example, and a pretty\r\noutstanding one. There are plenty more throughout the film. (All of this is\r\ndoubly stupefying when one recalls what a solid job Helgeland did in both\r\nwriting and directing departments in his last picture, the 2013 Jackie Robinson\r\nstory \u201c42.\u201d) The movie\u2019s main advantage and/or talking point is Tom\r\nHardy, who plays both twins. Reggie is slick and confident, while Ronnie, a\r\nparanoid schizophrenic with strong sadistic tendencies, is like Lenny in \u201cOf\r\nMice And Men\u201d if Lenny had been an East London mook, and evil to boot. Both\r\nperformances are commanding, but not as commanding as they might have been. The\r\nweaknesses of Helgeland\u2019s writing and directing are also to blame here.\r\nParticularly the latter: the unimaginative (and, I imagine, practically\r\nexpedient) framing of the two Hardys during scenes in which they\u2019re together\r\nmakes the dual performance play like a tricksy stunt at times. Helgeland could\r\nhave learned a great deal from the blocking of dual Jeremy Irons accomplished\r\nby David Cronenberg in \u201cDead Ringers,\u201d which made the viewer feel as if there\r\nwere really two different people in the frame. Too many times here there\u2019s the\r\nfeel of two different performances. Sometimes Hardy manages to ignite a spark.\r\nThere\u2019s a scene in which Chazz Palmentieri, playing a bluff emissary from the\r\nAmerican Mafia, makes the twins an offer they\u2019re better off not refusing,\r\nRonnie\u2019s belligerence notwithstanding. When Ronnie makes an unabashed\r\nannouncement concerning his sexual preferences to this wise guy, it\u2019s a real\r\nmoment. As is one with Hardy\u2019s Reggie, finally confessing at the end to his\r\nbrother why he\u2019s directing his own violent impulses so destructively into one\r\ntarget.  Moments such as these are too few and far between, while\r\nmoments such as a wedding scene prefaced by the song \u201cChapel of Love\u201d are far\r\ntoo many. The lucky bride is Reggie\u2019s, and her name is Frances, and it\u2019s with\r\nFrances\u2019 story that the movie, for me, broke away from irritating mediocrity\r\nand into genuine badness.  Helgeland\u2019s conception of Frances is doubly banal. First, he\r\nsaddles her with the burden of semi-omniscient narration that\u2019s rife with\r\nplatitudinous nonsense (\u201cIt was time for the Krays to enter the secret history\r\nof the 1960s\u201d and \u201cNot even Scotland Yard could ignore murder on the street,\u201d\r\nthe latter of which has the uncomfortable echo of the bit in the Piranha\r\nBrothers sketch wherein the gangsters detonate a nuclear device over London).\r\nSecond, he gives her onscreen character hardly any more depth than any of the\r\ncomplaining gangster and/or undercover cop wives you\u2019ve seen in dozens of crime\r\npictures over the years, Emily Browning\u2019s committed performance\r\nnotwithstanding. Which makes Helgeland\u2019s final trick with this character all\r\nthe more objectionable when he finally pulls it. I knew a bit about the case of\r\nthe Krays before coming in to the screening of the picture, but that knowledge\r\nwasn\u2019t at the forefront of my consciousness as I watched the movie. And then I\r\nthought \u2026 wait a minute. And sure enough \u2026  Advertisement Spoiler alert: Reginald Kray\u2019s real-life first wife, Frances\r\nShea, committed suicide in 1967, two years after marrying Kray. And this is\r\nindeed depicted in the last fifth of the film, complete with\r\nFrances-as-narrator playing a little bit of \u201cgotcha\u201d with the audience. It\r\nstrikes me as both aesthetically cheap and morally dubious to make an actual\r\nsuicide into your own Joe Gillis for the sake of \u2026 well, that\u2019s the other thing,\r\nwhich is I don\u2019t know what \u201cLegend\u201d was made in the sake of.

{"Title": "The Water Diviner", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Russell Crowe's directorial debut \"The Water Diviner,\" about a man trying to find \r\nthree sons who disappeared at the battle of Gallipoli in Turkey 100 years ago, is a film divided against itself. It wants to be both a \r\nmournful and skeptical antiwar picture and a rousing adventure with splashes of buddy comedy, romance and borderline swashbuckling. Crowe, who also stars as widowed hero Joshua Connor, is of course a terrific action hero, quite convincing as a 19th century man, or our romanticized ideal of such a man. But this isn't the sort of film that ought to have a character like Connor at its center, because Crowe's undeniable magnetism (showcased with confidence by Crowe the filmmaker) pushes against the film's other reason for being: to doubt and question he-man myths.  Advertisement At one point, the hero confesses that he bears some \r\nresponsibility for his son's fates, because \"I did fill their heads with\r\n heroic nonsense: God and King and Country\"\u2014an astonishingly brave admission, coming \r\nfrom a man whose wife Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie) killed herself because she couldn't bear the loss of three boys; but like other such moments, this one falls flat because \"The Water Diviner\" is filled \r\nwith the same \"heroic nonsense\" that Connor decries. To watch \"The Water Diviner\" is to be urged to break ourselves of our addiction to imagery that the film we're watching can't resist. Every time Andrew Knight and\u00a0Andrew Anastasios' screenplay warns its characters and the viewer against buying the notion that war is a test of mettle\u2014an activity that turns boys into men and shrouds them in glory whether they survive or not\u2014it follows up with a scene of Connor digging a well all by himself, brawling with four Turks in an alley, eluding would-be captors by climbing across rooftops, galloping into the film's climax astride a noble steed, or otherwise carrying on like John Wayne in God's Humble Gift mode. The film's fuzzy mystical undertones are irksome as well. They seem\r\n less aligned with 19th century representations of Christian or Muslim \r\nspirituality than with fond childhood memories of \"Star Wars.\" Connor \r\nfinds his answers in Turkey the same way he finds water back home in the\r\n Australian desert, by closing his eyes and feeling The Force flowing \r\nthrough him, and he often sees long, detailed, real-time flashbacks to \r\nevents that only God could reveal in such detail. This feels less like\r\n a pop visualization of the oneness of humanity (of the sort that Crowe's compatriot Peter Weir managed in so many great films, including \"Gallipoli\" and the Crowe vehicle \"Master and Commander\") than a storytelling shortcut. The film's sense of history and politics is a muddle as well. That would be less troubling if \"The Water Diviner\" had come out five or 10 years ago, and at some other time of year; but it's being released internationally one hundred years to the day that Australian and New Zealand Army Corps landed at Gallipoli and joined a bloody campaign that stretched from April of 1915 through January of 1916. This seems like one of the biggest tactical errors in film release history when you think about how \"The Water Diviner\" treats the the specific horrors of this chapter of World War I: as a backdrop for a tale of a sad-eyed white Australian healing himself in a foreign land. He shows up a rules-obsessed British officer (Dan Wyllie) who tries to keep him away from the battlefield, enjoys a rejuvenating (though thankfully chaste) romance with a widowed Turkish woman half his age (Olga Kurylenko's Ayshe), and becomes a surrogate dad to her adorable son Orhan (Dylan Georgiades).\u00a0  Advertisement All told, 205,000 British, 47,000 French and 251,000 Turkish soldiers \r\ndied in combat or from illnesses during the Gallipoli campaign; about 8,700 of Britain's losses were \r\nfrom ANZAC forces. The Armenian genocide\u2014which began on the same day that ANZAC forces landed\u2014is never mentioned. That all this should serve mainly as backdrop to a brawny man's journey of heroic healing, with its echoes of \"Dances with Wolves\" by way of \"The Quiet Man,\" makes the closing dedication to wartime dead seem tone-deaf. The film attains a properly incredulous horror in flashbacks to the ordeal of Connor's sons' (Ryan Corr, Ben O'Toole and James Fraser), which are marked by gore, tears and moans, and in scenes of ANZAC and Turkish soldiers being raked by machine gun fire, gutted with bayonets, and pulped by land mines and artillery. But here, too, \"The Water Diviner\" seems conflicted. Crowe's staging of violence alternates between detached scrutiny of unforgivable suffering and a video-game amazement at the harm weapons inflict on flesh. The film enfolds many conflicts within its handsome widescreen canvas\u2014East vs. West; \r\nthe Ottoman Empire vs. the British Empire; the Greeks vs. the Turks\u2014but \r\nthese all take a backseat to the\r\nstruggle between \"War is hell\" and \"War is awesome.\" The battle ends in \r\nstalemate.

{"Title": "Serena", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have brought such\r\nenergy and chemistry to their relationships in their scenes together in \u201cSilver\r\nLinings Playbook\u201d and \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d that viewers may be tempted to give\r\ntheir latest collaboration some attention despite the stories of\r\npost-production drama and bad buzz that has accompanied it. I certainly\r\napproached it with an It Can\u2019t Be THAT\r\nBad attitude, largely due to my admiration for its stars, but also because I\u2019ve\r\nrespected director Susanne Bier\u2019s work in the past (particularly \u201cBrothers\u201d and\r\n\u201cAfter the Wedding\u201d). Ten minutes in, one can tell something is wrong with \u201cSerena\u201d.\r\nBy the misguided ending, it\u2019s a flat-out disaster, the kind of film that its\r\ncast and crew hope gets buried as quickly as possible as they race to move on\r\nto other projects. Given the fact that it was filmed almost three years ago,\r\nCooper and Lawrence have likely forgotten they made it by now. Follow their\r\nlead. Advertisement It is Depression-era North Carolina and George Pemberton\r\n(Cooper) seems to be one of the few successful businessmen in his mountainous\r\nregion, running a flourishing timber empire. With the assistance of a business\r\npartner named Buchanan (David Dencik) and a spiritually-guided hunter named\r\nGalloway (Rhys Ifans), the Pemberton name is becoming well-known, although the\r\nlocal Sheriff (Toby Jones) suspects something is afoot. Into this empire falls\r\na Lady MacBeth in the form of Serena Shaw (Jennifer Lawrence), who quickly\r\nbecomes Serena Pemberton (over such memorable lines as \u201cI think we should be married.\u201d Smile. End scene.) Serena rubs everyone but George the wrong way. She barges\r\ninto the lumber company ordering people around and accusing them of doing six\r\nmonths of work in nine months. She is clearly designed as a force of change,\r\nfirst feeling competition for George\u2019s business from Buchanan and then feeling competition\r\nfor his legacy from a townswoman who happens to be the mother to George\u2019s\r\nillegitimate child. But Serena, despite Lawrence\u2019s best efforts isn\u2019t a\r\ncharacter. She has melodramatic emotions and plot twists forced upon her with\r\nno depth or thematic resonance to any of it. She bends to the will of a\r\nmanipulative narrative as if no one ever paused to answer questions of motive\r\nor back story for this character. Why does she feel so strongly for George? Why\r\ndoes she take center stage in one scene but pull back in another? She is\r\nmaddeningly inconsistent, and so the film has a thematic vacuum in the middle\r\nof its narrative. Who is the title character and why do we care about her should\r\nbe two of the first questions asked when crafting a screenplay like \u201cSerena\u201d.\r\nThey never were here. It doesn\u2019t help that Bier finds a way to over-direct and\r\nunder-direct in alternately frustrating manners. The first act is filled with\r\nan overuse of score, gauzy camerawork and slow-mo montages of people riding\r\nhorseback and making love by candlelight. But as the narrative gets darker and\r\ndeath enters this little world, Bier loses the romantic, old-fashioned\r\nfilmmaking style, and the entire affair just becomes dour and depressing, which\r\nis all the more startling given the two typically-vibrant actors who star in\r\nit. None of it feels organic, genuine, or even moderately entertaining. It is a\r\nfilm in which performers and crew go through the motions in such a way that one\r\ncan sense that they knew, long before production wrapped, that something was\r\nwrong.

{"Title": "Delirium", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Fun fact: this movie has been kicking around since 2014, when it played the Carmel International Film Festival under the title \u201cCase #13.\u201d As of this writing (January 15, 2018), \u201cCase #13\u201d and \u201cDelirium\u201d are listed as two separate movies in the IMDb directorial filmography of Johnny Martin, a longtime stuntperson and actor who made his feature directorial debut with this picture. Even if it had actually been released in 2014 (the sole showing, according to the IMDb, was at the Carmel International Film Festival that year), \u201cDelirium\u201d would have felt at least a trifle dated. The opening scene sets up a large portion of the premise: subjective camera in the mode of a million other found-footage horror movies. And of course it\u2019s nighttime. And of course there are a bunch of bros with flashlights. Running. Towards something. Being chased maybe. But they\u2019re somewhere they\u2019re not supposed to be. And there\u2019s an abandoned swimming pool that\u2019s pretty funky. And a red rubber ball that comes from out of nowhere. And a little girl sitting in the corner of the of the pool away from one of the bros. Will her face be bloodied, or horribly scarred, or in some other way misshapen, when she turns to face the bro? Of course it will be.\u00a0 Advertisement Written by Andy Cheng and Lisa Clemens from a story \u201cby\u201d Martin (I put quotes around that word because given how much blatant borrowing this scenarios does from \u201cThe Shining\u201d and other horror classics or near-classics, the scenario is more a collage than an original creation), \u201cDelirium\u201d then goes back in time and unsuccessfully attempts to differentiate the bro characters and give them a sense of mission. The bros, a self-described \u201cHell Gang,\u201d are initiating a new member, and there\u2019s a dare involved. Get to the porch of a deserted mansion where a crazed doctor murdered more than a dozen of his own children, and stand at its porch in the dead of night. Chronicling the whole thing on video will be Chase, and most of the movie is told from his camera\u2019s point of view.\u00a0 The action proceeds in what I came to see as movements; first there is the \u201cWhat happened to Eddie\u201d one, in which the Hell Gang start worrying about Eddie, the initiate who seems to have gotten to said porch but hasn\u2019t come back. Then there\u2019s the \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Chase\u201d movement, in which Chase, nerdy-intellectual of the group (I guess, given his glasses) seems possessed despite his deep knowledge of the grisly events that took place in the house the Hell Gang have broken into in search of Eddie. Then there\u2019s the \u201cNo, Muzo\u201d movement, in which the boys tell the jock, Muzo, \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0 Various ghosts and ghouls enter the shots at times, and there\u2019s even a naked seductive girl ghost (and yes, she is introduced in a manner that recalls \u201cThe Shining\u201d). In spite of creating a mental atmosphere of mildly irritated indifference in this viewer, the movie has some real filmmaking talent behind it. Director Martin has a way with a camera, and in cutting between the \u201cfound\u201d footage stuff and an ostensibly objective camera within scenes he creates some unusual rhythms that would, I think, have yielded genuine suspense had they involved characters that weren\u2019t complete yawns. Had this been the work of a young novice filmmaker, I would say it showed some promise. But as it happens, Mr. Martin is approaching his mid-fifties. He should look for better writers, to begin with.

{"Title": "The Fate of the Furious", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Riding the success of \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d director F. Gary Gray jumps into one of the most successful franchises of all time with \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d the eighth\u00a0installment in a series that seems increasingly critic-proof. How big are these movies? They have made almost $4 billion worldwide, with the last one shattering the previous series record, bringing in $1.5 billion on its own. There are big franchises and then there\u2019s \u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d movies, which have found the perfect blend of international appeal, ridiculous action and, of course, an emphasis on \u201cfamily,\u201d whatever that word means to you. Regardless of reviews, this series is too big to fail. It\u2019s going to be around for a very long time. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be disappointed that \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d distinctly drops the level of quality in this series for the first time this decade. Advertisement With a series that has been this wide-ranging in terms of critical appeal, it feels like a declaration of taste is appropriate. I didn\u2019t care much about the films at all until \u201cFast Five\u201d although I agreed that \u201cThe Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\u201d took more risks and was more fun than the awful second (\"2 Fast 2 Furious\") and possibly-worst fourth film (\"Fast & Furious\"). It took five movies to figure out the franchise, turning them into roller coasters that alternated between cartoonish action set pieces and heartfelt conversations about makeshift families. They seemed like the answer to \u201cWhat if we made the entire movie like those insane opening bits from the Bond movies? Plus family.\u201d And the series only got better with the inclusion of new faces like Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Kurt Russell. Yes, they\u2019re ridiculous\u2014but that\u2019s also why they\u2019re fun.  So, why isn\u2019t \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d more fun? That\u2019s going to be the question to which you keep returning as you watch all 136 minutes of this film that\u2019s relatively enjoyable when compared to other hollow blockbusters but relatively disappointing when compared to the high points of this series. First and foremost, it\u2019s a movie that\u2019s over two hours long and has almost no plot. Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) betrays his team after being forced to work against them by a Bond-esque supervillain named Cipher (Charlize Theron). They work to stop him and get him back in their \u201cfamily.\u201d That\u2019s about it. Throughout, almost everyone gets one-and-a-half emotions. Michelle Rodriguez does the most she can with her blend of confusion and love for the man that may be trying to kill her now. Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson do a lot with their characters' rivalry, even it feels more like a Shane Black \u201880s action comedy than this series ever has before. Even the settings seem thin in terms of writing. The action jumps around the globe in a way that looks calculated for international appeal more than any real use of location. I picture a whiteboard in the writers room that says \u201cCuba=Hot, Russia=Cold.\u201d And while it\u2019s become something of a joke to say that these films are all about \u201cfamily,\u201d it really functions like a crutch here. They use the word over a dozen times, almost as if it\u2019s the fallback when they couldn\u2019t think of anything else plot-wise to link the action sequences. And here\u2019s where the defenders of the Furious Flame kick in with the chorus that plot doesn\u2019t matter to these films. It\u2019s all about adrenaline, and no one cares that the filmmakers forgot to give at least half the characters anything memorable to do this time around. And there are times when \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d bursts into escapist lunacy in which it\u2019s easy to agree. The \u201cbig\u201d sequences work, especially a bit with a wave of hacked self-driving cars in New York City and the climactic chaos in Russia that almost feels like it\u2019s mocking the \u201clongest runway in the world\u201d sequence from \u201cFast & Furious 6\u201d in terms of MPH inconsistency. When \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d gives viewers what they\u2019re really paying that ticket price to see, there\u2019s an undeniably goofy, playful, fun time to be had. It\u2019s all the other stuff that starts to really annoy. Advertisement This failing in the material that connects the action sequences is never more prominent than when Charlize Theron is on screen. \"The Fate of the Furious\" will go down as one of the largest wastes of a major talent in a blockbuster film in years. Likely cast because of how much ass she kicked in \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d writer Chris Morgan then neglects to give Theron a single notable action sequence. She\u2019s stuck on a high-tech plane, issuing orders to other people on the ground below. How on Earth do you bring in Imperator Furiosa and not make her race against Dom Toretto? She has one interesting sequence early in the movie, in which she and \u201cEvil Dom\u201d overtake the team, which makes the rest of her arc feel like even more of a disappointment because one sees what she could have done. There\u2019s no heat to this character whatsoever\u2014no physicality, no sexuality, no passion. We don\u2019t even really know why she\u2019s doing what she\u2019s doing, and you can actually see Theron start to get bored. This franchise has always had a villain problem\u2014although it\u2019s increasingly interesting that every villain eventually becomes a hero\u2014but this seems like the biggest misfire, not only in terms of wasted opportunity but how much time Theron is forced to deliver dull, useless exposition. It\u2019s tempting to blame the relative failures of this movie on the loss of the underrated Paul Walker or the new director. The action scenes are well-done, but the rest is surprisingly dull given what Gray has delivered in the past, leading one to believe he was purely for hire. The spectacle works. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve come to expect. I suspect it will continue to work for a few more films. But if they\u2019re going to rise to the entertainment level they\u2019ve hit before, this series needs someone behind the wheel who can make those narrative valleys between the peaks of the roller coaster ride more memorable. Find a writer who can write more interesting dialogue. Find a director who can add visual flair when cars aren\u2019t going boom. Give your increasingly gigantic supporting cast something to do. Of course, none of this will hold \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d back from box office glory. At this point, the destination is predetermined\u2014it's the journey to it that's getting exhausting.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Valley of Love", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert first appeared\r\nonscreen together in 1974\u2019s \u201cGoing Places,\u201d a still-coruscating, anti-buddy sex\r\ncomedy directed by the currently out-of-favor-in-cinephile-land director Bertrand Blier.\r\nHuppert played Jacqueline, a rebellious teen who loses her virginity under\r\nproblematic circumstances to the two louts played by Depardieu and Patrick\r\nDewaere. Isabelle and Gerard were then the romantic leads in\r\nMaurice Pialat\u2019s 1980 \u201cLoulou,\u201d in which Huppert played a young woman who flips\r\noff her nasty abusive husband and her bourgeois social set to pursue erotic\r\nrapture with Depardieu\u2019s titular hunk (who exudes a Joe-Dallesandro-gone-Gallic\r\nallure). That movie was a kind of erotic landmark of ostensibly mainstream\r\nmoviemaking, in part because of Huppert and Depardieu\u2019s candor and lack of\r\ninhibition. The performers continue to exhibit those qualities forty years\r\nafter the fact, reuniting in the evocative, sometimes puzzling, and sometimes\r\nmoving \u201cValley of Love.\u201d Advertisement This is the latest film from Guillaume Nicloux, who recently\r\nmade \u201cThe Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq,\u201d in which the French literary former\r\nenfant terrible played himself in a fictional scenario. Initially, \u201cValley of\r\nLove\u201d also seems occupied with meta activities; the lead actors play characters\r\nnamed \u201cG\u00e9rard\u201d and \u201cIsabelle.\u201d But\u2014and it\u2019s a substantial \"but\"\u2014their characters\r\nare a former married couple, one with an adult son that committed suicide.\r\nThat\u2019s not true of Huppert and Depardieu, despite the fact that their\r\ncharacters, meeting in the USA's own Death Valley after years of\r\nestrangement, are also film performers. Depardieu\u2019s jape of honoring a pesky\r\nAmerican\u2019s autograph request by signing \u201cBob De Niro\u201d leads to some interesting\r\ndiscomfort for him. Obviously, Nicloux got these performers back together to\r\nextrapolate on, or perhaps exploit, their iconography, but he\u2019s up to quite a\r\nbit more than that.  The dead son has, in separate but very nearly verbatim\r\nletters, asked G\u00e9rard and Isabelle to meet for seven days at Death Valley\u2019s\r\npark; at the end of their stay, he promises, he will appear to them. G\u00e9rard has\r\nacquiesced reluctantly; he\u2019s got health issues weighing on his mind. (While\r\nHuppert, now over 60, still looks sensational, the sight of the gargantuan\r\nDepardieu with his shirt off, suntan or not, somehow brings to mind Fredric\r\nForrest\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d monologue about the boiled sides of beef.) Isabelle\r\nbelieves that the manifestation will occur, and implores Gerard to stay and\r\nhave faith. And that\u2019s the film\u2019s operating mechanism; the rest of \u201cValley of\r\nLove\u201d consists of the performers/characters\u2019 sometimes pained, sometimes wryly\r\nfunny interactions. Both G\u00e9rard and Isabelle deal with forms of individual\r\nanxiety (this being a European art film, the scene in which one of them vomits\r\nfeels a little pro forma), and Nicloux throws in more intimations of the\r\nsupernatural as the promised day draws closer. The Death Valley vistas are\r\noften spectacular, the melancholic, dissonant music of Charles Ives is aptly\r\nused, and Depardieu and Huppert resonate mightily even when they\u2019re not up to\r\nmuch. It\u2019s a little jarring to see these two one-time emblems of rebellion in\r\nthe roles of aged parents who just didn\u2019t understand, but of course that\u2019s part\r\nof the film\u2019s point. Youthful impudence is a great and sometimes useful thing,\r\nbut it is, alas, practically unsustainable, which is something we never quite\r\nget while we\u2019re exercising it. These characters, and the actors playing them,\r\nget it very, very well. It\u2019s in the way that Depardieu and Huppert can convey\r\nan aspect of phenomenological rue that gives this sometimes muddled movie its\r\nultimate value.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Faith of Our Fathers", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"Faith of Our Fathers,\" the latest Christian-themed film from the studio that produced \"God's Not Dead\" and \"Do You Believe?\", tells the story of two men whose fathers fought in Vietnam and never came back. The two mismatched guys, one a domesticated Christian yuppie, the other a rough sullen non-believer, team up to go on a road trip to Washington D.C. to visit the Vietnam Memorial and find their fathers' names. Over the course of the improvisational trip, they butt heads, they open up, and the \"faith of their fathers,\" revealed slowly over the course of the film though the surviving letters written home from Vietnam, opens their eyes to redemption, grace and faith.  Advertisement \"Faith of Our Fathers\" doesn't work, and not because of its Christian message. The main problems are the obvious script (every plot-twist can be seen coming from miles down the road), the bad acting, and the cheaply-done, unconvincing Vietnam flashbacks. Director Carey Scott (who wrote the script with lead actors Kevin Downes and David A.R. White) seems to hope the message will be enough. It's not. Kevin Downes plays \"John Paul George.\" His Beatles-inspired three first names are used as a joke in almost every scene. He's a good Christian guy, engaged to to Cynthia, a cheerful woman (Candace Cameron Bure) who's busy planning their wedding and practicing cooking meals for her husband-to-be. At Cynthia's suggestion, he sets out to find a guy named Wayne, the son of the man his dad befriended in Vietnam. Landed in Mississippi, he finds Wayne living holed up in a hillbilly shack, eating food he shot himself and grumpy about everything. (Notice that their two first names add up to \"John Wayne.\" Subtle, this film is not.)\u00a0 John and Wayne have a bumpy beginning. Wayne has a bunch of letters from his dad in his possession that mention John's dad, but he refuses to hand them over. He demands payment for each one. He blusters and grunts and chews Twizzlers and chomps on a toothpick, and it's a performance full of broad indicating that calls to mind James Dean's advice to a young Dennis Hopper: During the filming of \"Rebel Without a Cause,\" Hopper was so impressed by Dean that he started imitating Dean's mannerisms. Dean noticed, and pulled Hopper aside, saying, \"If you're going to smoke a cigarette onscreen, just smoke the cigarette. Don't act like you're smoking the cigarette.\" David A.R. White is very busy acting like he's chewing on Twizzlers, acting like he's doing everything. The character is a grotesque stereotype, but we soon learn of his pain and angst in a later scene, during the only good-looking shot in the whole film, the two men sitting in adjoining jail cells with golden light streaming in through the bars. The impromptu road trip to D.C. is interspersed with flashbacks to Vietnam, showing their fathers becoming friends in the rainy \"jungle\" of 1969. Half of the time, the sun is clearly shining and there's fake rain coming down in the foreground. Dry-ice fog billows at night. Adding to the lack of verisimilitude is that we see these two men writing letters home on tiny scraps of paper with smudgy wet pencils all as the rain pours down on the paper, but back in the present, the letters the men read are all written on pristine loose-leaf paper that looks like it was torn out of a notebook yesterday. Details like this are not irrelevant. They matter.\u00a0 Advertisement In Vietnam, John's dad Steven (Sean McGowan) and Wayne's dad Eddie (Scott Whyte) form a bond. Steven reads his Bible all the time and the other soldiers rib him about it. His sergeant (Stephen Baldwin) scolds Eddie for talking about death and Heaven and the afterlife to the soldiers who should be focused on staying alive. Shades of the Christian persecution complex. Eddie is cynical, but drawn to Steven's strength and peace, and wonders if he's missing out on something. To give credit where it's due, both actors do a very convincing job in their scenes, bringing forth a believable sense of the fear and disorientation that comes with combat (especially when the confused commanders seem to be setting them up to fail.) Their scenes feature the strongest proselytizing message in the film, with Steven telling Eddie about Jesus and the Bible, but the actors \"bring it\" in a sincere and open way. Again, it's not the message that is the problem, ultimately. It's how it's delivered. \u00a0 The wacky buddy road movie sections are strained and false, featuring many gigantic closeups of the men in the car behaving and reacting in broad ways to one another, and green-screen roads stretching out through the rear window (with a couple of scenes showing what is obviously the same stretch of road). Along the way, they have adventures, they pick up hitchhikers, get into fights with rednecks and accidentally buy a stolen car. Meanwhile, nag-Cynthia puts in increasingly threatening calls to John about leaving her, even though she was the one who suggested he find Wayne in the first place.\u00a0 Many great films have explored Christian themes. There were the Biblical epics like D.W. Griffith's \"Intolerance,\" or \"Ben Hur\" and \"The Ten Commandments.\" More recently, there was the smash-hit of Mel Gibson's visceral \"The Passion of the Christ.\" These films brought forward an explicit Christian message and did so with panache and scope, not to mention artistic seriousness. There is no excuse for a film with Christian themes to slack off artistically, considering those examples. More recently, there was \"Calvary,\" with its story of redemption and sin in one small Irish town, or last year's Oscar-winning foreign film \"Ida,\" which took issues of faith and devotion seriously, backdropped by ghosts of the Holocaust. Early this year came \"Against the Sun,\"\u00a0a true story about three WWII pilots stranded in a life-raft in the Pacific. It had a Christian message about strong faith in difficult times, and it was a well-done film. \"Selma\" showed how the faith of the civil rights leaders helped them stay strong in dangerous times, with African-American churches calling on their long history of protest and resistance. \"Selma\" did not condescend to the faithful, belittle them, or mock them. These are all serious films. But the lightweight Christian films, films like \"Kirk Cameron Saves Christmas,\" or last year's dreadful \"The Identical,\"\u00a0or \"Faith of Our Fathers\", prioritize the message in ways that are amateurish and obvious.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Sweet Micky for President", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "At a sparsely attended 2010 press conference in Montreal, pop star Michel Martelly (aka \"Sweet\u00a0Micky\") announced his candidacy for President of Haiti. One of the reporters asked why he would want such a job: \"It would be like wanting to be the Captain of the Titanic.\" Haiti was still in a state of disaster following the 7.0-magnitude earthquake on\u00a0January 12th\u00a0of the same year. The country had been roiled by dictatorships, military coups and political chaos for most of the 20th century. But Martelly thought he could provide some hope. And so began one of the strangest, funniest, and most exciting political races in recent history. The story of Martelly's unlikely and rambunctious campaign is the subject of Ben Patterson's entertaining documentary \"Sweet\u00a0Micky\u00a0for President.\" This film captures the\u00a0feeling of that campaign, with constant seesawing between raucous concerts and political pow-wows. It also manages to be an honest portrait of Haiti's challenges and a wary celebration of the mess of the democratic process. Advertisement Michel Martelly, now the President of Haiti (no spoiler there), was a gigantic pop star whose onstage shenanigans were a blend of Miley Cyrus, Jim Morrison, Michael Jackson and Madonna. A provocative controversial bald goofball, he wore diapers or mini skirts onstage wiggling his ass, he pulled down his pants and grabbed his crotch. But his sexually explicit onstage persona was a smokescreen for his angry and political lyrics directed towards the National Palace inhabited by one corrupt dictator after another. After the regimes of Francois \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier, Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, with coups in between, the Haiti people were fed up. The Haitian diaspora looked on helplessly. A famous American of Haitian descent, Pras Michel of The Fugees, wanted to do something, so he suggested that \"Sweet\u00a0Micky\" throw his hat into the ring.\u00a0To put it mildly, Martelly started out with no political platform. Martelly and Pras Michel were just two guys traveling around talking in villages. At one point, Pras Michel, who narrates the film through on-camera interviews, admits, \"I realized we didn't have a plan.\" So they hired a slick campaign manager, and suddenly there was a tour bus, posters, T-shirts. (The campaign manager admits that he had to remind \"Sweet\u00a0Micky\" before every event: \"This is not a concert. This is a political rally.\")Interspersed with all of this activity are reminders of Haiti's past, starting with the world-changing slave revolution that erupted in 1791 and lasted until 1804. The Haitians drove out the Spanish, drove out the British, drove out Napoleon's France. The post-independence period was fractious, involving emigration, massacres of whites and political turmoil. But Haiti was the first free black nation in the post-colonial era. Using old paintings and photographs, and narrated by Haitian historians and political activists, that timeline emerges clearly and creatively. Stately circling aerial shots of the capital Port-au-Prince, the famous Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re, the mass grave at Titanyen, the countryside and tent cities act as chapter markers, underscored with jaunty show-bizzy music by Paul Brill. The music gives the film an absurd and humorous tone, even with footage of street violence, rolling tanks, confrontations between the military and the people. Despite that tone, \"Sweet\u00a0Micky\" is not cynical or condescending. It's very loving towards Haiti, and presents participation as part of the contract between leader and people. \"Sweet\u00a0Micky\" admits (and revels in) the absurdity of a guy who wiggled onstage in a diaper just the year before now circulating at cocktail parties in a suit and elegant spectacles. Martelly speaks of his plans for Haiti (soil cultivation, tourism, wind farms), and those looking on seem to think, \"How, though, how will you make all that happen,\u00a0Sweet\u00a0Micky?\" One Haitian-American says bluntly to the camera, \"He cannot run Haiti.\"The campaign got even more outrageous when Wyclef, another member of The Fugees, entered the presidential race, causing flurries of alarm and betrayal in\u00a0Sweet\u00a0Micky's ranks, especially since Wyclef had larger financial resources. So suddenly Haiti had two famous music stars gunning for the presidency. But other candidates rose: Jude C\u00e9lestin, son-in-law of Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, political veteran Mirlande Manigat whose campaign slogan was \"Give Me My Mommy,\" and then, two days before the election, Aristide himself returned from exile, with crowds erupting into a frenzy of adulation, people screaming into the camera, \"My Dad is back! My King is back!\" Poll-watchers streamed into Haiti to oversee the voting process, keeping an eye out for fraud and voter intimidation.The backstage scenes are almost as entertaining as the mayhem of the campaign. There's Pras Michel and\u00a0Sweet\u00a0Micky, political newbies, having a whispered t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate in a hotel conference room. There's Pras Michel making inflammatory comments on a Haitian talk show, threatening that people's heads would be cut off if\u00a0Sweet\u00a0Micky\u00a0lost. Banned from events because of that, Pras Michel is shown sadly looking at his cellphone alone in a hotel room while Sweet\u00a0Micky\u00a0bounds onstage in front of thousands. American celebrities get involved. Sean Penn, whose work in Haiti following the earthquake has been admirable, comes off as a red-faced blowhard, stating pompously at a Hollywood event, \"As an NGO leader, it is not my place to interfere with elections ...\" He then proceeds to interfere with the election. Campaign meetings are held at B.B. King's nightclub. Wyclef, in a huge fur coat, joins\u00a0Sweet\u00a0Micky\u00a0in a stretch limo to hammer out a compromise. If political engagement and hope still matters (and it does) then there is something extremely touching, really, about all of this. Political naivet\u00e9 can be dangerous. John Lennon's \"Imagine\" is potentially terrifying if one \"imagines\" it put into practice. But political naivet\u00e9 can also be beautiful. Cracks in the edifice of established power allow for new ideas, energy, a fresh start.\u00a0Sweet\u00a0Micky\u00a0knew what he represented to the people and positioned himself as the candidate for change. \"Sweet\u00a0Micky\u00a0for President\" shows Martelly's steep learning-curve about political realities as well as his growing sense of confidence and commitment. It's inspiring.\u00a0Similar to Camilla Nielsson' new documentary \"Democrats\" that shows two political rivals in Zimbabwe coming together to create a constitution under the shadow of long-time leader Robert Mugabe, \"Sweet\u00a0Micky\u00a0for President\" shows the fragile and sometimes-tentative steps towards democracy in an exhausted angry nation where people have had enough of the corrupt tyrannical old guard.\u00a0Why not a guy who spent the majority of his life gyrating onstage in a diaper as President? Why not indeed?", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Bad Turn Worse", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cBad Turn Worse\u201d joins a long line of movies about people\r\nwho stayed in dangerous, desperate places just a little too long (it was\r\noriginally called \u201cWe Gotta Get Out of This Place\u201d). Simon and Zeke Hawkins\u2019\r\nconfident thriller opens by name-checking Jim Thompson, and proceeds to tell a\r\ntale that Thompson himself would have admired in its duplicitous simplicity.\r\nWith its constant state of twilight lighting, cinematography that somehow\r\nconveys what feels like oppressive heat, and characters stuck in criminal\r\nquicksand, \u201cBad Turn Worse\u201d actually earns that Thompson comparison at its\r\nbest. It\u2019s a confident, engaging film, undone by some narrative sag in the\r\nmiddle but worth seeing for its opening and closing acts. Advertisement Bobby (Jeremy Allen White of \u201cShameless\u201d) and Sue (Mackenzie\r\nDavis of \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d) are leaving the podunk town in which they\u2019ve\r\ngrown up in Middle of Nowhere, Texas. They\u2019re going to college, leaving behind\r\nSue\u2019s lunk of a boyfriend B.J. (Logan Huffman). On one of their last nights\r\ntogether, B.J. decides that the trio should go out in style. He bankrolls the\r\npartying by robbing the safe of his moronic boss Giff (Mark Pellegrino), after\r\nfiguring out that everything, from his pin number to the combination in his\r\noffice, is based on a variation of his favorite number: 69. B.J. is the kind of\r\ntestosterone-heavy man-child who doesn\u2019t think before he acts and seriously\r\nunderestimates the malevolence in the heart of his employer. Bobby and B.J. come in the next day to work to find Giff\r\nrepeatedly kicking the Mexican employee that he thinks robbed him. To try and\r\nstop the violence, Bobby announces that he took the money, protecting B.J. and,\r\nfoolishly, thinking he can now make things right. Giff tells Bobby that in\r\norder to repay him, he\u2019ll have to do a job, an even bigger robbery of a crime\r\nlord named Big Red, who launders money through Giff\u2019s place of business. Of course, this can\u2019t\r\npossibly end well.  \u201cBad Turn Worse\u201d is a story in which the dread comes from\r\nwell-defined feelings like desperation and jealousy. B.J. lashes out at the two\r\nfriends leaving him behind in this desolate Texas landscape with nothing but\r\nthe inevitable path to his asshole employer\u2019s life. B.J. becomes Giff becomes\r\nBig Red. It\u2019s the circle of criminal life. Dutch Southern\u2019s script works\r\nbecause we can feel the emotion behind B.J.\u2019s lashing out at the two people leaving him behind.\r\nAs played by Huffman, B.J. is the kind of kid who figured out a long time ago that Bobby and Sue are smarter than him, and\r\nlikely headed to lives that will leave him behind. Therefore, his violent\r\nstupidity feels organic to the emotion of his character and not merely a plot\r\ndevice as in so many lesser indie thrillers. Huffman\u2019s performance is balanced by those by White, Davis\r\nand Pellegrino. The young star of \u201cShameless\u201d has a face that Thompson would\r\nhave loved\u2014all sunken, sleepy eyes that disguise a mind that\u2019s always\r\ndeciphering what to do next. Davis is a future star, so charismatic on the AMC\r\nhit and well-cast here as the girl who outgrew her small town upbringing\r\nthrough literature and intellectual exploration. She needed to get outta this\r\nplace a long time ago. And Pellegrino is fantastic here, truly disturbing in\r\nhis gleeful propensity for violence. Advertisement \u201cBad Turn Worse\u201d starts off with such energy\u2014I wanted more\r\ndialogue-driven scenes like the opening diner bit about Thompson and whether or\r\nnot it should be called \u201cBacon & Egg\u201d instead of the plural if you only\r\nhave one egg\u2014that it\u2019s bound to sag a bit when the robbery plotting kicks in.\r\nIt often feels like the trio is too often discussing the intricacies of the\r\nplot when more character development would have helped. The Hawkins regain the\r\nfilm\u2019s energy in a disturbing scene that reveals the depth of Giff\u2019s insanity\r\nand in the final scenes of inevitable double and triple crosses.

{"Title": "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Anger is an energy in Martin McDonagh\u2019s brilliant \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d one of the best films of the year. In this \u201cSouthern American with an Irish attitude\u201d story from the \"In Bruges\" writer/director that, like a lot of his work, recalls Flannery O\u2019Connor in tone (the O'Connor quote \"The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it\" could be this movie's tagline), anger is not treated like something to be cured. Hollywood likes to teach us that anger is a sin, and that only through acceptance and understanding can we find true happiness. Easier said than done, right? How can you not be angry at an unfair world? Life will take children before parents. Life will give cancer to relatively young people. Life will be racist, sexist, and cruel. And you should throw a few back and yell at something that unfair. You should fight. It is only through that fighting and that rage that other emotions like empathy and understanding can surface. Anger is not a disease to be cured but a path on the road to comprehending the world. Advertisement No one does angry better than Frances McDormand, who does her best film work here since \u201cFargo\u201d as Mildred Hayes, a recently divorced mother who lost her daughter Angela less than a year ago. Angela was raped and murdered, but the case has gone cold. There was no matching DNA, so the spotlight has dimmed and Mildred is getting no updates. She\u2019s angry. She should be. One day, she sees three barren billboards on a rarely-traveled road, and she rents the space to ask the local chief of police, played by Woody Harrelson, why there are no answers. Local media becomes interested in the billboards, and the attention sparks a series of events involving not only the chief but one of his more loathsome officers, played by Sam Rockwell. Peter Dinklage, Caleb Landry Jones, Abbie Cornish, Lucas Hedges, Clarke Peters, and John Hawkes fill out a ridiculously perfect supporting cast. You might think you have your finger on what this will be like from that description, but McDonagh\u2019s simply perfect script is never quite what you expect it to be. The mystery of what happened to Angela would have dominated other versions of this story, but this is not really that movie. On one level, it is more about cause and effect than crime and resolution. Mildred rents the billboards, which leads to pressure on the chief, which leads to anger from his loyal officer, and so on and so on down the line. McDonagh spares no one, allowing almost all of his characters to be deeply flawed, especially McDormand\u2019s Mildred and Rockwell\u2019s Dixon. Life has screwed over both of these people, and it has made them both angry. Mildred is channeling her anger to solve her daughter\u2019s murder. Dixon has less of an idea of what to do with his, but one senses early on that it\u2019s probably going to eventually cost him his job. Rockwell often plays nice guys, but he\u2019s more effective here as a racist, violent cop than you might expect. He looks older and pudgier, like he drinks himself to sleep every night and doesn\u2019t really trust that life has much in store for him. Rockwell has a big arc in this film and he takes no false steps, as usual. Harrelson is great too, but the film belongs to McDormand, who can do more with a withering glare than most actresses can do with a monologue. She is simply stunning when it comes to internal language, so often revealing the pain underneath the rage. Her Mildred takes no prisoners, but also feels like someone literally torn apart inside by grief. McDormand can destroy a monologue, too\u2014a scene with a priest offering counsel is an all-timer, earning applause at my screening\u2014but she\u2019s even more impressive in the minor beats. It\u2019s the curl of a lip to fight back tears or the downward glance to stop herself from punching someone. This character is so completely, fully realized in ways that other actresses couldn\u2019t have come anywhere close to capturing. It\u2019s stunning to watch. Advertisement Of course, McDonagh deserves a ton of credit for not only directing her but giving her such a great part in such a smart script. Empathy and peace with the too-common injustice of our world is a common theme in cinema, but it\u2019s usually handled with kid gloves or pat resolutions. There are no easy answers in McDonagh\u2019s world\u2014no clear-cut heroes and villains. You will start to question Mildred and you will start to defend Dixon. In a sense, that\u2019s one of McDonagh\u2019s most stunning tricks with this film. The world is more complex than most movies would have you think, and it takes a writer of his remarkable ability to convey that. He\u2019s also operating at a more technically accomplished level than ever before, particularly in the way the film uses a great score from Coen regular Carter Burwell and well-balanced cinematography from Ben Davis. Not every speedbump given us by life teaches us tolerance. A daughter shouldn\u2019t die at all, much less brutally. But what do we do with that knowledge? How do we channel our anger at an unjust world? \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d is one of those truly rare films that feels both profound and grounded; inspirational without ever manipulatively trying to be so. Very few recent movies have made me laugh and cry in equal measure as much as this one. Very few films recently are this good.

{"Title": "Kong: Skull Island", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "All monster films fall into one of two categories: the kind that takes its time revealing the monster, and the kind that shows you the monster right away and never leaves it for long. Think \u201cJaws\u201d (fins and scary music for the first hour) as opposed to \u201cDeep Blue Sea\u201d or \u201cSharknado\u201d (Shark-o-Rama pretty much throughout). Most versions of the King Kong story have fallen into the first category: the 1933 original, the 1976 remake, and Peter Jackson\u2019s three-hour 2005 version unveiled the big ape gradually. \u201cKong: Skull Island,\u201d on the other hand, introduces Kong after less than half an hour, then keeps him (and lots of other big, scary creatures) front and center throughout the film\u2019s 118-minute running time. There\u2019s even a moment where another character tells a story about Kong battling creatures and the movie cuts to images of Kong battling the creatures, in case you weren\u2019t getting your fill of monster-on-monster action.  Advertisement I\u2019m not mentioning the difference in approach to condemn the new Kong: quite the contrary. This one\u2014about a team of soldiers and scientists that gets stranded on Skull Island during a mission to map the island\u2019s geological interior with explosive charges, which you absolutely should not do when visiting a place called Skull Island\u2014is a half-magnificent, half-misguided example of a \u201cshow me the monster\u201d movie. At its best it reminded me of \u201cThe Mysterious Island\u201d and \u201cThe Land that Time Forgot,\u201d films that were little more than collections of monster-driven action scenes hitched to a perfunctory story about explorers wandering a jungle, doing stuff they were warned not to do, and getting eaten. The cast includes a couple dozen people who are basically monster chow and therefore not worth describing here; a World War II airman who\u2019s been trapped on the island for 28 years (woolly-bearded John C. Reilly, who steals the film instantly and never gives it back); a tough, quiet British SAS officer (Tom Hiddleston) who has amazing hair; a Special Forces colonel (Samuel L. Jackson) who develops an Ahab-like obsession with killing Kong; a war photographer (Brie Larson) who looks like a Breck girl and has no meaningful plot function; and a wild-eyed visionary (John Goodman) who believes the earth is hollow and filled with beasts whose existence predates the dinosaurs.  The latter theory was also advanced in Gareth Edwards\u2019 2014 \u201cGodzilla,\u201d a slow-reveal monster film. As you may have heard, this new Kong inhabits the same universe as Edwards\u2019 \u201cGodzilla\u201d and represents stage two in Warner Bros' scheme to Marvel-ize the giant monster picture by releasing an interconnected series of films that will build to King Kong fighting Godzilla. Annoyed as I am by the studios\u2019 obsession with \u201cexpanded universe\u201d storytelling, it seems tailor-made for films with apes and lizards the size of skyscrapers. I say this with the authority of a man who probably spent months of his childhood making animal and dinosaur figurines fight each other in a sandbox, so don\u2019t even try arguing with me, there\u2019s no point.   Advertisement The monsters are brilliantly designed and skillfully animated (except for a few shots where Kong looks a tad cartoony), and the army of visual and sound effects artists convince you that that these CGI titans live and breathe and weigh hundreds of tons. The title character tears into his foes with the ferocity of an MMA fighter, even using crude weapons when fists and teeth aren\u2019t enough. His opponents include a giant octopus, a fleet of Huey gunships, and creatures that look like wingless pterodactyls with skull-beak heads. Whenever the action flags, the film stirs more creatures into the humans\u2019 meandering trip across the island, including regular-sized pterodactyls, giant insects, and a battleship-sized water buffalo that might\u2019ve been drawn by Hayao Miyazaki. (Alas, the giant ants described by Reilly\u2019s character never materialize.) Thing is, though, \u201cKong: Skull Island\u201d seems uncomfortable with being pure childish fun. And the basic theme articulated in both this movie and Evans\u2019 \u201cGodzilla\u201d\u2014Mother Earth doesn\u2019t belong to us, and She can shake us off like a bad case of fleas if we get too uppity\u2014isn\u2019t enough for the filmmakers, either. Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts (\u201cThe Kings of Summer\u201d) with a script credited to three writers, the film is set in 1973 during the aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. At first this seems like a handy way of explaining why the world doesn\u2019t already know about Skull Island (global surveillance satellites were a new thing back in \u201873) while fetishizing mid-century analog technology a la Wes Anderson (there are loving close-ups of 35mm movie and still cameras, vinyl record players, rotary phones, and mainframe computers with magnetic tape spools).  Soon enough, though, you realize that \u201cKong: Skull Island\u201d wants to make other kinds of statements, though about what it\u2019s not sure. It\u2019s encrusted with layers of pop culture homage and political allegory that keep threatening to add up to something but never do. Vogt-Roberts is on record calling this film a parable of the United States military getting swallowed by the jungles of Vietnam, just in case you didn\u2019t notice all the homages to classic Vietnam movies, particularly Oliver Stone\u2019s \u201cPlatoon\u201d and Francis Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d (the IMAX poster for \u201cKong: Skull Island\u201d is even modeled on Bob Peak\u2019s 1979 poster for Coppola\u2019s film). When Vogt-Roberts isn\u2019t blatantly raiding the most famous \u2018Nam movie soundtracks (Jefferson Airplane\u2019s \u201cWhite Rabbit,\u201d Creedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s \u201cRun Through the Jungle\u201d and The Chambers Brothers\u2019 \u201cThe Time Has Come Today\u201d all get a workout) he stirs in undigested chunks of Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse\u201d inspiration, Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness,\u201d naming one character Marlow (after the book\u2019s principal narrator) and another, ahem, Conrad. (As a friend put it, \u201cI love the smell of ape palm in the morning.\")  Advertisement This kind of stuff would consistently land with a ping instead of a thud if the film were weirder and funnier\u2014though to be fair, it is weird and funny at times, especially when serving up vivid throwaway images, such as a Richard Nixon bobble-head doll bouncing on a chopper\u2019s dashboard or an M-60 machine-gunner bracing his tripod against a Triceratops skull. Vogt-Roberts is a rare American director who can tell a joke with a shot. The more random the joke, the funnier it tends to be. Unfortunately, every time the film\u2019s prankish eye puts a smile on your face, a misjudged line or idea wipes it off. Characters keep making cryptic \u201cmeaningful\u201d statements like \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose the war, we abandoned it\u201d and \u201cSometimes the enemy doesn\u2019t exist until you go looking for them,\u201d but these never really sync up with images of Kong surviving a napalm attack or a band of grunts sneaking through a prehistoric killing field.  Meanwhile, the movie's casually ethnocentric approach of representing Americans as Americans and the cultural \"Other\" as giant apes, cattle, bugs, and snaggle-toothed demon beasts that come screaming up out of the earth like Vietcong commandos goes unexamined. There are also mute tribespeople who worship Kong as a protector-god. Who knows: there might even be a wider allegory about the Cold War, embedded in the characters\u2019 debates over whether Kong is a good guy or another monster. Is Vogt-Roberts trying to make King Kong a political-mythological emblem of the United States, akin to Godzilla for Japan? Maybe Kong, the last of his kind, is supposed to be the lone superpower, a kindhearted tough guy that only wants to be left alone but keeps getting pulled into other people's fights, like John Wayne, the Hiddleston character\u2019s childhood hero. Maybe the razor-toothed carnivorous beasts are the communist axis of China and the USSR, and the bugs and plant eaters and tribespeople are unaligned countries. Then again, maybe not.  \u201cKong: Skull Island\u201d is best viewed on a huge screen with surround sound, through a child\u2019s forgiving eyes. Childhood flashbacks notwithstanding, I like my monster films to have a touch of poetry, and except for a sequence near the end featuring the Aurora Borealis, this one is poetry-deprived. It's personality-deprived, too. Only Reilly's wisecracking castaway and a literal-minded lifer played by \"Boardwalk Empire\" regular Shea Whigham linger in the mind. Kong himself is less a character than a hairy symbol of whatever the film requires, and the requirements change from scene to scene. But you do get to see the big guy slurp octopus tentacles like soup noodles and spike a chopper like a volleyball, and I'd be lying if I said that wasn't awesome. This is a two-and-a-half star film; the extra half-star is for the creatures, tiny versions of which are surely coming to a sandbox near you.     Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Unfreedom", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "The first feature by co-writer/director Raj Amit Kumar\r\nbegins by throwing the viewer into a seemingly random series of events, set in\r\nIndia and in the United States\u2014Delhi and New York City to be specific. Kumar\u2019s\r\na pretty busy (I presume he\u2019d prefer the term \u201cdynamic\u201d) cinematic storyteller.\r\nSo between the multiple characters, fast-shifting settings (an artist\u2019s studio\r\nwith a nude female painter stalking around it, the TKTS plaza at Times Square,\r\na backyard barbecue, a changing room for a woman prepping for a wedding, and so\r\non) and eye-opening action (why is the woman prepping for a wedding suddenly\r\nplaying with that gun, depicted in quick cuts showing her brandishing it in a\r\nvariety of ways, including, whoa!, putting it in her own mouth?), he builds up\r\nplenty of intrigue right away. At least one wants to figure out who these\r\ncharacters are, and how their stories are connected.  Advertisement Eventually who the characters are becomes clear, as does\r\ntheir lack of connection except by way of the concept so inelegantly put\r\nforward by the movie\u2019s title. The New York-based story finds a\r\nfundamentalist who\u2019s come in from Pakistan and is assigned by sleeper ops to\r\nkidnap a Muslim cleric who preaches an anti-extremist perspective. In India, a\r\nyoung woman forced into an arranged marriage pines for her lesbian lover, the\r\naforementioned nude artist, and takes radical action to be reunited with her, part\r\nof which includes turning the aforementioned gun on a male lover of the artist.\r\n These storylines are not just intercut with some showy\r\ncorrespondences (a New York highway becomes a Delhi road in the flick of an\r\nedit) but are interspersed with flashbacks, fantasy sequences, and more.\r\nDialogue is presented out of sync and used to push the visual action forward\r\nin time. Kumar has a very evident\r\ncommand of a lot of filmmaking techniques. He\u2019s clearly pretty passionate about\r\nthe stories he wants to tell. But as the film goes on, the stories become ever\r\nmore\u2026well, \u201cfar-fetched\u201d isn\u2019t a sufficient term to describe what they become.\r\nThe kidnapping plotline in particular takes twists and turns that are extremely\r\noverbaked, and once the extremist has got his battered victim back in a cozy\r\nbrownstone, and has got the cleric, his young wife, and their young son all\r\ntaped down to various household surface, the movie ventures into the realm of\r\npure grindhouse sadism. It\u2019s borderline reprehensible, in spite of Kumar\u2019s intentions.\r\nIlluminating the depradations of a self-styled jihadist is one thing; holding\r\nthe viewer by the back of the head and shoving his face into a welter of\r\nsimulated blood is another, and it\u2019s not a strategy that\u2019s likely to build a\r\nlot of viewer goodwill. Similarly, the sad end of the Delhi plotline is a\r\njailhouse scene in which a defied father gives tacit approval to something no\r\npatriarch should ever permit is not presented as explicitly, but still has an\r\nemphasis one can only describe as morbid. Do such outrages happen in real life?\r\nOf course they do, and they\u2019re awful, but their representation in this work is\r\nso willfully heavy handed that coherence of any kind\u2014artistic, dramatic,\r\nideological\u2014finds no bearing. As accomplished and committed as most of the cast\r\nis, one doesn\u2019t so much find affinity with the characters they play as feel bad\r\nthat they were compelled to enact such ugly movements.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "She's Funny That Way", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cLike most people today, Judy was a cynic and was offended\r\nby the slightest hint of fantasy.\u201d So reads a portion of the opening text of\r\nthe new movie directed and co-written (with his now former wife, Louise\r\nStratten) by Peter Bogdanovich. This clunky observation, I think, misreads the\r\nmodern or post-modern condition rather grievously. Cynicism today is in fact\r\nfed by fantasy, or at least delusion; it\u2019s a mask that affects to connote a\r\nreckoning with The Real, which in fact merely enables its wearers to distract\r\nthemselves from the true horror of the world as it is today. But anyway.  Advertisement Judy, played by Illeana Douglas, is a Hollywood reporter,\r\ninterviewing newly minted star Isabella Patterson, or \u201cIzzy\u201d who, as played by\r\nthe nonetheless appealing Imogen Poots, speaks with a thick approximation of a\r\nBrooklyn accent that\u2019s meant to evoke Judy Holliday in \u201cBorn Yesterday\u201d or\r\n\u201cBells Are Ringing\u201d but doesn\u2019t even get within swinging distance of Madonna in\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s That Girl.\u201d Accents aren\u2019t even the main problem with \u201cShe\u2019s Funny,\u201d in\r\nwhich Bogdanovich tries to merge the multiple-New-York-storylined romantic comedy\r\nantics of his underappreciated 1981 masterpiece (yes, it is) \u201cThey All Laughed\u201d\r\nwith the backstage-at-the-theatre-full-of-lunatics antics of \u201cNoises Off.\u201d The\r\nmovie sure is good-hearted enough. It\u2019s a labor of love, it would seem, for all\r\ninvolved. Several younger-filmmaker admirers of Bogdanovich\u2014the one-time tyro\r\nbehind \u201cThe Last Picture Show\u201d and other outstanding films of the \u201cEasy Riders,\r\nRaging Bulls\u201d era\u2014teamed up here to produce the long-gestating picture. Noah\r\nBaumbach, Wes Anderson and George Drakoulias are all credited as executive\r\nproducers. Their clout, plus Bogdanovich\u2019s reputation, and the goodwill he\u2019s\r\ngarnered over years of working as an actor, no doubt helped pull together a\r\nwonderful cast, including Owen Wilson, Kathryn Hahn, Rhys Ifans, Will Forte,\r\nJennifer Aniston, Austin Pendleton, and a lifeboat\u2019s worth of recognizable\r\ncameo players. On paper, the premise of the movie is not untenable. Owen\r\nWilson plays theater director Arnold, in New York after working on a Hollywood\r\npicture, about to embark on a new stage project starring superstar pal Seth\r\n(Ifans), Arnold\u2019s own wife Delta (Hahn), and a supporting player in the role of\r\na hooker to be named later. Speaking of hookers, Arnold\u2019s got a weird habit: he\r\nlikes to solicit call girls, take them to a nice dinner, boink the bejesus out\r\nof them (\u201cYou are the most\u2026attentive kinda lover,\u201d Izzy says to Arnold after\r\ntheir sole amorous pairing) and then gift them with $30,000, telling them to\r\ngive up The Life and go pursue their dreams. He couches this pitch around a\r\nspeech featuring the catchphrase \u201cSquirrels to the nuts,\u201d which had at one\r\npoint been the title of the movie. One marvels at a world in which even the\r\nmost successful of contemporary theater directors could repeatedly depart with\r\n30 large with such indiscrimination.\u00a0 And that\u2019s part of the problem with this\r\nmovie. Despite its preponderance of mullets among its younger players, \u201cThey\r\nAll Laughed\u201d was at least a little conversant enough with the then-realities of\r\nNew York City life; as such, it could present a recognizable world. The level\r\nof \u201cfantasy\u201d to which this movie actively aspires is so idealistic as to be\r\nlaughable, but not in an entirely good way. Old-movie lover Izzy at one point\r\nsays to Judy, about a playwright who falls in love with her, \u201cHe was exactly\r\nwhat I imagined a playwright to be, and he was the Arthur Miller to my\r\nMarilyn.\u201d No, no, a thousand times no. Too many times the characters in this\r\nmovie sprint across the line separating quirky charm from know-somethingish affectation,\r\nand then stay on the wrong side of it.  Advertisement And this erodes the sunny farcical\r\ntone to which \u201cShe\u2019s Funny That Way\u201d\r\naspires. It\u2019s as if somewhere along the way this wannabe champagne got spiked\r\nwith eager-to-please bennies. There are some good, funny bits, one involving a\r\ncab driver\u2019s vivid protest against having to sit through a feuding couple\u2019s\r\ndisagreement. Aniston\u2019s reluctant therapist character, weirdly shrill at first,\r\nactually gets funnier over the course of the movie, while Wilson underplays nicely\r\nthroughout. He could have been the picture\u2019s anchor, but the frenetic\r\nmachinations of the plot spin it away from him. Then there\u2019s the finale, in\r\nwhich the viewer ignorant of old movies gets a vivid primer in Lubitsch from a\r\nreal-life filmmaker and film buff. It\u2019s kind of cute and kind of\u2026weird, which\r\nwould be fine, only it doesn\u2019t know how weird it is.

No, \u201cTerm Life\u201d is just a run-of-the-mill, poorly made\r\nthriller that doesn\u2019t thrill.

At least it pauses briefly to address\r\nVince Vaughn\u2019s ridiculous haircut.  Advertisement Vaughn stars as Nick Barrow, a man who literally introduces himself\r\nvia narration with the line \u201cI plan heists.\u201d (The narration is the only\r\nlaughably fun part of the movie with insanely on-the-nose bon mots like \u201cBeing\r\ninterrogated by a cartel leader is not how I expected my day to start out.\u201d)\r\nNick is to illegal activity as a wedding planner is to nuptials\u2014he designs the event and then gets a cut when it succeeds. His latest plan goes awry when the perpetrators\r\nare gunned down after pulling it off. It turns out that Nick\u2019s latest customer\r\nwas the son of a notorious cartel leader (Jordi Molla). If you\u2019re thinking that\r\na movie about a drug dealer getting vengeance for his son\u2019s murder would be\r\nenough, you\u2019re ahead of \u201cTerm Life.\u201d It ALSO turns out that the robbery\r\naggravated a dirty cop named Keenan (Bill Paxton) and his crew (including Mike\r\nEpps and Shea Wigham) are the ones who actually killed the drug lord\u2019s kid to\r\nget back what he stole.  Still not enough movie for you? OK, let\u2019s graft on a\r\nfather-daughter plot. When Nick realizes that a notorious criminal mastermind\r\nand a team of dirty cops are after him, he does what any estranged father would\r\ndo\u2014he buys life insurance (hence the film\u2019s name). But, as he\u2019s told by the\r\ninsurance agent (a fascinatingly underused Taraji P. Henson, who sells the\r\npolicy and disappears), he has to survive three weeks for the blood work to go\r\nthrough, or else his daughter Cate (Hailee Steinfeld) won\u2019t get anything when\r\nhe\u2019s iced. So, Nick and Cate go on the run, provoking the suspicions of a small\r\ntown cop played by another actor too good for the size of his role (Terrence Howard).\r\nI didn\u2019t even mention the fact that Cate\u2019s mother is a recovering alcoholic. It\u2019s\r\nall so much movie and yet so little at the same time. The every-clich\u00e9-and-the-kitchen-sink approach of \u201cTerm Life\u201d\r\nleads to a crushingly bland affair. It\u2019s kind of like how every color blends\r\nto gray eventually. Nothing in \u201cTerm Life\u201d is developed enough in its 93-minute\r\nrun time to give it any weight. Paxton\u2019s villainous cop deserved a better movie\r\n(there\u2019s a scene in the middle between him and Wigham that is a perfect example\r\nof a point where the film could have become something else but went back to the\r\nmiddle of the road), as does the great Jonathan Banks\u2019 buddy and even Jon Favreau\u2019s\r\ncriminal lackey. Most of all, the talented Steinfeld gives \u201cTerm Life\u201d way more\r\nthan the film deserves, playing the anger of a young woman ignored by her\r\nfather her entire life. Sadly, Billingsley doesn\u2019t know what to do with her\r\nperformance, too often pushing it back to clich\u00e9. What do teen girls do? Go swimsuit shopping!

These people don\u2019t exist in the real world, and Billingsley has no idea\r\nhow to make it feel like they do. It\u2019s one of those films that thinks casting\r\nequates to audience concern. Why do we care about what happens to Nick and\r\nKate? Because their faces are on the poster. And it absolutely fails as an\r\naction film. Billingsley, the director of \u201cCouples Retreat,\u201d does not have any clue what to do with stunt work or shoot-out choreography. There\u2019s one\r\nscene in which Nick is supposed to throw a guy out a window and the stunt man\r\nbasically just runs for the glass, while Vaughn pats him on the back on the way\r\nby.

{"Title": "God's Not Dead 2", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"God's Not Dead 2\" is the follow-up to the huge 2014 box-office hit from the same studio that brought out similar Christian-themed movies like \"Do You Believe\" and \"Faith of Our Fathers.\" These aren't Christian movies like, say, Mel Gibson's \"Passion of the Christ,\" Carl Dreyer's \"The Passion of Joan of Arc,\" or D.W. Griffith's massive epic \"Intolerance.\" Those were films vibrating with faith that also had high and often visionary artistic value. But \"Faith of Our Fathers,\" \"Do You Believe,\" \"God's Not Dead,\" and now \"God's Not Dead 2\" are cheaply and often shoddily made, and aimed at a specific demographic. The films are the ultimate in preaching to the choir. They're so rooted to this specific time and place in American evangelical Christianity that future generations, even Christian generations, might watch them and ask each other, \"Wait ... can someone look up 'Duck Dynasty,' because it seems to have been very important to these people.\"\u00a0 Advertisement \"God's Not Dead\" told the story of a young Christian college student locked in a battle of wills with an atheist philosophy professor who wants his students to declare \"God Is Dead.\" The movie was crowded with as many subplots as an entire season of a television series, complete with a rousing concert at the end by the Christian pop group Newsboys.\u00a0 \"God's Not Dead 2\" (like that old recurring joke from \"Saturday\u00a0Night Live\": \"Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead\") gathers together much of the same cast of characters, including the Newsboys (and both were directed by Harold Cronk, and scripted by Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman). The sequel moves the action to a high school. Grace Wesley (Melissa Joan Hart)\u2014her first and last name symbolic of her importance to Christianity\u2014teaches AP History, and one day answers a question in class about the connection between the teachings of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. and the teachings of Jesus. Grace answers, quoting Scripture. The parents of the student who asked the question complain to the school. They define themselves as \"rationalists\" and \"free thinkers\" (code words for \"atheism\" in the world-view of \"God's Not Dead 2,\" and if you didn't get that, then just look at the mother's cold-bitch Alexis Carrington wardrobe as well as the fact that she doesn't grieve her young son's death). Grace is called on the carpet, she refuses to apologize, and the whole thing ends up being battled out in a court of law under the watchful eyes of the nation. The court case has its moments of interest, and plays out as it would in real-life, with different groups of protesters screaming at each other on the courthouse steps, and the constant chatter of the various zealot-outrage-brigades on television. The only really good scene in the movie features real-life cold case homicide detective, J. Warner Wallace, who used his forensic statement analysis skills on the gospels, resulting in a book called \"Cold Case Christianity.\" He's put on the stand in defense of poor, wronged Grace Wesley, and his testimony is simply delivered and thought-provoking. The gorgeous Jesse Metcalfe, as Grace's lawyer, gives a good performance as well. The character is a public defender assigned to her case. He is not a Christian, but feels strongly that she was not preaching or proselytizing in the classroom, but merely answering a question posed to her. Metcalfe adds at least a layer of nuance to the ham-fisted proceedings. There's one particularly low moment, though, where we are treated to the spectacle of a white man schooling the clueless African-American principal of the school (Robin Givens) about what Martin Luther King really meant in his famous letter from the Birmingham jail.\u00a0 Like \"God's Not Dead,\" there are a lot of subplots, some that have to do (tangentially) with the court case, and others not at all. A young Chinese student who discovers he is a Christian has a painful fight with his father that is well played (although this is the sort of movie where a son says, \"Father, I'm a Christian!\" and the father whacks him across the face. Still: it's a nice scene.) A young reporter whose cancer is in remission doesn't know how she feels about Jesus anymore. David A. R. White reprises his role as the friendly pastor Dave (White was also one of the leads in \"Faith of Our Fathers\"), who experiences life as a series of mishaps\u2014spilled coffee, a stubbed toe, a burst appendix\u2014but eventually realizes that \"we\" are at \"war\" here, and it's time to get serious about fighting back for faith.\u00a0 Advertisement Director Harold Cronk doesn't find a way to blend these scenes into a whole, although thematically each character struggles with an aspect of faith. Scenes sometimes just sit there, or taper off in an amateurish way, one example being a scene that ends with a character saying, \"I'm going to go get a cup of coffee\" and then off he goes to get a cup of coffee. Cue curtain. Flow is essential in a film with so many storylines, but when the action moves away from the courthouse in \"God's Not Dead 2,\" you can almost hear the gears creaking as the story shifts its focus. \"God's Not Dead 2\" is filled with a sense of paranoiac persecution and seething resentment towards secular public schools, the ACLU, government interference and those who don't care for \"Duck Dynasty.\" The movie is loaded with simplistic \"Us vs. Them\" thinking, comforting, perhaps, to those in agreement, but extremely disturbing to those not on board. The atheist mother is more upset when she learns that her dead son read the Bible than the fact that he is dead. Ray Wise shows up as the ACLU attorney, a character who makes Robert Shapiro (as gorgeously played by John Travolta in \"The People vs. O.J. Simpson\") seem subtle. He is the personification of evil, sneering and snickering, preening and murmuring, assuring the atheist parents in an early meeting, \"We will prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that God is dead.\"\u00a0 Early persecuted Christians would scratch the Ichthys symbol in the sand, the \"fish\" a secret code amongst themselves in dangerous times: \"I'm a believer. Are you?\" The \"persecution\" portrayed in \"God's Not Dead 2\" is ratcheted up by people's paranoia about the tyranny to come, but now, instead of scratching the fish in the sand, they murmur \"Duck Dynasty\" to one another. That's how they know they are among friends. It's inadvertently hilarious. There are serious movies about the Christian faith, about the persecution of the faithful, and about the intolerance that goes both ways. \"God's Not Dead 2\" is not one of them.

{"Title": "Willow Creek", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Writer/director Bobcat Goldthwait went camping and took two genres that should be at the end of their creative ropes\u2014the found-footage movie and the monster-in-the-woods movie\u2014with him in his latest genre oddity, \"Willow Creek,\" now playing On Demand and in select theaters. He came back with something unexpected: a slow-burn horror flick that totally works on its own modest terms, offering an example of how well Goldthwait understands the importance of sound design and forced perspective while also offering a neat bit of gender politics and even commentary on the way we often seek that which we know we should not find. Young filmmaker Jim (Bryce Johnson) and his girlfriend Kelly (Alexie Gilmore) set out to find Bigfoot, not really pausing long enough to think about what might happen if they find him. Advertisement The title refers to the infamous source of the Bigfoot legend, an entire community built up around the reports of giant, hairy creatures that roam the nearby woods and what it\u2019s done to the tourist industry. Giant statues of the big fella, murals, stories of missing campers, songs crafted about him, etc.\u2014Willow Creek rests on a bedrock of folklore. And not everyone seems to be happy that Jim and Kelly are here to document it. They get plenty of \"this might not be a good idea\" warnings, most of them echoed by Kelly herself, a woman who seems to be a passenger on a trip built as much around her boyfriend\u2019s ego as anything. Goldthwait cleverly includes multiple takes of Jim\u2019s little speeches and introductions to interviews. This isn\u2019t a guy who just wants to get Bigfoot; he wants to be a star too. \"Willow Creek\" is a defiant slow burn. Jim and Kelly tour the community, talk to locals, and continuously prepare viewers for the inevitable. As he\u2019s proven in films like \"World\u2019s Greatest Dad\" and \"God Bless America,\" Goldthwait is a smart filmmaker. He knows that you know that \"Willow Creek\" is going to get all \"Blair Witch Project\" eventually and so he plays with that expectation. Lesser filmmakers would have felt the need to have a sighting, a jump scare, a shock moment earlier in the film. Not Bobcat. You\u2019re going to hang out with Jim and Kelly (credit to Johnson and Gilmore for very believable, unforced performances) to the degree that, in one of my favorite moments when Jim proposes to Kelly, you almost forget that this is a monster movie. And then Bobcat reminds you. The centerpiece of \"Willow Creek\" is an extended sequence that everyone making a found footage film should be forced to watch. And take notes. The camera doesn\u2019t move. There are no quick cuts. There are no asides to the camera/audience to break the tension. We are merely in the tent with Jim and Kelly, watching their faces and, most of all, listening. What is scarier than an unexplainable, unidentifiable sound in the pitch-black woods, miles from civilization? \"Willow Creek\" makes the case that the answer is nothing.

{"Title": "Itzhak", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Itzhak\" is a joyous film about a joyous man. Directed\u00a0 by Alison Chernick, it's a compact and immensely likable look at virtuoso violinist Itzhak Perlman. It's less concerned with covering the totality of his life than evoking his life force, which is good-humored, earthy and inspiring.  Because of its brevity, as well as its decision to show the subject existing in the moment rather than convene a bunch of talking heads or a narrator to discuss what his life and work have meant, \"Itzhak\" is best appreciated by people who know a little bit about Perlman already\u2014or who are OK with a film that's more of a pencil sketch on a cocktail napkin than a oil painting with an ornate frame that's intended to hang in a portrait gallery. This is a work in the tradition of fly-on-the-wall\u00a0celebrity portraits from the 1960s and '70s, like the classic Bob Dylan documentary \"Don't Look Back.\" It hangs out with Perlman, his wife Toby, his extended family and some of his colleagues, and watches them interact.\u00a0 Advertisement As accomplished as the film is at a craft level, there's no denying that much of its impact comes from having chosen Perlman as its subject. He's a fascinating man who's lived a dramatic life, starting at age four, when he contracted polio that impaired his mobility but did not stop him from becoming one of the world's most-honored instrumentalists.\u00a0 Some archival footage is deftly woven into the present-day material. This includes snippets of Perlman performing in different decades, pieces of a 1993 interview with his beloved mentor Dorothy Delay (who called him \"Sugarplum\" and asked him brain-teasing questions like, \"What's your concept of G-sharp?\"), and a clip of a 13-year old Perlman performing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\" Of the latter, Perlman acknowledges that, as talented as he clearly was, even at that tender age, he was booked because of his heroic handicapped-kid-overcomes-adversity story\u2014and that this particular aspect of his narrative has guided many of his choices as a public figure and philanthropist. The Perlmans' marriage is the foundation of the movie. Their interaction is a model of a fully functioning, long-lasting union based on mutual intellectual respect as well as affection. They've been together over 50 years and still enjoy each other's company. Toby is his biggest fan as well as advocate. \"When I hear that sound, when I hear that playing,\" Toby says of Itzhak's musicianship, \"It's like breathing. It's like being alive.\" But she's also his toughest critic, and has no compunction about telling him that a performance that dazzled thousands wasn't up to his highest standards.  From the opening scene of Perlman riding an Amigo scooter through the passageways of Citi Field en route to play \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before a New York Mets game, through late sections capturing his performance of John Williams's score for \"Schindler's List\" (for which he served as lead violinist), the film confirms Perlman's popular touch. He's a great raconteur and listener, so charismatic that he naturally claims the spotlight wherever he is, yet one can't help being struck by his approachable demeanor. Whether conducting an orchestra, sitting in with Billy Joel, dining with friends and family around a large table, or accepting an award, his accomplishments and aura never precede him, nor do they defensively cloak him in \"greatness\" or separate him from the supposed rabble. He seems delighted to be a part of the world he moves through, and that his art has made more bearable. He seems particularly amused by small children and pets.  Advertisement The filmmaking itself displays mastery in the spirit of its subject. There's never a doubt that you're in the hands of craftspeople operating at the peak of their powers, even as each choice serves the work.  Helen Yum's editing is superb. It displays a rare sense of how to cut musical performances and dialogue together in a way that preserves the continuity of the music while favoring the forward motion of the story. The editing of the non-musical scenes is equally impressive. There are a number of moments where the cutting of conversations attains a musicality of its own, evoking instruments in an orchestra taking cues from one another as well as the conductor.  A student in a class being guest-taught by Perlman astutely observes that, in musical performance, it's not enough just to hit the right note at the right moment: one must devote equal thought and care to entering and exiting the note, because it's the decision of when to get in and out, and how, that shapes emotion. She could be describing this documentary, a musical film about music and life.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Miss Sloane", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Legend has it that the term \"lobbyist\" originated during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, who referred to the petitioners bombarding him with requests for support as \"lobbyists\" because they always ambushed him while he was trying to relax with a brandy in the lobby of the Willard Hotel in Washington. The DC Mythbusting Series has debunked that story, finding the term in use as far back as the 1600s (always with the same wheeler-dealer connotation). Whatever the case may be, \"lobbyists\" are still with us, and who or what they represent is often cloaked in mystery, making them potent fodder for conspiracy theorists and paranoid political thrillers. One particular lobbyist\u2014a ferocious take-no-prisoners individual named Elizabeth Sloane, played by Academy Award nominee Jessica Chastain\u2014is the center of John Madden's \"Miss Sloane.\"  Advertisement With a script by first-timer (and it shows) Jonathan Perera, \"Miss Sloane\" charts the course of a woman who works for a conservative lobbying firm, but jumps ship after being asked by her scowling-eyebrow-ed boss (Sam Waterston) to support the powerful gun lobby in their opposition to a new gun law featuring regulatory checks on the purchase of firearms. Sloane takes her entire team with her, sans one\u2014her devoted assistant Jane (Alison Pill)  who decides to stay behind\u2014to a rag-tag low-rent lobbying outfit headed up by Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong), devoted to pushing through that controversial gun bill.  To say Miss Sloane is a ruthless lobbyist does not even begin to cover it. She is the Keyser S\u00f6ze of lobbyists. She is the Bobby Fischer of lobbyists, going up against grade-schoolers playing checkers. She is every mastermind serial killer on \"Criminal Minds,\"\u00a0psychopaths with the wherewithal to pepper their crime scenes with 75 red herrings, baffling organizations following the blood trail. While there is a satisfaction in the spectacle of a Lone Wolf outsmarting the fat cats in Washington, and while the character of Miss Sloane is given fascinating and bizarre depths (unexplained for the most part, a welcome change), \"Miss Sloane\" plays like a naive fantasy (perhaps its release date has something to do with that).  Miss Sloane's political convictions are unknown. She is not an idealist or an activist. She does not have any convictions outside of winning (a philosophy she verbalizes multiple times throughout, including in the direct-address opening scene). She will do anything\u2014anything\u2014to win. Her colleagues are thrown under the bus, used, lied to, betrayed. This aspect of the story is refreshing, making \"Miss Sloane\" more of a character study than anything else. It is the character study aspect of the film that is most interesting.  Advertisement Her personal life is nonexistent. She pops pills in secret, presumably speed since she never sleeps. She is awkward in everyday human interaction. Her friendship with underling Esme Manucharian (an excellent Gugu Mbatha-Raw) has a disturbing power-imbalance from the start. There are many shots (too many) of people turning to one another with expressions of, \"Is this lady for real?\" We get the point: she's outside-of-the-box, she's brilliant, she's scary. At one point, Schmidt\u2014who poached her from her old firm\u2014asks her point-blank: \"Were you ever normal? What were you like as a child?\"  The action switches back and forth between Senate hearings investigating Miss Sloane's unorthodox and perhaps illegal dealings and the events that led her to that point. Perera's  awkward script makes it abundantly clear just how difficult it is to pull off Aaron Sorkin-esque dialogue, the rat-a-tat-tat of \"The West Wing\" or \"The Social Network,\" featuring people wholly fluent in complex \"insider\" language. It's challenging to write and it's challenging for actors to deliver. The dialogue in \"Miss Sloane\" is stilted in the extreme (\"My bank account and liberal conscience won't justify owning a car\"), in particular in the group scenes, where the \"banter\" never lifts off the page.\u00a0 Chastain is a naturally emotional actress: in her nearly-wordless performance in \"The Tree of Life\" she is so alive onscreen you can practically see the pulse beating in her wrists. Miss Sloane is not that kind of character. Chastain is a pleasure to look at, in her dizzyingly high heels, ice-white skin and bright red lips. Madden and cinematographer Sebastian Blenkov\u2014fresh off of \"Men & Chicken\"\u2014do right by their star, lighting her and framing her in the most dramatic way possible, reveling in her coloring, her striking silhouette, getting as close as possible to her to examine the flashes of expression in this strange character's eyes. But she\u00a0wears the character of Miss Sloane like a costume. There's a flatline quality to Chastain's voice in this role (not heard in her other performances) that makes the dialogue sound even more over-written; there\u2019s no range, no prosody. Advertisement When \"Miss Sloane\" really works is in the scenes when Miss Sloane is by herself (not coincidentally, the scenes with very little dialogue). The relationship between Miss Sloane and Esme is fascinating: the repeat scenes where they suss each other out and form a wary bond are filled with dramatic tension. Jake Lacy, who continues to surprise with his diversity of character roles, is riveting as the only character who treats Miss Sloane like a human being and\u2014in a beautiful irony\u2014one of the only characters in the entire film with a moral compass. Their scenes together are extremely well-played and well-written, pointing out the deficiencies of the script elsewhere.  The biggest problem is not the film's fault. Opening as it does two weeks after the ugliest election in U.S. history (although the election of 1800 would give it\u2014and any other\u2014a run for its money in that regard), \"Miss Sloane\" feels almost quaint now, even with its ends-justify-the-means cynicism, even with its vision of life on The Hill as a ruthless battle to win at all costs. The film is not so much tone-deaf as old-fashioned, emerging from a more innocent time (say, three weeks ago) when \"politics as usual\" actually had some meaning.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "In Jackson Heights", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Children play on a playground in Jackson Heights, Queens, running through sprinklers, batting at oversized chimes. Parents and sitters look on. On another street in the neighborhood, people march to protest a local restaurant that denied service to a transgender woman. In a mosque, men pray and listen to a sermon. Soccer fans gather outside an electronics store with a huge flatscreen TV in the front window, watching the game; their anxious faces are reflected in the glass. At a farmer's market, stall-keepers lay out their wares and residents inspect them: tomatoes, zucchini, strawberries, cherries. In a halal restaurant, a man butchers and plucks chickens and ducks. In a city councilman's office, a woman listens patiently on the phone to a constituent who has a problem and tries to let her know as politely as possible that she's not agreeing or disagreeing with her, she's just listening. The sun rises on Jackson Heights. The sun sets. The sun rises and sets again. The city noise creates its own abstract collage of music and sound: salsa, marimba, jazz, soul, sirens, cell phone rings, alarms, the hiss of city buses braking and the whine of their acceleration, the rumble and rattle of elevated trains.  Advertisement Too lyrical? Too abstract? Too bad. The film is the film. The film is \"In Jackson Heights.\" It's hard to write about \"In Jackson Heights\" without sounding like you're trying to write poetry.  That's how precise Frederick Wiseman's new documentary is. That's how refined the 85-year old director's aesthetic has become.  As in nearly all of his previous movies\u2014stretching back fifty years, astoundingly\u2014Wiseman practices what journalists would call \"pure reporting.\" Which means there's no hook, no obvious narrative spine\u2014he's just decided to go somewhere and hang out and watch people and listen to them and then report on what he saw and heard. This movie is the report. It's a reporter's notebook of a movie. And it might be the lightest, loosest warmest nonfiction film he's made since \"Boxing Gym,\" and maybe ever. Wiseman makes movies about institutions of one sort or another: high schools, army bases, domestic violence shelters, New England towns, college campuses. They are not about what's right or wrong with the institutions, although if you watch them closely you might get a clue about the filmmaker's opinion; the way he arranges material suggests one possible way of thinking about the subject, or one possible conclusion to draw, without ever closing down alternate avenues of interpretation. The films are by necessity decentralized, but they are not disorganized. There's an internal logic to how they're put together. A Wiseman logic. Wise man's logic.  David Simon, the creator of \"The Wire\" and \"Treme,\" is on record saying how much he admires Wiseman, and you can see in Simon's work certain affinities, particularly his conviction that stories about communities be told as democratically as possible, jumping among lots of characters and trying to give them something like equal weight, no matter what they happen to be going through. The films of Robert Altman (\"Nashville,\" \"Short Cuts\") and Richard Linklater (\"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Bernie\") often practice something like a Wiseman aesthetic, too. There are certain methods for telling this kind of story, intuitive ways. Wiseman is the master. Advertisement Watch \"In Jackson Heights\" and notice how he gets from one location to another. His cameras might be spirits that can disappear and reappear in increments. We're in a place, we stay there a while, we listen to neighborhood advocates talk about a rental crisis or an immigrant's rights group sharing stories about the perils of getting relatives from Mexico to the United States. And then we leave. We leave by moving outside of the building and standing on the street. Then we move to another street. Maybe we look at a street sign or the exterior of another storefront, or a restaurant under a stretch of elevated train track, or the front door of a house on a leafy residential street. And then we're inside meeting new people, hearing new stories, experiencing different lives. But they're all the same life, in a way, because they are all alive at this moment (the film was shot in the summer of 2014 and ends with Fourth of July fireworks) and because they are all Americans, or people living in the United States, or because they are simply people, and simply living, and often living simply. Wiseman has occasionally been rapped as a cold or even misanthropic director; I've never seen that in his films, but that's one rap against him.  In any case, \"In Jackson Heights\" is the most vibrant refutation of the charge that I've seen, and I've seen a lot of Wiseman films. Every frame of it seems delighted by people, delighted by cities, by neighborhoods, delighted by life itself. It's warm and attentive. It cares about every person, every story, that passes before the camera's lens, and about the hints of stories contained in fleeting closeups of old women listening to street musicians and old men sitting on park benches and city workers counseling voters and restaurant workers getting through the day. There is a subtle gratitude to the way Wiseman and his sound editors weave city noises (the Mr. Softee ice cream jingle, for example) throughout the film, linking one location to another, one life to another, as if to affirm that it doesn't matter if you're black, white, brown, Irish, Italian, Mexican, Dominican, Jewish, Muslim, male, female, straight, gay, bisexual, transgender, adult, juvenile, anyone, anything, it's all the same life, the only difference is what corner of it we inhabit, what piece of it we see.  Despite its talk of citizenship and what it means to be a New Yorker and a U.S. citizen, \"In Jackson Heights\" is less patriotic than humanistic. It's glad to be alive and glad that other people are, too. \"I was happy till my husband died,\" says a very old woman in a nursing home. \"There's nobody left in my family, nobody, and if there is, I don't know of them.\" Another old woman notes how very old she is, then asks her, \"What's your secret?\" \"If I find out what it is,\" she replies, \"I'll tell you.\" Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Vampires will always be with us, representative as they are of  humanity's endless interest in blood-sucking creatures of the night who  stand in the tense space where fear meets desire, and two of the  dreamiest most romantic movies released this year have been vampire  movies. Jim Jarmusch's \"Only Lovers Left Alive\" created a nocturnal  dreamspace of love and old (really old) age, and music and survival,  with two soul mates meeting up again and again throughout the endless  abyss of time. Ana Lily Amirpour\u2019s black-and-white debut feature \"A Girl  Walks Home Alone At Night,\" with a vampire in a chador stalking the  denizens of an Iranian town called \"Bad City,\" owes a lot to Jarmusch,  and in many ways the relationship seen between the two lead characters  in Amirpour's film could be seen as the younger incarnations of Adam and  Eve in \"Only Lovers Left Alive.\"\u00a0 Advertisement Along with Jarmusch, \"A Girl Walks  Home Alone At Night\" is steeped in other influences: Spaghetti Westerns,  1950s juvenile delinquent movies, gearhead movies, teenage rom-coms,  the Iranian new wave. There's an early 1990s grunge-scene club kids feel  to some of it, in stark contrast to the eerie isolation of the  nighttime industrial wasteland in which the film takes place. The number  of influences here could have made \"A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night\"  yet another movie-mad parody or an arch exercise in style; instead, the  film launches itself into a dreamspace of its own that has a unique  power and pull. The images are suggestive and symbolic, resonant with  intersecting meanings and emotion, nothing too spelled out or  underlined. Some of the images sit there unmoving for too long, but that  very same stasis also helps create and enforce the underlying tension,  the tormented space between people even when they are standing very  close together. The film feels extremely personal. It is clear in every  frame that Amirpour has put her own dream onscreen. Filmed in the desert in California, with an excellent Iranian ex-pat cast,  \"A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night\" introduces us to a sprawling yet  interconnected cast of characters. They all live in Bad City, an Iranian  town filled with bad bad vibes, surrounded by pumping oil drills, seen  like galumphing prehistoric beasts, going up and down, up and down. The  opening sequence is classic Spaghetti Western (even down to the font of  the title credits), mixed with a James Dean-era aesthetic, with a kid in  a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and a 1950s pompadour walking around on  the blasted-out outskirts of town. He drives a tail-finned Ford  Thunderbird, its chrome gleaming in the bright sun, the car carrying so  many powerful associations with it, of cool-ness, of Americana, of  mobility, of status. The characters we meet are archetypes, made strange when in service to  Amirpour's unique vision. There is Arash (Arash Marandi), the kid with  the vintage car who lives with his heroin-addicted father Hossein  (Marshall Manesh). Arash deals drugs, too, as well as taking odd jobs as  a gardener on the isolated rich side of town, having a tense flirtation  with a rich girl who calls him into her bedroom. Dominic Rains plays  the pimp Saeed, with the word \"SEX\" tattooed on the front of his throat,  who supplies Hossein with drugs, steals Arash's precious car as  payment, and harasses and abuses the prostitute (Mozahn Marn\u00f2) who works  the dangerous streets for him. There is a little boy wearing a ragged  coat (Milad Eghbali) who is a witness to everything, an innocent  bystander to the corrupt and horrifying events of Bad City going on  right before his eyes. Advertisement And then there is the vampire, known as Girl (Sheila Vand). The shadows  are so pitch-black that she is able to stalk the streets in her full  chador practically undetected. She hides almost completely in the  liquidy black, revealing herself to her victims from across the wide  expanse of vacant lots or abandoned parks. At one point, she skateboards  down the middle of an empty dark street, her chador flowing behind her  like gigantic black bat wings. The Pimp thinks she might be a  prospective streetwalker and invites her back to his place, turning up  the techno music, laying out lines of coke on the table. She stands  motionless in the background, a shrouded, staring figure. People do  not understand what she is or who she is, until it is too late. Arash, let loose into the night, trying to get his car back from the  pimp, trying to meet up with the rich girl at a nightclub, encounters  the gliding ghostly figure in a chador a couple of times before they  connect. At one point, returning from a costume party (where he went as  Dracula), he runs into her on a lonely deserted street. When she sees  the drunken Dracula staring up at a lamp-post, mesmerized by the light  pouring out into the night, she stops. Does a double-take. Dracula? Is  that you? They have a couple of scenes together, two in particular, one in her  basement dwelling place and one out by a power plant, that rank as two  of my favorite sequences in any film this year. Both shiver and pulse  with unspoken feeling, longing, and an acute and earnest romanticism.  The walls of The Girl's dingy apartment are covered with posters from  concerts she has clearly seen in the course of her eternal life: The Bee  Gees, Madonna. She listens to records on a turntable. There is a  whirling disco ball spinning above, throwing its lights across the  grime. In a wordless moment he moves towards her as she stands at the  record player, her back to him, the music creating a wall of sound, a  wall of feeling. There is a rhapsodic catharsis in a moment like that,  the stasis of all that came before suddenly releasing  itself in a whoosh of emotion. Advertisement Conversely, that same static feeling can sometimes just sit on the screen, the tension within the frame  dissipating, the image a beautiful picture but with no further  revelations to be had within it. Stasis can make the film sag, on  occasion, slacken and lose that taut weird otherworldliness. For the  most part, though, Amirpour helms the ship confidently and with a lot of  love and care. Similar to Jarmusch, music is extremely important to Amirpour (who has  also worked as a DJ), and the music choices in \"A Girl Walks Home Alone  At Night\" are intuitive and perfectly placed. There are a lot of catchy  Iranian pop songs, and a couple of sequences are built explicitly around  the song used as underscoring. Amirpour has a great feel for that, merging the events onscreen to the  song choice in a way that feels inevitable, in a way that opens up the  scene. Much of the romanticism in \"A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night\" comes from  the visuals (Lyle Vincent shot the film). The cinematography is  glamorous black-and-white, crisp and specific, with light from the  lamp-posts and car headlights refracting and fuzzing across the screen  in a blurry line. The contrast between black and white is high, but  there is much spill-over, light cutting through the blackness with  difficulty, leaving fragments of itself in a trail behind. There are  moments that stand alone, images both familiar (as though seen in a  dream or a deja vu), and yet never presented before in just such a way: a  black-veiled woman standing on the other side of an empty parking lot,  barely perceptible through the gloom, surrounded by nothingness, a  figure from a nightmare. The Girl is a vampire who targets men, specifically men who are mean to  women. Because she is in a chador, one can make all kinds of political  and social connections with that storytelling device: she is an avenging  angel of dominated and scorned womankind. Amirpour lets the images do  all of the work for her, a huge strength of the film. The image of a  female vampire skateboarding down a street, her voluminous veil flying  out behind her, does the job with more poetic satisfaction and truth  than any explicit monologue about the repression of women could ever do.  At one point, she leans to whisper in the ear of the frightened urchin  child, telling him to \"be a good boy.\" It sounds like a threat. Be a  good boy, or else \u2026 But these are undercurrents only, the subterranean  basement of the film's psyche. Essentially, \"A Girl Walks Home Alone at  Night\" is a film about film, a fresh and exciting re-imagining of a  well-worn oft-told genre. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}

As the two men grow to trust each other,\r\nthe impossibility of Mohamed\u2019s situation is illuminated. Yes, he is guilty of a\r\ncrime. The crime, he says, was the result of a him-or-me-and-my-family\r\ndecision. Left to hang by themselves, though, his actions will create an endless\r\nand destructive cycle of recrimination. If he escapes, he insists, nothing will\r\nbe solved. Only his own sacrifice will make things right. \u201cGetting killed by\r\nthe French is the only solution.\u201d  Daru has a hard time grasping this. Their journey offers other\r\nchallenges as it progresses. There is rain. The Algerian rebellion against\r\nFrench rule had begun. It hasn\u2019t had much impact on the mountain village where\r\nDaru teaches, but Daru and Mohamed meet some soldiers on their trip, which\r\nprovides an opportunity for some backstory. It also recalls, in a low-key way,\r\nan episode from Leone\u2019s \u201cThe Good, The Bad, And The Ugly.\u201d There is a very understated brothel,\r\nrecollecting \u201cThe Last Detail.\u201d There is a lot of stark natural beauty,\r\ncaptured very well by cinematographer Guillame Deffontaines. And there is\u2026not a\r\nlot more, as it happens.\u00a0 In addition to muffing the d\u00e9nouement of the story on\r\nwhich it\u2019s based, \u201cFar From Men\u201d is also the kind of movie in which sobriety and a stalwart sense of seriousness yield more inertia than profundity. Its solemnity\r\nnever becomes actively oppressive, but it shuts out not just humor but grace.\r\nWhat it falls back on, rather than the troubling truth illuminated in Camus\u2019\r\nstory, is the movie-standard gaze of compassion, here proffered by Mortensen,\r\nwho, it must be admitted, does it well. His French isn\u2019t bad either, although\r\nhis character gets a backstory that explains its sometimes halting quality\r\n(French natives are worse sticklers for accents than American movie critics, as\r\nit happens). His work, and Kateb\u2019s, are exemplary. It\u2019s also pleasant to see\r\nthe great Angela Molina, so memorable in Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s final film \u201cThat Obscure\r\nObject of Desire,\u201d pop up here in a small role.

{"Title": "Queen of Earth", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Alex Ross Perry\u2019s \u201cQueen of Earth\u201d is as unsettling as any\r\nhorror film that you\u2019ll see this year but it so by virtue of its filmmaking and\r\nits performances instead of a twisting and turning narrative. Echoing dramas of\r\ninternal conflict turned into threats of physical danger like \u201cPersona\u201d and \u201cRepulsion,\u201d\r\nPerry explores the concept that it is the human mind and its emotional undercurrents\r\nthat is the most terrifying thing in the world. Anchored by incredible\r\nperformances from Elisabeth Moss and Katherine Waterston, this is one of the\r\nmost mesmerizing pictures of the year.  Advertisement \u201cQueen of Earth\u201d opens with a tone-defining close-up of\r\nCatherine (Moss). Her makeup has run into bags around her eyes, her hair is\r\ndisheveled, and she is emotionally drained. It is brutal, unsparing and direct.\r\nPerry doesn\u2019t pull back and offer much coverage, just a couple close-ups of\r\nCatherine\u2019s now-ex-boyfriend James (Kentucker Audley). He is breaking up with\r\nher, and she is not taking it well, noting that this is the kind of emotional\r\nblow, coming shortly after the death of her father, that will devastate her. As\r\nwe will quickly learn, Catherine was one of those people who was deeply\r\nco-dependent on two men in her life\u2014her father and her boyfriend. When the\r\nformer dies and the latter leaves her, she will be totally adrift and border on\r\nunstable. To try to bring her back to Earth, friend Virginia\r\n(Waterston), Ginny to her friends but only\r\nher friends, invites Catherine to spend the weekend at her family\u2019s cabin in\r\nthe woods. Editor Robert Greene deftly intercuts back to a similar weekend a\r\nyear ago in which the roles were reversed\u2014Catherine was there with James and\r\nVirginia was the lonely third wheel, resentful that a girls\u2019 weekend turned\r\ninto a triangle. Almost subconsciously (but maybe not so sub-) creating the same dynamic a year later, Virginia\r\ninvites her neighbor Rich (Patrick Fugit) to spend time with her and Catherine\r\non this sun-kissed weekend. Catherine hates Rich. It could be just because he represents\r\na gender she doesn\u2019t feel like seeing right now, or that, like Virginia last\r\nyear, she resents her emotional healing being invaded. If this all sounds like the set-up for a mumblecore drama,\r\nyou\u2019re not wrong. And yet \u201cQueen of Earth\u201d has a very different tone than the\r\nwork of Joe Swanberg. First, there\u2019s the unusual friendship between Virginia\r\nand Catherine, two people who can be devastatingly, dangerously honest with\r\neach other. They take stabs at each other to see how much the other one will emotionally\r\nbleed. They are kind of awful to one another in the way friends know the buttons\r\nto push that enemies do not. Ginny accuses Catherine of living in her father\u2019s\r\nshadow and tied to her ex-boyfriend, almost as if she\u2019s pushing her friend\r\ndeeper into depression, knowing she has to face some realities before she can\r\nreturn to normalcy. And Perry very carefully focuses more often on the\r\nlistener, more interested in the impact of what\u2019s being said on the person who\r\nhears it than the act of saying it. Advertisement That impact pushes Catherine closer to the edge of sanity.\r\nShe tells a visitor one night, \u201cYou know,\r\nI could kill you and no one would know,\u201d and Moss delivers the line with\r\njust the right mix of humor and truth, as if she\u2019s only half-kidding. Perry\r\nalso uses ominous music throughout \u201cQueen of Earth,\u201d much like the\r\npsychological thrillers from the \u201870s that the film sometimes cribs from,\r\nraising tension through score as much as action. We feel something bad is going to happen. Will Catherine kill herself?\r\nKill someone else? Her world has shattered and every way in which she defines\r\nherself (she even worked for her father) is gone. As she says, \u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I exist anymore.\u201d\r\nAnd Ginny says she cares about Catherine\u2019s recovery, but does she? \u201cQueen of\r\nEarth\u201d is terrifying because it is so emotionally unmoored\u2014Catherine is a\r\ncharacter with little reason to care about anything or anyone, and Perry and\r\nMoss convey the danger of that brilliantly. Moss has been a TV awards regular for her great work on \u201cMad\r\nMen,\u201d and killed it last year in \u201cThe One I Love\u201d and Perry\u2019s \u201cListen Up\r\nPhilip,\u201d but this is the best work of her career. She is both shattered and\r\nterrifying, the kind of person you want to help but who you\u2019re a little scared\r\nto talk to. She plays Catherine as totally psychologically untethered and\r\ndrifting further away from normalcy, but she doesn\u2019t chew the scenery in doing\r\nso, grounding Catherine\u2019s breakdown in realism. Waterston is just as good,\r\nproving that breakthrough in \u201cInherent Vice\u201d last year was no fluke. Her third\r\nact work here is particularly terrific, as Ginny starts to realize that\r\nCatherine may not be exactly where Ginny was last year\u2014she\u2019s further down the road\r\nof depression. Like the emotional turmoil of real heartbreak, \u201cQueen of\r\nEarth\u201d refuses easy answers. It will frustrate some viewers in its lack of\r\nconclusions, but Perry is more interested in tension than pay-off. Those hazy,\r\nuncertain days of our lives when our definitions of ourselves have to change\r\nand we\u2019re not even really sure who our friends are or how we feel about them makes\r\nfor remarkably ambitious territory for a filmmaker to explore. Alex Ross Perry\r\nis a remarkable filmmaker.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Flatliners", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Deep in the bowels of a university's medical school, a group of students intentionally kill themselves for minutes at a time to experience what lies beyond. This is a fabulous idea for a movie, but unfortunately \"Flatliners\"\u00a0represents the second failed attempt to do it justice. It's not a terrible film, and neither was the original. They're both frustratingly not terrible: the cast acts the hell out of every moment, struggling to find profundity in situations that are conceived in the most superficial way, often settling for cheap horror movie jolts and \"it was only a dream\" false alarms, and things wrap up so neatly that the sense of wonder and terror inherent in the story remains largely untapped.\u00a0 Advertisement Joel Schumacher's 1990 original was a surprise hit, starring a cast of soon-to-be-huge stars, including Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland, who has a supporting role here; but its premise, which could have opened the door to a visionary work of\u00a0sci-fi horror, settled into a sort of gothic self-help drama groove, with the medical students realizing that the seemingly supernatural\u00a0goings-on triggered by their experiments in \"flatlining\" were\u00a0manifestations of their past misdeeds.\u00a0Director\u00a0Niels Arden Oplev\u2019s remake,\u00a0adapted by Ben Ripley from Peter Filardi's\u00a0original script, sticks to that template, changing key details here and there while embracing a style that stirs every current horror movie visual cliche into a jagged paste.\u00a0 Ellen Page stars as Dr. Courtney Holmes, whose kid sister died in a car accident years ago due to her negligence. She corrals a group of fellow residents\u2014Diego Luna's earnest and responsible Ray, Nina Dobrev's flirty\u00a0hardcore Marlo, James Norton's rich kid Casanova Jamie, Kiersey Clemons' stressed-out and mommy-dominated Sophia\u2014to administer heart-stopping drugs to kill her for three minutes and heart paddles to wake her back up so that she can report what she saw. She experiences a sensation of flying and sees angles on the campus and the city that she's\u00a0never personally experienced. This is enough to\u00a0convince her colleagues\u2014except for the\u00a0cautious and ethical Ray,\u00a0who's there mainly to guard against tragedy\u2014to undergo the same treatment.\u00a0 But then (ominous bass fiddles!) mysterious things start to happen. Courtney is visited by an\u00a0apparition that's obviously\u00a0connected to her feelings of guilt over her sister's death. In short order, Jamie, Marlo and Sophia all begin experiencing creepy events and disturbing visions. By the time the movie reaches its midpoint, there's no question of where the film has to go before the credits roll. \u00a0 Fully 20 percent of the movie's\u00a0running time consists of\u00a0characters wandering along through dark apartments,\u00a0basements and corridors, wondering if the\u00a0noises they hear\u00a0are just their imaginations while out-of-focus shapes and faces dart through the\u00a0negative space nearby. Sometimes these shocks are\u00a0amplified by a\u00a0shriek of atonal soundtrack music, and once in a while you'll get a jolt of graphic violence that rarely has any long-term consequences. The whole thing is too much of a tease, and once you figure that out, there's no actual suspense to speak of, just momentary\u00a0manipulations. Advertisement The cast gives the movie everything they've got. Luna and Page in particular make much stronger\u00a0impressions than you might\u00a0expect, given the repetitious and mostly shallow scenarios they're asked to enact, and there are a couple of moments\u00a0near the end where Sophia's story snaps into focus and finds just the right\u00a0balance between inspirational\u00a0melodrama and horror that otherwise eludes the movie. But the choppy, cliched visuals and the script's superficial approach to the characters' predicaments (people are constantly\u00a0stating the obvious to each other, and to the audience)\u00a0ultimately undo any goodwill that the actors can generate.\u00a0 This sort of movie can be more frustrating than a maliciously terrible\u00a0or blunderingly incompetent film because at each step you can tell that everyone involved in the production sincerely\u00a0believed in the material, both as raucous\u00a0entertainment and as a tale of moral growth. But when the best you can say about a movie is that it means well, that's proof that it's\u00a0not working on any level that matters.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Boss", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"The Boss,\" a comedy starring Melissa McCarthy and directed by her husband, Ben Falcone, is more interesting to talk about than it is to watch. That's not saying much, because it is the worst kind of bad movie. This film about a disgraced businesswoman trying to reinvent herself isn't actively, confidently, exuberantly bad, in a way that engages with you and forces you to react. It's passively bad. It switches gears to no discernible purpose and has things happen that don't constitute \"events\" in any meaningful sense, and throughout its last hour it keeps jumping into your lap and demanding love without doing anything to earn it.\u00a0 Advertisement I said up top that Melissa McCarthy plays a disgraced businesswoman trying to re-invent herself. If that description were the main motor driving \"The Boss\" it might've at least had some zing. McCarthy is a brilliant physical comic, in a particular mode: id-monster, reptilian brain clowning. She's the kind of actor who can crash through a wall spouting gibberish and make you believe that it's something that a person might actually do. Like Jonathan Winters, Chris Farley, early Steve Martin and Robin Williams, she shines when disrupting order\u2014when unthinkable desires suddenly seize her characters, or unacceptable thoughts make their way from their brains and express themselves as uncalled-for, bizarre or hurtful observations. But that's not what she's doing here. Here she's mostly begging for love. McCarthy's other star vehicles have had a bit of this \"please love me\" thing, but in general, the less obviously her films go to that well, the more focused and entertaining they are (which is one reason why \"Spy\" is a better film than \"Identity Thief\"). McCarthy's character in \"The Boss,\" Michelle Darnell, is a self-help guru and businesswoman extraordinaire who was raised in \r\nan orphanage where she was repeatedly paired up with possible adoptive \r\nfamilies who all rejected her and sent her back to the care of the \r\nsisters. The movie drains her of any distinguishing characteristics save poor impulse control and pathological neediness. When the neediness overwhelms everything else (which happens around the 15 or 20 minute mark) the effect is off-putting and depressing, and there are no compensatory virtues (brilliantly staged slapstick, well-rounded characters, audacious images) to distract you from how tedious it all is.  What a shame; the filmmakers might've really had something. The opening ten minutes do a fine job of explaining, within the confines of super-broad comedy, how this woman channeled her feelings of loneliness and rejection into financial success. Michelle fills huge auditoriums with people who've come to hear her preach the gospel of wealth and autonomy: cutting off people who are dragging you down, not giving a damn what anybody thinks of your ambition and appetite, doing whatever you have to do to get over on the competition. Michelle makes her entrance on a huge sculpture of a phoenix, a mythological animal that will pop up as an inspirational symbol later. She whips ticket buyers into a frenzy by promising to teach them how to make \"some real f-----g money!\" As written by McCarthy, Falcone and Steve Mallory, this sequence and the one immediately following have a goofy satirical spark. Even without the orphanage backstory, we would have figured out that the heroine grew up poor: she thinks of money only in terms of what she can buy with it, and her idea of how rich people live is a cartoon fantasy of fancy cars, country clubs, hotel suites, valets, and self-portraits. It's bracing to watch Michelle profit off people who also think of money in terms of vindication and happiness. There's a metaphor for modern America in here somewhere, and \"The Boss\" gets close to finding it. Advertisement Then Michelle's former lover (mad-eyed Peter Dinklage, who completely commits to a small, weird part) sends her to prison for insider trading. When she gets out, she has no money, property or status and is for all intents homeless. She insinuates herself into the life of her former assistant, Claire (Kristen Bell) and Claire's daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson). Michelle then gets the bright idea of turning Claire's baking prowess into a product line that will displace the film's Girl Scout stand-in, a nonprofit organization peddling cookies nationwide.\u00a0 After that, most of the film's scenes hinge on Claire and Rachel being affected by Michelle making rash, huge decisions without their approval,\u00a0always returning to whether or not Michelle will accept the unconditional love freely offered by adorable Rachel.\u00a0As the mature one of the trio, Bell,\u00a0a terrific actress in screwball comedy and hard-boiled roles, is wasted in a part so bland that anyone could have played it.\u00a0 There are a few good bits of slapstick in \"The Boss,\" including an early teeth-whitening scene where McCarthy speaks with her lips drawn back to expose her gums, and a clash of rival girl gangs that rips off the battle of the news teams in \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.\" But the mindless sappiness (which, unlike sentimentality, is a sin in comedy) ruins everything. The movie has no point-of-view on Michelle except that she needs support and should get it, and it goes about expressing this notion so haphazardly, hammering on what it imagines to be your buttons, that it makes a supposedly fearsome businesswoman seem incompetent, unhinged and pathetic.  Seventeen years ago, the great cultural critic Ron Rosenbaum wrote a piece titled \"Dear Albert Brooks: Please Don't Go Warm,\" about \"how warmth ruins comics.\" He wasn't talking about comedians acting in dramas\u2014that's a different mode, and there are many successful examples of performers switching between them\u2014but the tendency of great screen clowns to re-tool their abrasive, chaotic, even demonic screen personas, and appear in movies that are all about how sweet their characters are deep down, and how the world just needs more love, etc. Rosenbaum was writing about a man whose films evolved from hard-edged and a bit confrontational to fuzzy, but his hypothetical notes from a studio executive to Brooks could have easily been spoken to Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and many other comics: \u201cYou can be more than a comic, you should be a star, a leading man, and\r\n leading men have to be lovable. Give yourself a little warmth. Make \r\nyourself a romantic hero.\u201d It's a dangerous game to play, and McCarthy loses it here. There's nothing going on in \"The Boss\" except Melissa McCarthy groveling for affection from the same viewers who already bought tickets to see her.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "A Merry Friggin' Christmas", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\" is being sold as a parting gift from its\r\n late co-star, Robin Williams, but it's a better example of Williams' \r\ntendency to enliven rather slapdash films by imbuing his characters with\r\n more sincerity and soul than they might have otherwise had.\u00a0 Williams\r\n has a small but colorful supporting part in this Yuletide-themed \r\ncomedy, which was directed by Tristam Shapeero from a screenplay by \r\nMichael Brown. He plays Mitch, the alcoholic patriarch of an extended \r\nfamily that he's been disappointing since the '70s. His son, a \r\ntight-sphinctered hedge fund manager named Boyd (Joel McHale of \r\n\"Community\"), is haunted by childhood memories of his father, a cynical,\r\n boozing crank. A recurring flashback finds drunk daddy telling little \r\nBoyd that there is no Santa, and that the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy \r\nand other childhood constructs are b.s. as well. \"The whole world is \r\nfull of lies, boy,\" Mitch slurs. \"The only road to heaven is to realize \r\nthere's no road to heaven.\"\u00a0 Advertisement As a grownup, Boyd overcompensates for his father's chaotic darkness, embracing an \r\nOzzie-and-Harriet idea of domestic stability in a marriage to Luann \r\n(Lauren Graham of \"Gilmore Girls,\" in a thankless reactive \r\npart), instituting a rules-and-nutrition obsessed lifestyle for his two \r\nkids Vera (Bebe Wood) and Douglas (Pierce Gagnon of \"Looper\"), and \r\nforsaking his childhood interest in bridge and painting for a boring but\r\n lucrative job in the financial services industry. And he's obsessed \r\nwith preserving his young son's illusion that there is in fact a Santa \r\nClaus. Wacky Christmas misadventures ensue when Boyd's PTSD-suffering brother, Nelson (Clark Duke), asks him to be \r\ngodfather to his new adopted baby, who's being christened on Christmas \r\nEve. This leads to a forced family reunion in Boyd's native Wisconsin, \r\nduring which we spend stressful quality time with Mitch, his \r\nlong-suffering wife Donna (Candice Bergen), and Boyd's stereotypical \r\nredneck sister (Wendy McClendon-Covey) and her no-account husband (Tim \r\nHeidecker), a convicted flasher and all-around pig. The\r\n above makes \"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\" sound like a bleak drama, a \r\nlow-key family dysfunction film along the lines of Jodie Foster's sly Thanksgiving staple \"Home for the Holidays,\" or maybe a \r\ncorrosive comedy of can-you-top-this outrageousness a la \"Bad Santa.\" \r\nUnfortunately, what we get is a patchwork combination of all those \r\nmodes, none of which manage to gel. There's a \r\nrunning joke involving a filthy, alcoholic, apparently homeless Santa \r\n(Oliver Platt), broad slapstick, a wacky-angry car chase, dumb jokes at \r\nthe expense of immigrant Mexicans and Afghanis, and lots of scenes in \r\nwhich characters scream tediously expository insults at each other, \r\npresumably to bully us into thinking that their dialogue is funny.\u00a0Then\r\n the film will switch gears and drop intriguing but regrettably \r\nunfocused hints that it has a deeper understanding of the human \r\npersonality and wants to say something honest about it. Advertisement The heart of \"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\" is the relationship between an alcoholic father and the\u00a0now-adult children he has traumatized and let down. (One of them has\u00a0erased Mitch\u00a0from a family picture: patricide by PhotoShop.) The gradually \r\nunfolding flashback that haunts the adult Boyd is a metaphor of sorts. \r\n\"Santa,\" the character, is a stand-in for our childhood illusions, or fantasies, about \r\nwhat life ought to be: the lies we tell each other and ourselves, and \r\nthat society tells us, about what constitutes an ideal family, an ideal \r\nmarriage, ideal parenting, and so forth\u2014and that gnawing emptiness that \r\nmany of us endure when reality doesn't live up to the hype. (By \r\nprotecting his son's illusion that there is a Santa Claus, the hero is \r\nalso protecting his son's illusion of his father as a perfect, caring, \r\nall-powerful patriarch: Father Christmas indeed.)\u00a0The\r\n tension between Boyd's wish that his father apologize and reform and \r\nMitch's inability to change\u2014i.e., between our parents as we wish they were, and as they are\u2014might have made for poignant, \r\nlow-key, observant human comedy. \u00a0 But that's not possible here, thanks to all \r\nthe forced, theoretically crowd-pleasing but actually tone-deaf clowning\r\n that drowns out intelligence and sincerity. There are a few\r\n nice moments of performance and filmmaking (including the elaborately \r\nchoreographed final shot), but not enough to redeem a film that seems to flinch from the harsh truths it was presumably created to address.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "In the early 1930s, a bunch of people yearning for isolation and self-sufficiency, and looking to flee the oncoming war in Europe, moved to the remote Galapagos Islands. The kind of people who want isolation are often those who cannot \"play well with others\", and one cluster of German ex-pats, living on the island of Floreana, 60 miles from the nearest island in the chain, broke out into an out-and-out war with one another, resulting in a couple of mysterious disappearances and deaths (unsolved to this day). \"Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden,\" a new documentary directed by Daniel Geller and Dayna Goldfine, tells this mostly-forgotten story. It's fascinating stuff, and while the documentary is bogged down with too much information (it feels like two films shoehorned into one), that murder-mystery from the 1930s draws us in, especially when you see all the home-movie footage of the original players in this strange island melodrama.  Advertisement In 1929, Berlin doctor Friedrich Ritter, disenchanted with modern civilization, and obsessed with the works of Nietzsche, pulled up stakes and moved to the Galapagos Islands with his admiring acolyte Dore Strauch. Hell is definitely other people, and there were already rumblings of trouble in their high-flung mission. Strauch had multiple sclerosis, and Ritter treated her condition as an annoyance, and seemed to feel she was slacking in her hard labor duties. Ritter wrote home letters to his family complaining about Dore, saying, \"I cannot relax the sternness of her education.\" Ritter was a humorless bore.  Over the course of the next couple of years, two other groups of people arrived on Floreana, setting up camp, all of whom were greeted with varying degrees of hostility by Ritter and Strauch. There were the Wittmers, a German couple, who had read Ritter's articles about the Galapagos Islands and followed in his footsteps. (Note to Ritter: Do not advertise your glorious isolated paradise if you want to keep it to yourself!) After the Wittmers showed up, a flamboyant woman swooped onto the island, seemingly from out of nowhere, trailing two young men behind her, calling herself the \"Baroness Eloise von Wagner Bosquet\". She was supposedly a millionaire, she said stuff like, \"The man isn't born who can resist me,\" and she wanted to build a \"grand hotel\" on the island of Floreana. It was rumored that the Baroness and the two men with her all slept in the same bed.  There is a lot of first-hand material read in voiceover, letters, journal entries, all of the players gossiping viciously about one another, with Cate Blanchett leading the cast as the voice of \"Dore Strauch\". The filmmakers chose to also delve into the social history of the Galapagos Islands, interviewing many current inhabitants, exploring what it means to live in such an isolated outpost. Fascinating stories though these may be, they lack the narrative thrust of that historical murder-mystery, with its sexual intrigue and mythical \"Baroness\" and Nietzsche-driven temper tantrums. We keep wanting to go back to that, to find out what happened to all of those people we see, endlessly laughing and playing with goats and hacking up palm fronds in the home video footage. Repeatedly, the tension of that original storyline is slackened, as yet another side-narrative is introduced. It is not surprising that Gellerand and Goldfine would find all of it compelling, but it makes \"Galapagos Affair\" a frustrating experience.  Advertisement Nobody knows what happened back then. But people vanished off the face of the earth. Everyone has a different theory on \"whodunit,\" and the fun of the film is to make your own guesses. The best part may very well be an actual 1932 silent movie, filmed on Floreana, and shown in its entirety in \"Galapagos Affair\". The silent film is called \"The Empress of Floreana,\" starring the real-life Baroness as a conniving and bra-less pirate queen, coldly killing innocent interlopers who dared step foot on her virgin shore.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Visit", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "M. Night Shyamalan had his heyday almost 20 years ago. He leapt out of the gate with such confidence he became a champion instantly. And then...something went awry. He became embarrassingly self-serious, his films drowning in pretension and strained allegories. His famous twists felt like a director attempting to re-create the triumph of \"The Sixth Sense,\" where the twist of the film was so successfully withheld from audiences that people went back to see the film again and again. But now, here comes \"The Visit,\" a film so purely entertaining that you almost forget how scary it is. With all its terror, \"The Visit\" is an extremely funny film.\u00a0 Advertisement There are too many horror cliches to even list (\"gotcha\" scares, dark basements, frightened children, mysterious sounds at night, no cellphone reception), but the main cliche is that it is a \"found footage\" film, a style already wrung dry. But Shyamalan injects adrenaline into it, as well as a frank admission that, yes, it is a cliche, and yes, it is absurd that one would keep filming in moments of such terror, but he uses the main strength of found footage: we are trapped by the perspective of the person holding the camera. Withhold visual information, lull the audience into safety, then turn the camera, and OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT?\u00a0 \"The Visit\" starts quietly, with Mom (Kathryn Hahn) talking to the camera about running away from home when she was 19: her parents disapproved of her boyfriend. She had two kids with this man who recently left them all for someone new. Mom has a brave demeanor, and funny, too, referring to her kids as \"brats\" but with mama-bear affection. Her parents cut ties with her, but now they have reached out \u00a0from their snowy isolated farm and want to know their grandchildren. Mom packs the two kids off on a train for a visit. Shyamalan breaks up the found footage with still shots of snowy ranks of trees, blazing sunsets, sunrise falling on a stack of logs. There are gigantic blood-red chapter markers: \"TUESDAY MORNING\", etc. These choices launch us into the overblown operatic horror style while commenting on it at the same time. It ratchets up the dread. Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) want to make a film about their mother's lost childhood home, a place they know well from all of her stories. Becca has done her homework about film-making, and instructs her younger brother about \"frames\" and \"mise-en-sc\u00e8ne.\" Tyler, an appealing gregarious kid, keeps stealing the camera to film the inside of his mouth and his improvised raps. Becca sternly reminds him to focus.\u00a0 Advertisement The kids are happy to meet their grandparents. They are worried about the effect their grandparents' rejection had on their mother (similar to Cole's worry about his mother's unfinished business with her own parent in \"The Sixth Sense\"). Becca uses a fairy-tale word to explain what she wants their film to do\u2014it will be an \"elixir\" to bring home to Mom.\u00a0 Nana (Deanna Dunagan), at first glance, is a Grandma out of a storybook, with a grey bun, an apron, and muffins coming out of the oven every hour. Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) is a taciturn farmer who reminds the kids constantly that he and Nana are \"old.\"\u00a0 But almost immediately, things get crazy. What is Pop Pop doing out in the barn all the time? Why does Nana ask Becca to clean the oven, insisting that she crawl all the way in? What are those weird sounds at night from outside their bedroom door? They have a couple of Skype calls with Mom, and she reassures them their grandparents are \"weird\" but they're also old, and old people are sometimes cranky, sometimes paranoid.\u00a0 As the weirdness intensifies, Becca and Tyler's film evolves from an origin-story documentary to a mystery-solving investigation. They sneak the camera into the barn, underneath the house, they place it on a cabinet in the living room overnight, hoping to get a glimpse of what happens downstairs after they go to bed. What they see is more than they (and we) bargained for. Dunagan and McRobbie play their roles with a melodramatic relish, entering into the fairy-tale world of the film. And the kids are great, funny and distinct. Tyler informs his sister that he wants to stop swearing so much, and instead will say the names of female pop singers. The joke is one that never gets old. He falls, and screams, \"Sarah McLachlan!\" When terrified, he whispers to himself, \"Katy Perry ... \" Tyler, filming his sister, asks her why she never looks in the mirror. \"Your sweater is on backwards.\" As he grills her, he zooms in on her, keeping her face off-center, blurry grey-trunked trees filling most of the screen. The blur is the mystery around them. Cinematographer Maryse Alberti creates the illusion that the film is being made by kids, but also avoids the nauseating hand-held stuff that dogs the found-footage style. Advertisement When the twist comes, and you knew it was coming because Shyamalan is the director, it legitimately shocks. Maybe not as much as \"The Sixth Sense\" twist, but it is damn close. (The audience I saw it with gasped and some people screamed in terror.) There are references to \"Halloween\", \"Psycho\" (Nana in a rocking chair seen from behind), and, of course, \"Paranormal Activity\"; the kids have seen a lot of movies, understand the tropes and try to recreate them themselves.\u00a0 \"The Visit\" represents Shyamalan cutting loose, lightening up, reveling in the improvisational behavior of the kids, their jokes, their bickering, their closeness. Horror is very close to comedy. Screams of terror often dissolve into hysterical laughter, and he uses that emotional dovetail, its tension and catharsis, in almost every scene. The film is ridiculous\u00a0on so many levels, the story playing out like the most monstrous version of Hansel & Gretel imaginable, and in that context, \"ridiculous\" is the highest possible praise.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The period spy thriller \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d is only\r\nintermittently engaging and amusing, and those portions of the movie that\r\nsucceed are also frustrating. Because they\u2019re cushioned by enervated,\r\nconceptually befuddled, and sometimes outright indifferent stuff.  Adapted from the genuine-article 1960s television series,\r\nwhich paired steely, no-nonsense, mid-Atlantic-accented veteran spy Napoleon\r\nSolo with younger slightly petulant Russian moptop Ilya Kuryakin,\r\nco-writer/director Guy Ritchie\u2019s film situates itself in an early Cold War\r\nwherein J.F.K. is still giving inspiring speeches. This movie\u2019s Solo (Henry\r\nCavill) struts his bespoke-suited self right into East Berlin to spirit out\r\nfeisty femme auto mechanic Gaby (Alicia Vikander), whose dad is an A-bomb\r\nexpert now working, apparently against his will with some neo-fascist Italian\r\nshipping magnates out to spread nuke terror. Solo\u2019s here working for the\r\nC.I.A.; hot on his trail is strong-jawed, Terminator-strong Kuryakin (Armie\r\nHammer). A chase ensues with all three parties ducking each other and Kuryakin\r\nactually ripping the trunk door off of one of the cars involved. Solo and Gaby\r\ncross the Berlin Wall by means of a sort of zipline; imagine Solo\u2019s surprise\r\nwhen he soon learns that for his next mission he has to collaborate with the\r\nKGB agent who almost had him for dinner.  Advertisement A gruff Agency honcho Jared Harris, approximating a Texan\r\naccent, delivers the news and he and his KGB counterpart debrief the unhappy\r\nnew partners at a crowded outdoor caf\u00e9. Why these guys are spilling\r\ninternational secrets in a setting where they can be effortlessly overheard is\r\nthe source for one of the movie\u2019s better visual gags. Alas, the movie doesn\u2019t\r\nhave too many more \u201cgotcha!\u201ds in its bag. The two spies soon touch down in\r\nItaly, where they flirt\u2014Ilya with Gaby, and Solo with one of the neo-fascists,\r\na blah femme fatale played by Elizabeth Debicki\u2014and do spy stuff. In this\r\nmovie\u2019s reimagining of the characters, Solo has a backstory as a master thief,\r\nwhile Ilya is a chess-obsessed strong man with rage and daddy issues. This\r\ngives Cavill and Hammer amusing bits to enact, but, and here\u2019s a big rub,\r\nwhatever it is that Cavill and Hammer are supposed to bring to this movie, they\r\ndon\u2019t. They fill out their clothes very nicely, it\u2019s true, but other than that\r\nthey are to charisma what black holes are to matter. \u201cFlat\u201d really doesn\u2019t begin\r\nto cover it.  Then there\u2019s the direction. Ritchie clearly wants to revel\r\nin a pre-swinging-\u201860s vibe, but he either can\u2019t or won\u2019t commit to it in a way\r\nthat yields any actual fun. Possibly he\u2019s wary of bumping up against \u201cAustin\r\nPowers\u201d-style pastiche, but whatever the cause, when he\u2019s not being incoherent,\r\nhe\u2019s being fussy. Even the soundtrack has a kind of stick up its fundament;\r\nit\u2019s chock full of the Right Names in early \u201860s international (and largely\r\nItalian) pop, but it\u2019s largely lacking in infectiousness. Seriously, they could\r\nhave thrown in a \u201cTake It East My Brother Charlie\u201d or something and only a jerk\r\nlike me would have pointed out the anachronism.  There are times when the movie uses its leads\u2019 lack of\r\naffect in service of a cheeky sense of humor, as in Solo\u2019s sojourn in the cab\r\nof a truck, after a frantic chase scene, sitting out (or so it seems) a\r\nnear-fatal brush with danger for partner Ilya. But much of the time Richie\r\nseems uninterested in the action, although a final chase featuring a jeep, a\r\nskeletal ATV, and a motorcycle unspools like a choose-your-own-adventure video\r\ngame, and I mean that in a good way. But the misfires are just as memorable, as\r\nwhen Richie and company use realistic evocations of Nazi atrocities to fill out\r\nthe character of one minor villain. And if you were lucky enough to have seen\r\nVikander in \u201cEx Machina\u201d (and if you haven\u2019t been you ought to change that),\r\nyou\u2019ll be profoundly appreciative of just how much she\u2019s wasted here. She\u2019s\r\nadorable anyway, however.  Advertisement While it can\u2019t be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his\r\nreturn to prominence in the last half hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on\r\nearlier in the movie, peps things up considerably. Grant\u2019s character is the one\r\nthat pulls the whole \u201cU.N.C.L.E.\u201d concept together, birthing an agency in which\r\nKGB, C.I.A., and MI6 or 5 or whatever it is can cooperate to prevent mutual\r\nassured destruction or something like that. Kind of like that agency in that\r\nother summer spy thriller that this summer spy thriller is not going to present\r\nany serious competition to. In any event, an entire movie in which the\r\nweathered but still debonair Grant played the bluff, amiable puppetmaster to\r\nthe two hunky ciphers might have been great fun. I gather that Richie and\r\ncompany still want to make that movie. I have mixed feelings about whether they\r\nought to, or will.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Things to Come", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"The future seems compromised.\" That line, in Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve's \"Things to Come,\" is spoken by an editor at a publishing house, explaining to author Nathalie Chazeaux (Isabelle Huppert) why her popular philosophy textbook needs some serious revisions, maybe even an entire \"re-branding.\" The words make sense in the practical context, but when telescoped out into the themes of this beautiful film they take on enormous relevance. The future that Nathalie believed in now \"seems compromised.\" Hansen-L\u00f8ve's gift is in presenting this vast internal journey with elegance and clarity, resisting the urge for scenery-chewing catharsis, and always examining just how much time operates as a force in our lives (whether we acknowledge it or not). In one way or another, Hansen-L\u00f8ve's films are all about the passage of time.\u00a0 Advertisement Nathalie and Heinz (Andr\u00e9 Marcon), both professors of philosophy at universities in Paris, have been married for 25 years, and have two adult children. There is a comfort in the family dynamic coming from the assumptions of continuity. The kids come over for dinner. No tension swirls beneath the surface. Until one day, Heinz tells Nathalie that he has met someone else and will be moving in with her. The ensuing conversation is not accented by tears being shed or crockery being thrown. Nathalie is shocked and blindsided (\"I thought you would love me forever,\" she says, stunned), but it takes a while for the reality to really sink in. Meanwhile, life, in all its complexity, continues. Time, like the cliched river, keeps rolling on. When Fabien (Roman Kolinka), her former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, asks her how she is doing, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious. My life isn\u2019t over. Deep down, I was prepared. I\u2019m lucky to be fulfilled intellectually.\u201d You believe her.\u00a0 However, life is not just one thing, life is made up of many parts. Hansen-L\u00f8ve's narratives are about the many parts. During the year of time \"Things to Come\" takes place, Nathalie experiences the dissolution of her marriage, the dawning realization that her high-maintenance mother (Edith Scob) can no longer take care of herself, the changing of the guard at her publishing house and the troubling implications of that, and a new friendship with Fabien, a writer of great promise now living in an anarchists' collective in the countryside. She also has to figure out what to do with Pandora, her mother's independent-minded black cat. (In \"Elle,\" released last month, Isabelle Huppert also shares the screen with a memorable cat in a key co-starring role.)\u00a0 This type of story\u2014long-time marriage falling apart, 50-something woman now on her own and hanging out with her 20-something former student\u2014comes with expectations attached. We think we know what we are going to see. But Hansen-L\u00f8ve avoids all of it with \u201cThings to Come.\u201d Instead of the clich\u00e9, the film\u2014brisk at points, leisurely in others\u2014presents a real-life rhythm of events. People discuss Rousseau and G\u00fcnther Anders, they argue about the purpose of philosophy and political action. Nathalie\u2019s generation is haunted and defined by the upheaval in 1968. She looks at the idealist young anarchists, sitting around the table discussing the concept of \u201cauthorship,\u201d fighting over how to create an alternative paradigm to the only one offered, and she sees herself in her \u201cradical\u201d youth. But this is not the misty nostalgia of a Baby Boomer. At a family dinner, she says to her kids that, unlike the Stalinists she had been surrounded by back then, she \u201cread\u00a0Solzhenitsyn, end of story.\u201d She tosses that off casually as she puts the food on the table, but it\u2019s one of the many evocative details in the script that rings so true, providing the texture and context for Nathalie\u2019s world and experience. (Solzhenitsyn\u2019s The Gulag Archipelago\u00a0was published in 1973 and for many it completely detonated any lingering idealism about the USSR.) \u00a0 Advertisement What happens is not as important as\u00a0Hansen-L\u00f8ve's attitude towards what happens. In this, and in her other films, \u201cTout est pardonne,\u201d \u201cFather of My Children,\u201d \"Goodbye First Love\" and \u201cEden,\" she is interested in a character\u2014or, in the case of \"Eden,\" a specific \u201cscene\u201d\u2014and how it evolves over time. There is a George Eliot style of distance in her approach, although she is not unattached or indifferent. Her distance helps her to create extremely detailed scenarios, rich with complexity and accuracy, as though her perch on a cloud gives her more perspective. She is not intimidated by Aristotle\u2019s unities. She peppers the action with title cards: \u201cSeveral Years Earlier.\u201d \u201cOne Year Later.\u201d etc. Characters don\u2019t age visibly. She has been criticized for that with her other films, but that criticism seems to be focusing on the wrong things. She's one of our current great humanists.\u00a0 \u201cThings to Come\u201d is filled with connecting scenes that another director might cut out, thinking they are not necessary or are \u201cfiller.\u201d There\u2019s one sequence where Nathalie is first shown being driven to the train, then shown getting out of the car and running across the train platform, and then getting out of a taxi at the other end of her train ride. Another film might have just cut directly to Nathalie\u2019s eventual destination, because who cares about what\u2019s in between if nothing \u201chappens\u201d in between? But Hansen-L\u00f8ve is all about the in-between, and she always has one eye on the clock. Nobody can avoid time. Nobody can \u201cskip over\u201d steps in any given sequence (at least until teleporting is invented), and that includes fictional characters. Hansen-L\u00f8ve doesn\u2019t belabor the point (at their best, her films feel effortless), or even make a point of it at all. Everything is carefully considered and chosen, but not fetishized or dwelled upon. The overall sense is that you are watching an actual life unfold, in its minutia and in its enormity.\u00a0 Because philosophy is at the center of Nathalie\u2019s life, it is at the center of \u201cThings to Come.\u201d Philosophy is not just thought about. It is lived. At one point, Nathalie goes to a movie by herself, seeing Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s \u201cCertified Copy,\u201d starring another French luminary, Juliette Binoche. \u201cCertified Copy\u201d examines reality and illusion, forgery and the real deal: how do we know the difference? Hansen-L\u00f8ve is confident enough not to bury the lede. Nathalie\u2019s lectures to her students explicitly comment on her experiences, her current situation. So do the books she reads. So do the movies she sees. None of this is too \u201cobvious,\u201d a common criticism with such devices. (To be fair, usually directors use them with all the subtlety of a jackhammer.) In Hansen-L\u00f8ve\u2019s hands, these devices are an accurate reflection of how thinking people respond to the art they absorb. Who hasn\u2019t read a book and thought it spoke exactly to their own life at that moment? Who hasn\u2019t seen a film and thought, \u201cMy God, did that director find my journal or something?\u201d Hamlet famously says, \u201cThere are more things\u00a0in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\u201d\u00a0The toppling of Nathalie\u2019s world, the realization that her expected future has now been \u201ccompromised,\u201d leaves her open to that possibility.\u00a0 Advertisement In each of her films, Hansen-L\u00f8ve has the patience to wait for what Henri Cartier-Bresson called \u201cthe decisive moment,\u201d the moment where something \"small,\" something detailed and specific, reveals the universal. \u201cThings to Come\u201d is full of such moments. It does not have the impressive sprawl of \u201cEden,\u201d the hothouse plot of \u201cGoodbye First Love,\u201d or even the melodrama of \u201cFather of My Children.\u201d \u201cThings to Come\u201d is the detailed tapestry of one woman\u2019s life, as she moves through an important transition. Taken together, these films already represent an extremely important body of work.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Life of Crime", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The late great Elmore Leonard, on whose novel \u201cThe Switch\u201d\r\nthis movie is based, gets an executive producer credit on the movie. It\u2019s\r\nsignificant, perhaps, that said credit doesn\u2019t appear until after the movie\u2019s\r\nplayed out. Shows a certain confidence on the part of the other filmmakers:\r\nthey didn\u2019t feel the need to stack the deck with an emblem of Leonard\u2019s\r\napproval at the film\u2019s onset. It turns out, the confidence was warranted: \u201cLife\r\nof Crime\u201d is a pretty engaging, and pretty authentically Leonardesque, comedic\r\ncrime movie. While it doesn\u2019t hit the highs of the very best movies based on\r\nthe author\u2019s works\u2014those would be Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cOut of Sight\u201d and\r\nQuentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cJackie Brown,\u201d two outstanding examples of American\r\nnarrative cinema of the \u201890s\u2014it\u2019s also far less slick and ingratiating than the\r\nwatchable but very Hollywood-processed likes of \u201cGet Shorty\u201d and \u201cBe Cool.\u201d  Advertisement The assets of \u201cLife Of Crime\u201d include a relatively credible\r\n1978 Detroit setting, a generous array of seamy characters with seamy\r\naspirations (and interesting ways of talking), and a pretty first-rate cast\r\nplaying those characters. John Hawkes and the performer usually known as Mos\r\nDef, here going by the name Yasiin Bey (no, I don\u2019t know why) are the criminals\r\nLouis and Ordell, and yes, these are the same characters who turn up in \u201cRum\r\nPunch,\u201d which was the novel on which \u201cJackie Brown\u201d is based. For the purposes\r\nof this story, both of these bad guys are a little less\u2026awful than they are in\r\nTarantino\u2019s film. Point of fact, they\u2019re kind of likable, especially Louis.\r\nHe\u2019s first seen being talked into a kidnapping scheme by Bey\u2019s Ordell, who\r\nsubsequently proves his get-the-criminal-job-done bonafides by facing down an\r\nobstreperous pimp. Ordell\u2019s scheme is to kidnap the wife of a corrupt local\r\nbusinessman, and demand as ransom the money he\u2019s been secretly stashing down in\r\na tax-shelter bank in the Bahamas. There are already a lot of holes in this\r\nscheme to begin with\u2014Leonard\u2019s crooks are rarely the brightest bulbs on the\r\nChristmas tree\u2014but the biggest comes to light after the pair kidnap the\r\ndisillusioned wife, Mickey, and stash her in the home of an accomplice who\u2019s a\r\nNazi gun nut. That is, Mickey\u2019s husband, stiff-necked drunkard and all-around\r\nunpleasant fellow Frank, isn\u2019t all that interested in getting his wife back.\r\nAnd he\u2019s also got a little girlfriend at his Caribbean love nest, and she sees\r\nan opportunity in Mickey\u2019s misfortune.  Before I got off on the plot synopsis I was praising the\r\ncast, and of course Hawkes and to a lesser degree the artist formerly known as\r\nMos Def are reliable screen goods. As are Tim Robbins as Frank (a role\r\nthat would have looked tailor-made for Christopher MacDonald 20 years ago),\r\nIsla Fisher as Frank\u2019s, um, little chippie, Mark Boone Junior as the Nazi gun\r\nnut, and Will Forte as a social peer of the unhappy couple who\u2019s got a weird thing\r\nfor Mickey. The big surprise here is Aniston, who gives one of her best if not\r\nbest ever movie performances here. Although she\u2019s the female lead, she really lets\r\nherself melt into the ensemble, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the part or if she\u2019s\r\nreally upped her acting game, but her performance is measured, engrossing, and\r\nempathy-generating without any overt\r\nstriving, cutesy stuff, or sitcom-style tics. She actually develops quite a\r\nrapport with Hawkes, not a fellow you expect her to mix with either in\r\ncharacter or not. The amusing twists and turns of the script, the multiple\r\ninstances of bracing humor and consistent tension, help the cast bring this\r\nsmall-scale thriller to the place it clearly wants to be.

Pepe Serna plays Paul Del Moral, a sheriff in a small town south of San\r\nFrancisco. Out on a casual patrol one fog-shrouded evening, he finds an abandoned\r\ncar, reports on it, drives on, and is stunned when a man bounces off his\r\nwindshield. He brings the fellow to a hospital. The victim, a Japanese fellow\r\nin his 30s, is out cold.  Advertisement The movie cuts to a press conference in Japan. Young author\r\nAki Akahori (Ayako Fujitani) is being feted on the occasion of her latest\r\nnovel, which she tells her publicist will be the last featuring her popular creation, the seemingly Columbo-esque avuncular detective \u201cInspector Takabe.\u201d\r\nFreaked out by too much attention, and possibly something else, Aki hightails\r\nit to\u2026San Francisco. Without telling anyone. An impromptu meeting with some old\r\nfriends gives her a chance to show off some chops-in-deduction, traits the\r\nviewer is meant to believe she imbues her fictional creation with. But Aki\u2019s\r\nnot as cocky as all that. Toying with a straight razor in her hotel room\r\nbathtub, she\u2019s clearly in distress. Maybe the charming stranger who approaches\r\nher in the hotel bar, also Japanese, can provide some distraction if not\r\nsalvation. For a while the two narratives, that of Sheriff Del Moral\r\nand Aki, run on alternating parallel tracks. Co-writer/director Dave Boyle\r\nactually keeps the viewer guessing with respect to timelines; as various\r\n(unseen) Asian men keep turning up in different states of distressed being, and\r\nAki meets various other harried Japanese males, one is apt to wonder if the\r\nmovie\u2019s playing some sort of staggered-time game. As it happens, it\u2019s not. Once\r\nDel Moral and Aki find each other the plot both deepens and thickens. Serna, with\r\na good-humored gravitas that brings to mind Jason Robards, Jr., and Fujitani,\r\nwhose combination of vulnerability and sharpness is spectacularly appealing,\r\nmake a really intriguing team of investigators.  And that\u2019s part of the problem with the film, at least for\r\nme.  And here I must pause, and ponder the ethics of the spoiler\r\nalert. This should serve as a signal for any reader with a powerful interest in\r\nwatching the movie to stop reading now.  Still reading? Okay. Well, I\u2019m not going to give anything away,\r\nat least not directly. Instead, I shall comment on the general topic of Genre\r\nConvention and what I consider acceptable ways of Breaking Genre Convention.\r\nAny of you folks out there remember a 2008 Korean movie called \u201cThe Chaser?\u201d\r\nReally brutal, engrossing, race-against-time thriller that broke genre\r\nconvention in a lot of ways, not least of which was making its titular\r\nprotagonist the most unappealing character you could ever\r\nnot-want-to-but-nonetheless-be-compelled-to-root-for in a movie ever. Which was\r\nkind of exhilarating. But then\u2026Well, sometimes a movie oversteps its boundaries\r\nin an attempt to be \u201cdifferent,\u201d and sometimes that overstepping is a grave\r\nmiscalculation.\u00a0 Advertisement The last section of \u201cMan From Reno\u201d takes the movie into\r\nterritory explored by the original \u201cThe Vanishing\u201d and, of course, David\r\nFincher\u2019s \u201cZodiac.\u201d Legitimate avenues, arguably, but I have to admit, as a\r\nviewer who was engrossed and invested in the characters, said exploration ended\r\nup really pissing me off. But what if I\u2019m wrong to be pissed off? Hence, my\r\nthree-star rating of the movie as opposed to the two-and-a-half I\u2019d LIKE to\r\ngive it.

{"Title": "Certain Women", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "A drama teacher once told me that great drama is about the most important day in the life of the protagonist. Even if it was a generalization designed to teach a student how to bring gravity to a performance, it\u2019s often true, but not always. Great storytellers can make great drama from seemingly average days in their character\u2019s lives, sometimes offering even more insight into the human condition by transcending the mundane than highlighting the abnormal. There are several \u201caverage days\u201d in Kelly Reichardt\u2019s sublime \u201cCertain Women,\u201d an adaptation of three short stories by Maile Meloy. Working with the most high-profile cast she has to date, Reichardt delivers a multi-faceted character study, a sketch of intersecting lives in a small Montana town. It is purposefully slow, a film meant to be lived in and considered carefully when it\u2019s done. Almost none of it feels as \u201cimportant\u201d as my teacher explained and yet it is still great drama. Advertisement \u201cCertain Women\u201d opens with a train moving slowly through the heartland of Montana, honking its horn occasionally along the way. We will hear that train again, blaring its horn in the background of these characters\u2019 lives, both connecting them in our subconscious and serving thematic purpose. Reichardt returns to images of life going past this mountain town\u2014trains, freeways in the distance, a flowing river\u2014to remind us of both the ordinary nature of these stories and to connect them to each other and even our lives. The first of three barely interlocking stories opens with a lawyer named Laura Wells (Laura Dern) on her lunchtime affair with a married man named Ryan (James Le Gros). She returns to her office to find her most annoying client, a man named Fuller (Jared Harris), who won\u2019t take her legal advice that he doesn\u2019t have a disability case against his former employer because he took money from them after the accident. It turned out to not be nearly enough money but it derailed any future legal action. She takes him to a male colleague in a neighboring city, who tells him the exact same thing, but he listens this time. Reichardt is subtly laying thematic foundations about the ways in which people interact with each other\u2014female attorneys and male clients, husbands and wives, teachers and students.  After Fuller does something drastic that serves as the only real \u201caction\u201d of \u201cCertain Women,\u201d we transition to the story of Gina Lewis (Michelle Williams), wife to Ryan, the man we met earlier getting dressed with Laura. The effect of that earlier scene is subtle but crucial because we bring baggage to this second story by virtue of the fact that we know that this isn\u2019t a healthy marriage. It looks like everything is relatively fine, but Ryan is cheating. So when we see them working on a house they\u2019re building from the ground up, we know the foundation is a little weak. Advertisement Gina, Ryan and their daughter are camping on the site, next to a river, where their home will be built. On the way home, they stop off at the house of an elderly man named Albert (Rene Auberjonois), from whom they want to buy a pile of sandstone. Albert hesitates at first, melancholic over his original plans to use it for something that never happened. The gender dynamics here are crucial to understanding the scene as Albert will only speak to Ryan, making Gina more aggravated.  Finally, there\u2019s the third story of \u201cCertain Women,\u201d which could stand alone as one of my favorite short films in years. Lily Gladstone stars as Jamie, a ranch hand living on her own on an isolated farm. Her only friends seems to be the adorable dog who runs alongside her tractor, although Jamie\u2019s life is not presented as a miserable one. It\u2019s just an existence in which not much changes to day to day. And then she stumbles into a class on school law being taught by a woman named Beth (Kristen Stewart). They go out to eat and strike up a friendship and Beth becomes the break from the norm that Jamie needs. Every one of these stories has a sense of inevitability, like that river moving through the heartland. Whether it\u2019s a disgruntled client who sees no way out of his predicament, a man who closes a chapter in his life when he parts with his sandstone, or the daily grind of working on a farm. These are normal people, like you and me, and it\u2019s that relatability that makes Reichardt\u2019s work here so powerful. Every single character, even the minor ones, feel like they exist before they come into frame and keep going long after. If anything, it\u2019s the male characters who reach finality\u2014the female ones keep moving forward to the next client, project, and day on the farm. Perhaps there\u2019s something of a statement there. That\u2019s for you to decide. As for performances, this could be Reichardt\u2019s best work to date. Again, there\u2019s such a lived-in quality to Dern\u2019s approach or Harris\u2019 frustration or Gladstone\u2019s quiet emotion. Williams, a regular Reichardt collaborator, gets the least satisfying of the three narratives, but the final 45 minutes, which also features spectacular work from Stewart, more than makes up for it. There\u2019s so much internal monologue in Reichardt\u2019s approach. It\u2019s more about what Jamie doesn\u2019t say to Beth or what Laura stops herself from saying to Fuller that makes the movie work. We see so many films in which characters are constantly expressing exactly what they think and feel in ways that no one does in the real world. It\u2019s because most filmmakers are afraid of silence. Kelly Reichardt knows that so much can be said with silence. It can even be the subject of great drama. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Accountant", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cHow can you make a financial intrigue thriller more exciting than average?\u201d You can almost hear screenwriter Bill Dubuque ask that question and then crack his knuckles during the opening minutes of \u201cThe Accountant.\u201d Said opening minutes, directed with customary nose-to-the-grindstone conviction by Gavin O\u2019Connor, feature a strange scene of an urban mob massacre, tinged in sepia and boasting a lot of faux-celluloid graininess, to imply \u201cperiod grit.\u201d Then there is another scene, set in 1989, at a home for neurologically impaired kids, run by a kindly doctor who explains to a cranky dad and a less cranky mom why their \u201cdifferent\u201d son might have a better chance at adjusting to life in the world if he spends a summer at the institute. Said kid, watched over by his brother, puts together a jigsaw puzzle not only scarily quick, but also in a VERY novel way.\u00a0 Advertisement The next scene takes us to the present day, where a strip mall accountant named Christian Wolff (the allusion is to the German philosopher and mathematician, not the contemporary avant-garde musician and composer, and you can only imagine how let down I am by that), an affectless fellow played by Ben Affleck (who, frankly, is trying a little too hard to be flat\u2014the strain shows), dazzles a couple of his clients with tax code wizardry anyone who\u2019s ever filed under \u201cself-employed\u201d will recognize as pretty basic. And then we are whisked to the Department of The Treasury, where avuncular bigwig Ray (J.K. Simmons) delivers some exposition on a mystery man\u2014the fellow played by Affleck, as we already know. \u201cHe\u2019s their accountant, an accountant, \u2018the\u2019 accountant,\u201d Simmons says, sounding like he\u2019s setting up an episode of \u201cThe Blacklist.\u201d The junior officer he\u2019s telling all this to, played by Cynthia Addai-Robinson, is intrigued. And soon she\u2019s annoyed, as Simmons dredges some stuff up from her past to effectively blackmail her into tracking \u201cthe accountant\u201d down for him.\u00a0 There\u2019s quite a bit of stuff going on here, and for a good while \u201cThe Accountant\u201d percolates on its multiplicity of plot threads even as it keeps adding to them. As it happens, the \u201caccountant\u201d that the Treasury agents are looking for is up to quite a bit more than providing tax relief for rural dwellers. He uncooks the books for a slew of deadly bad guys. Deadly bad guys who are, an observant viewer will note, subsequently busted by the Treasury Department. Despite his proximity to some of the most dangerous criminals in the known universe, this man of dozens of aliases stays alive. How? Part of the answer is provided by the recurring flashbacks, in which Wolff\u2019s father (Robert C. Treveiler) provides young Christian with his more militaristic cure, which later manifests itself in sharpshooting and martial arts skills. I admit that it is a novel idea to take a \u201cRain Man\u201d-type character and also make him into a Lethal Killing Machine, but it\u2019s also in kind of bad taste, something the movie tries to ameliorate by depicting autism with sympathy and some progressive accuracy. Despite the fact that he has oodles of cash and precious art at his disposal, the accountant\u2019s life is a welter of pain, much of it in the form of self-punishment. The viewer is left to wonder why he plays the dangerous games he does.\u00a0 At that point, the nice British-accented woman who seems to be the only person he can truly trust, and with whom he communicates only by phone, tells him that it\u2019s time for him to take on a \u201clegit\u201d big client, and plops him in the lap of a high-tech prosthetic firm headed by John Lithgow. Turns out that Dana, one of that firm\u2019s accountants, played by Anna Kendrick\u2014doing, as she did in \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d fine work in a Non-Romantic-Romantic-Interest role\u2014has discovered a discrepancy. Christian uncooks it, as they say \u2026 and then very nasty assassins are dispatched to kill both Christian and Dana.\u00a0 Advertisement Here the action heats up. Christian kills a guy who looks a bit like Vice mascot and rapper Action Bronson, in a scene that is far and away my favorite in the movie. A very effective hitman/financial-malfeasance-avenging-angel played by Jon Bernthal shows up. The plot, as they say, thickens. And then it goes south. It goes very far south, with two plot reveals that are among the most ludicrous that I\u2019ve experienced in quite some time. The worse of the two twists is made genuinely hilarious by the cutaways to Lithgow watching things unfold on his home security cam monitors and looking in disbelief\u2014echoing the likely expressions of the audience. In any event, it certainly DOES succeed in being more \u201cexciting,\u201d say, than 1981\u2019s \u201cRollover.\u201d But excitement isn\u2019t always positive.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Ballad of Lefty Brown", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "This picture asks a question that I do not think is much on the mind of contemporary moviegoers: \u201cWhat happens when a Western sidekick is suddenly bereft of his Western hero?\u201d Can a hero\u2019s journey withstand being undertook by Walter Brennan or Andy Devine? We first see Edward Johnson and Lefty Brown in the dead of night, cornering a bad man and then taking care of him in a manner that Mrs. Johnson, late in the movie, will call \u201cEddie\u2019s way.\u201d Grizzled, mutton-chopped Lefty, a shambling kind of fellow most take to be incompetent, says to tall-in-the-saddle Johnson, \u201cHelluva way to start your career as a Senator.\u201d Advertisement Lefty is played by Bill Pullman, who\u2019s long proven equally adept at playing reluctant heroes and erratic anti-heroes. Johnson is played by Peter Fonda, doing a very credible John Wayne impersonation. Out on Johnson\u2019s land, looking for a cattle rustler, the soon-to-go-to-Washington Johnson contemplates Lefty\u2019s future with him. He knows that Lefty is neither a favorite with the ranch hands or with Mrs. Johnson (Kathy Baker). \u201cI reckon you\u2019re gonna stand tall or you ain\u2019t,\u201d Jefferson says. No sooner does he bequeath Lefty his rifle than \u2026 boom. Johnson falls, shot through the head by a killer that Lefty nicknames \u201cBlondie.\u201d Yes, \u201cThe Ballad of Lefty Brown\u201d is a nouveau Western besotted by older Westerns. Aside from that \u201cThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\u201d reference, \u201cThe Ballad of\u00a0Lefty Brown\u201d nods to \u201cRio Bravo\u201d with its lawman Tom (Tommy Flanagan), a drunk who\u2019s explicitly referred to as a \u201cspittoon diver.\u201d The story\u2019s tendrils reach through \u201cThe Searchers\u201d and any Western in which the railroad is coming to town. Which is fine. Less fine is the often staggeringly relentless train of clich\u00e9s in the dialogue, as when Lefty comes back to the ranch, Johnson\u2019s corpse folded over the back of a horse. Furious, Baker\u2019s now-widow says \u201cYou were supposed to watch his back.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it,\u201d Lefty responds. \u201cSorry don\u2019t get it done,\u201d Mrs. Johnson responds. Thankfully the chat is suspended and Lefty goes renegade to track the killer. In the wild he meets a young, wet-behind-the-ears gunman who\u2019s more like a gunboy. Jeremiah, nicely played by Diego Josef, is a pretty wholesome and likable example of this character sort, and he gives Lefty a chance not just to mentor but to hone his own initially questionable skills. The duo, aided by Tom, track down the killer in relatively short order, which should tip off viewers that the killing was not quite so simple as it seemed. And indeed, it\u2019s a plot, rooted in all kinds of corruption and nastiness. It takes a rather long time to get to the end of the line, not because it\u2019s all that complicated, but because writer/director Jared Moshe doesn\u2019t quite split the difference between a relaxed pace and a fatty screenplay. That said, Pullman is always great to watch, the Montana landscapes are gorgeously captured by cinematographer David McFarland, and there are a couple of action set pieces that spark. One of them involves three men in long johns fighting; one is in handcuffs. A pretty novel approach. As new-fangled Westerns go, this is less brutal than 2015\u2019s \u201cForsaken,\u201d and perhaps better for it.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "A Cure for Wellness", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "I keep forgetting the title of \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d and calling it \u201cThe Color of Despair.\u201d It\u2019s an accurate mistake. As directed by Gore Verbinski (\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" \"The Lone Ranger\"), this film about a New York financial wiz (Dane DeHaan) getting trapped in a creepy Swiss clinic wants to be sickly-dreamy horror epic. It\u2019s a black-and-white movie done in color. Bojan Bazelli's stark photography\u00a0 creates pools of blackness and acres of negative space. Jenny Beavan\u2019s retro-gothic costuming and Eve Stewart\u2019s production design favor ash, bone, eggshell, curdled cream, and shades of green ranging from bile to moss. If you could nick a David Fincher film\u2019s throat, hang it upside down, and bleed it for two days, it would look like this movie. As a fetish object, it\u2019s impressive. Advertisement But as a fully satisfying feature-length drama, it\u2019s a bust. And it\u2019s iffy as a visionary spectacle, too, because it\u2019s too long and over-scaled, and its control of tone and theme never matches the care that has been lavished on its production. This is all a shame, because there\u2019s much to admire in \u201cA Cure for Wellness.\u201d DeHaan has just the right look to play the main character, Lockhart, a corrupt young East Coast WASP who travels to Switzerland to find a missing company executive but ends up trapped at a \u201cwellness clinic\u201d run by a German-accented doctor named Heinrich Volmer (Jason Issacs). DeHaan looks like he could be Dylan Baker\u2019s long lost son, all milky angularity and cold stares. He has that look that casting directors go for when they\u2019re hiring prep school jerks or Nazi youth. The actor\u2019s straightforward performance, by turns entitled, baffled, terrified and ashamed, makes Lockhart a punching-bag hero, the kind who exists mainly to suffer horribly before achieving an enlightenment that looks a lot like comeuppance. Lockhart is insufferable at first because he\u2019s supposed to be. There\u2019s a sense in which he deserves the miseries inflicted upon him because he\u2019s a snotty capitalist swine who would otherwise grow up to be another Ebenezer Scrooge, and he\u2019s representing a system that produces Scrooges by the millions. Verbinski and screenwriter Justin Haythe (\u201cRevolutionary Road,\u201d \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d) seem at times to be making a statement about the vampire-like hold that the cultural memory of Europe still has over many rich and powerful Americans. Lockhart\u2019s predecessor went to the clinic \u201cto take in the waters\u201d\u2014which, as another character notes, is a very nineteenth century thing to do\u2014and the all-white denizens of the place seem awed by the very existence of Volmer, a handsome gadfly who has the chiseled looks of an old movie Gestapo officer but carries himself like an ambassador of reason. The clinic grounds are a replica of an identical place that burned down decades ago on this very spot\u2014there\u2019s a backstory involving taboo hideousness\u2014and there are recurring situations that pivot on insularity, hatred of outsiders, and the purity of bloodlines. (Mia Goth, who plays the doctor\u2019s daughter, is the ultimate expression of the film\u2019s anemic vision: she looks haunted and starved yet somehow also glamorous.) This is a fine starting place for a social satire and also a fine thematic flavor for a compact, dreamy horror movie. There are real ideas here, good ideas even, but they remain tantalizing but insufficiently shaped. It\u2019s only during the last half-hour\u2014a succession of over-the-top set-pieces that I loved, and that many colleagues found trashy and excessive\u2014that \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d attains the level of bug-nuts wildness that it possibly needed all along. Verbinski isn\u2019t bad at psychological and atmospheric horror, but he\u2019s often at his most original when he\u2019s letting it all hang out in sequences of clockwork suspense and ridiculous action, which is why the slapstick sequences in the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movies, the chases in \u201cRango\u201d and the last 45 minutes of \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d represent Verbinski at his most Verbinskian. It\u2019s in the maybe narratively-unnecessary final half-hour that \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d finally starts drawing the kinds of connections (through sheer excess) that give it a distinctive personality, such as a cut from a decadent, repulsive character whirling in circles after sustaining an injury to a group of clueless rich folk waltzing in a grand ballroom. Advertisement And the two-and-a-half hour running time is too much even by standards of too-muchness. It\u2019s ironic and unfortunate that the movie models so much of its look on German Expressionist silent movies and 1930s Universal horror films, because those tended to be short and lean. Very long horror movies often reach a point of diminishing returns no matter how skillfully the filmmakers sustain a mood\u2014\u201cThe Shining\u201d is a rare exception, though even that one has detractors\u2014because they give you time to think about the concept and fixate on plot holes, judgment errors and other imperfections. Verbinski is no Stanley Kubrick, although there are moments when he comes close. There are sequences involving eels that make eels seem even creepier than they did already, and a dentistry-as-torture scene that makes the one in \u201cMarathon Man\u201d look like a routine cleaning. I could easily imagine a version of \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d that\u2019s all suggestion and understatement, and one that\u2019s essentially the madcap finale played out of the length of a feature, climbing to nosebleed heights of bad taste and unfurling a freak flag at the summit. Either would have been preferable to what ended up onscreen, a rag-and-bone shop of notions. What\u2019s most conspicuously absent here is Kubrick\u2019s lordly, even naughty sense of humor. \u201cA Cure for Wellness\u201d aims for black comedy often, but rarely manages anything more sophisticated than the sick joke comic rhythm of, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing that could happen to this character?\u201d followed by, \u201cHere it comes.\u201d Lockhart\u2019s suffering grows dull through repetition. He keeps brushing up against the same realizations, onto be lied to or misdirected and find himself back where he started. Too much of this sort of thing and even patient viewers throw their hands up and moan, \u201cOh, come on.\u201d Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Christine", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "On July 15, 1974, Christine Chubbuck, a journalist and newscaster working at Sarasota's WXLT-TV, began her live broadcast with the words: \"In keeping with Channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in 'blood and guts', and in living color, you are going to see another first \u2014attempted suicide.\" She then pulled out a gun and shot herself in the head, live on-air. She died in the hospital later that day. The event sparked much controversy and conversation in the news world as well as in Chubbuck's smaller world of friends and associates. All of this laid out in intricate detail in Sally Quinn's article about Chubbuck for the Washington Post\u00a0in the immediate aftermath of Chubbuck's suicide. Advertisement Who knows what zeitgeist is at work that 2016 has seen two films about Christine Chubbuck? Is it the same zeitgeist that brought us not one, but two, films about Florence Foster Jenkins in the same year? In terms of Chubbuck, first there was \"Kate Plays Christine,\" Robert Greene's meta-documentary about an actress preparing to play Christine Chubbuck, and now \"Christine,\" a biopic directed by Antonio Campos. \"Christine,\" centered on a riveting and at times unbearably emotional performance by Rebecca Hall, attempts to give a three-dimensional and respectful-yet-honest portrait of a complex woman. Sometimes the film is successful in this, sometimes it's not. There are questions of exploitation that nag throughout, as well as a queasy feeling that we the audience are participating in exploiting this troubled woman all over again. Rebecca Hall's performance, however, is one of the most insightful portraits in recent memory of how untreated depression can operate. Depression is not pleasant, and people who suffer from it are not always sympathetic. Chubbuck is a maddening person to those who love her. Even her supporters are eventually pushed away. Chubbuck was (by all accounts) tormented by her lack of personal life, as well as her envy towards co-workers who got offers in larger national markets. She was a journalist disgusted by the increasing sensationalization of the news (she's a counterpart to her fictional contemporary, Howard Beale in \"Network,\" whose screams \"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\" become a rallying cry). So disgusted was Chubbuck that her on-air suicide is seen (by some) as a critique of said sensationalism. \"Christine\" plunges us into the rhythms of Christine's world: her devotion to her job, battles with her boss (Tracy Letts) over what stories to cover, her hopeless crush on news anchor George (a superb Michael C. Hall), her arrested-development relationship with her mother (J. Smith-Cameron). She volunteers at a children's hospital, teaching lessons to the kids with puppet shows. She sings along to John Denver songs in the car. What Hall really nails is Christine's intensity, her awkwardness, her compulsive and off-putting self-deprecation, as well as the gathering storm of an obliterating depression. She cuts a striking figure, with her veil of hair, hunched slim shoulders, gangly body language. She comes off as a teenager, uncomfortable in her own body after a growth spurt. Her demeanor is humorless. When someone sincerely compliments her, she is suspicious. Hall plays these black-cloud thoughts, the explosive temper tantrums, so close to the bone that it's an extremely confrontational and uncomfortably accurate performance. Whether or not it is representative of the real Christine Chubbuck is another question. Advertisement The production team recreates the period\u2014its music and clothes and decor\u2014in a refreshingly un-condescending way. What is most palpable is the mood\u00a0of the 1970s: the \"Watergate\" mood of exhaustion and cynicism; the tapped-out emotional reserves of a population following the burn-out of the 1960s. News anchor George brings Christine to a \"transactional analysis\" meeting, thinking it might help her work out her issues (it has the opposite effect). \"Women's lib\" is in the air, and Christine's boss lashes out during a tense meeting, \"You know what your problem is? You're a feminist.\" (The script, by Craig Shilowich, leaves something to be desired in such moments.) There will be those who do not like that so much of the film focuses on Christine's personal life (her virginity; her yearning for a boyfriend; even a date, for God's sake; the surgery she needs that will render her infertile, thus closing out the window of a future she had always hoped for). Is this \"reducing\" a woman to her reproductive functions? But these are serious issues in some women's lives, and pre-existing depression can turn them into Greek Tragedy-level confirmation of worthlessness. Overdramatic? Well, yes. Newsflash: Depression can do that. Hall understands the warped mirror of reality that depression can create, how minor disappointments register as titanic, and major disappointments are quite literally unbearable. There is a political aspect to this, of course. Christine Chubbuck was a woman working in a male-dominated industry. She watched as ingratiatingly \"cute\" reporters were promoted over her because they were un-threatening. She has a reputation for being difficult. That's because she is\u00a0difficult, and in some of her confrontations with her boss she steps way way over the line. These situations are political in nature, especially in the surrounding context of mid-1970s malaise, Watergate on TV, defensiveness about \"women's lib\" rampant, and New Age-y therapy practices\u2014emptied of the political action that ignited the '60s\u2014filling an enormous spiritual void. How would Christine have been perceived if she were a man? Advertisement \"Christine\" doesn't quite add up, though, and its commentary on the tabloid-ification of the news is not original or new. It ends on a tepid note. Since we know, going in, where the story is headed, there's a feeling of rubbernecking at a tragedy as the events mass up against her. What are we supposed to take\u00a0from the film? What is it trying to say? If she hadn't committed suicide on live television, would anyone have cared? Are these even the right questions to ask? Hall's performance is so authoritative, however, that it justifies the film's existence. She's something to see.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Home Sweet Hell", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "The first 20 minutes of \"Home Sweet Hell\" are so bleakly unfunny that it reaches an almost existential plane. Questions start arising immediately: Is it satire? Is it black comedy? What is this? Once things move into openly psycho territory, \"Home Sweet Hell\" gets a tad more interesting, but even amateurs know that you have to start strong. You have to set up the world and the tone and the mood from the get-go. Director Anthony Burns fails to do that. \"Home Sweet Hell\" never recovers from those opening scenes that take place in a really awkward universe, where actors stand around, entering through doorways at the back of the frame, and then exiting through those same doors, like a poorly blocked high school play. People seem adrift in space. There are no jokes in the script (by Carlo Allen, Ted Elrick and Tom Lavagnino), just sneers and innuendo, and the mood is unremittingly hostile towards women. The fact that a woman has Crohn's disease is meant to be hilarious, in a nudge-nudge wink-wink \"You know she's not giving her husband any sex\" kind of way. It's wretched.\u00a0 Advertisement Mona Champagne (Katherine Heigl) scrapbooks obsessively, imagining herself into a perfect life with the perfect house and yard and family. She dresses like a perky Stepford Wife, and seethes with hostility beneath her gleaming polished surface. Her two children are scared of her. Her husband, furniture salesman Don (Patrick Wilson), is henpecked, terrified, and horny, because Mona schedules sex with him once a month and only leaves 15 minutes in the calendar for it. Mona is shown scrubbing the sink with a toothbrush and yawning when Don tries to make a pass. She treats him with open contempt and yet he continues to insist he loves her, although why is anyone's guess. It's more like he's trapped in a cult.\u00a0 Don starts up an incredibly indiscreet affair with a sexy sales associate named Dusty (Jordana Brewster), who slinks and slithers her way through the furniture store, leaving Don and his partner, played by Jim Belushi, drooling in her wake. They hire her because neither of them are getting laid (Belushi's wife is the one with Crohn's), and they want something pretty to look at during the work-day. But Don is an idiot, and he sleeps with Dusty feverishly, all over the furniture store. When Dusty turns up pregnant, she starts to blackmail him for money. A desperate man, Don comes clean to Mona.\u00a0 Mona reacts quite calmly: Dusty must be killed and Don must be the one to do it. Mona makes preparations for the murder with the same cheery specificity she pours into her various decorating schemes. As a matter of fact, Mona discovers she's good at this murder thing! Like Serial Mom before her, Mona is set free by killing. Naturally, her plans go awry, and then begins the relentless bloodbath that makes up the rest of the film. There are unsavory characters with Southern accents and Scottish accents, and naked strippers who deserve better in life than to have to disrobe for \"Home Sweet Hell,\" and tormented family barbecues that go horribly wrong.\u00a0 Advertisement Katherine Heigl commits to this bad material. She means every word she says. She stalks around wearing bright rubber gloves, smiling brightly, trying to clean up various bloody messes, all while bitching at Don about how incompetent he is. Heigl has had her troubles with her public image, and Mona will not help with that, but the actress is actually doing some funny and scary stuff. The woman is a total psychopath, and Heigl commits to that. Patrick Wilson mainly seems uncomfortable, a deer in the headlights, and Jim Belushi dispenses terrible advice from the sidelines. He's a boor and a bore. There is great fodder for comedy, satire, and horror, too, in the bright world of suburbia, as well as in the women who submit to its conventionality and its material aspirations with the passion of a thousand suns.

{"Title": "Avengers: Age of Ultron", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "At\r\none point in \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" the hammer-swinging superhero Thor\r\n(Chris Hemsworth) tells the android villain Ultron (James Spader) that \u201cthere\u2019s\r\nno need to break anything.\u201d \u201cClearly you\u2019ve never made an omelet,\u201d Ultron\r\nreplies. It's nice when a movie hands you a metaphor like that. The second \u201cAvengers\u201d is a gigantic omelet combining everything in\r\nwriter-director Joss Whedon's refrigerator, pantry and spice rack, and dozens of\r\neggs are broken in its creation. This film about a team of good guys battling a brilliant, genocidal robot is bigger, louder and more disjointed than\r\nthe first \"Avengers\u201d\u2014which, like this new installment, was a crescendo\r\npicture, meant to merge strands from solo superhero movies within the Marvel\r\nUniverse. But it\u2019s also got more\r\npersonality\u2014specifically Whedon\u2019s\u2014than any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise. And in its growing pains you can see a future in which these\r\ncorporate movies might indeed be art, or at least unique expressions, rather\r\nthan monotonous quarterly displays of things crashing into other things, with splashes of personality designed to fool people into thinking they're not just widgets stamped out in Marvel's hit factory.  Advertisement You\r\nshouldn\u2019t go into it expecting a smooth ride, and you should know that there\r\nare basic ways in which it's not up to snuff. There's too much over-edited\r\n\"coverage\" by multiple cameras, as opposed to true direction with purpose\r\nand flair. (Marvel farms out the planning of its action scenes to second unit\r\ncrews and special effects artists long before the actors arrive on set, which\r\nmight account for the choppy, incoherent, \u201cjust get it done\u201d feeling of some early\r\nshowdowns.) It isn't until the final third that the movie's destructo-ramas\r\ndevelop personalities as distinctive as the film's dialogue scenes. Between Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert\r\nDowney, Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo),\r\nHawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Thor; a number of supporting and\r\ncameo players; and several new leads, including Ultron\u2019s henchpersons, the\r\ntwins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), there\r\nmight just be too many characters, even for a two-and-a-half-hour movie. (Whedon's pre-release cut came in at three-plus hours; could this be one of those rare cases where longer is better?) The film will do nothing to quell complaints that the superhero genre is sexist: Black Widow is involved in yet another relationship with a male Avenger and burdened with a tragic backstory equating motherhood with womanly fulfillment, and while Scarlet Witch has some pleasingly Carrie-like rampages, she isn't given enough to do. Still, given the band-of-heroes conceit and the mandate to serve as a high point in an\r\nongoing mega-narrative, it\u2019s hard to imagine \"Age of Ultron\" handily dispatching any\r\nof these problems. And as in the first \u201cAvengers,\u201d which was also overstuffed, Whedon manages to refine the main players\u2019 personalities and set them against\r\neach other, often in logistically complex conversations between five or more people: action scenes of a different sort.  Captain America and Tony Stark/Iron Man are at the heart of this one. They\u2019re always more intriguing\r\nwhen set against each other than when they\u2019re claiming the spotlight in their\r\nown movies, but Whedon, who also serves as a consultant and dialogue polisher\r\non other Marvel entries, has taken their conflict a step further by\r\ndrawing on events in \u201cIron Man 3\u201d and \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s Stark who creates the titular bad guy\u2014with the reluctant help of scientist\r\nand part-time Hulk Bruce Banner\u2014in response to trauma\r\nhe suffered while battling Thor\u2019s brother Loki and his extraterrestrial allies\r\nin the first \u201cAvengers.\u201d Ultron is supposed to serve as a Skynet-like artificial\r\nintelligence network that detects apocalyptic threats and swiftly destroys\r\nthem. Cap saw the horrific outgrowth of this mentality in the second \u201cCaptain\r\nAmerica,\" in which millions of alleged terrorists were nearly\u00a0 wiped out by S.H.I.E.L.D. in simultaneous extra-judicial assassinations. Cap is appalled both by the Ultron project itself and the fact that\r\nStark started it in secret because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to hear the \u2018man-is-not-meant-to-meddle\r\nmedley\u2019\u201d from his fellow Avengers. He was right to worry. Like many a sci-fi robot or Frankenstein\u2019s monster, the creature has\r\na different idea of what constitutes a threat (spoiler: it\u2019s us).  All of which makes \"Age of Ultron\" a metaphorical working-through of America's War on Terror, with Cap representing a principled, transparent\r\nmilitary, answering to civilian authority, and Stark as the more paternalistic\r\nmilitary-industrial response to 9/11 type threats, treating the masses as\r\nunruly kids who aren't allowed a voice on grounds that all they\u2019ll do is squabble\r\nand finger-point while the enemy-du-jour gathers strength. There are\r\naccusations of hypocrisy from both sides. Some of Whedon\u2019s dialogue has the\r\nsting of political satire: Cap warns Tony that \u201cevery time someone tries to win\r\na war before it starts, people die,\u201d a not-too-veiled slap at post-9/11\r\nAmerican foreign policy, while Ultron chides Cap as \u201cGod's righteous man, pretending you can live\r\nwithout a war,\u201d a comment that indicts the United States itself, if you read\r\nCap as a beefed-up Uncle Sam. Ultron, meanwhile, is another example of faith in\r\ntechnology run amok. He fancies himself a robot deity and creates other,\r\nsmaller robots in his own image (all of which speak in Spader\u2019s voice), but\r\nhe\u2019s the sadistic God of \u201cKing Lear,\u201d a wanton boy smiting flies for sport.  Advertisement For\r\nall its missteps, \"Age of Ultron\" is remarkable. If\r\nit\u2019s a failure, as many critics insist, it\u2019s a failure like Ang\r\nLee\u2019s \u201cHulk,\u201d \u201cSuperman Returns\u201d or \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises,\u201d which is to say\r\nthat it\u2019s much more distinctively personal than most of the superhero movies whose titles are synonyms for success. There are points where the movie evokes not other Marvel spectaculars, but\r\nWhedon TV series like \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and \u201cAngel,\u201d where the\r\nfun came from watching heroes and villains who were aware of themselves\r\nas heroes and villains work through psychological issues while trading screwball comedy dialogue along with body blows. In its lumpy-porridge way, this film makes a\r\nbetter case than any other Marvel picture for the notion that\r\nquarter-billion-dollar-budgeted, CGI-festooned slabs of multimedia synergy can be\r\nart, too, provided they're made by an artist with a vision, and said\r\nartist appears to be in control of at least part of the production. (I say \"part\" because Whedon is\r\non record suggesting that this movie\u2019s production broke his spirits; that could mean that\r\nwhat we\u2019re seeing onscreen is the best he can do, considering\r\nthat the true auteurs of the Marvel films are executive producer Kevin Feige and his marketing department.)  Amid\r\nthe usual quota of quips and lightning and robots and explosions are moments of\r\npathos, splendor, sentiment, and operatic horror. There\u2019s quotable dialogue,\r\ndelivered with the deadpan camaraderie of Howard Hawks (\"Bringing up\r\nBaby,\" \"Rio Bravo\u2019), and scenes that evoke earlier classics without feeling too obviously like homages. The interaction\r\nbetween Black Widow and her erstwhile sweetheart, Bruce Banner, channels King Kong: she interrupts his Hulk-outs by holding up a slender hand with slightly curved fingers, and after a moment's hesitation, the green giant reaches\r\nout in kind, like a curious ape touching his reflection in a fun-house\r\nmirror. A lyrical slow-motion set-piece sees the Avengers battling waves\r\nof Ultron\u2019s android minions in a ruined cathedral, like the Bishop gang \r\nfending\r\noff Mapache\u2019s army in \u201cThe Wild Bunch.\" The circling camera movements \r\nare echoed in the film's credits sequence, which visualizes the film's \r\nheroes and villains as figures in a classical sculpture: Marvel in \r\nmarble. The design touches are swell: Ultron might be the most\r\novertly Jack Kirby-esque apparition in any Marvel film, his expressive\r\nface comprised of thin, overlapping plates. Key lines tease out the superhero genre's kinship to horror. \"Maybe I am a monster,\" a character admits. \"I'm not sure that I would know if I were one.\" Conversations and monologues consider the relationship between chaos and control, creation and destruction that drives not just action cinema but life itself. \"When the universe starts to settle,\" Ultron says, \"God throws a stone at it.\" Most surprising and welcome of all is the way Whedon builds criticism of\r\n the superhero genre's disinterest in property destruction and civilian \r\ncasualties (displayed most callously in \"Man of Steel\") \r\ninto the plot. \"Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the \r\nworld and destroying it,\" Scarlet Witch chides. \"Where do you think he \r\ngets that?\"\u00a0  Advertisement It\r\nwould be silly to position Marvel or Whedon or their fan army as underdogs. Once a niche genre, superhero films are now practically the official culture of the United States, and this entry will make a fortune no matter what anyone says about it. Still, I\r\nhope that even as people buy tickets out of habit,\r\nthey'll see that there is, in fact, art happening on the screen, maybe for\r\nthe first time since Marvel's march through American cinema started. \"Age of Ultron\" proves that a movie with stealth fighter jets,\r\nlevitating cities and Hulk-on-robot fisticuffs can be as freewheeling as a no-budget indie. It's a shame to think that this film will be dog-piled for its imperfections rather than applauded for trying to prove\r\nthat a seemingly inflexible genre can bend into strange and surprising shapes.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Miss Stevens", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "A low-key and intelligent character study, \u201cMiss Stevens\u201d\r\ndoesn\u2019t escape from its indie-film commonplaces often enough to become really\r\ndistinctive, but it has enough conscientiousness about its people that it\r\ndoesn\u2019t let the commonplaces fester into movie-sinking clich\u00e9s. Directed by\r\nJulia Hart (who scripted 2014\u2019s woman-centered Civil-War-set drama \u201cThe Keeping\r\nRoom\u201d) from a screenplay she co-wrote with Jordan Horowitz, it\u2019s an offhand\r\ntribute to teaching\u00ad\u2014its titular protagonist, played by Lily Rabe, is a\r\nhigh-school English teacher of obvious sensitivity, integrity and faith in her\r\ncalling. She\u2019s just having a tough time with, you know, life, and this picture\r\nworks to capture that in a purposeful way.  Advertisement The movie begins with the slight, attractive Rabe seated in\r\na theater, reluctant to leave after the lights have gone up. We find out what\u2019s\r\nthere for her, or rather what\u2019s not there, later on. Hart leaps headlong into\r\nMiss Stevens' weekend mission: to drive three students to an off-campus drama\r\ncompetition, where the kids will deliver monologues and perhaps bring home\r\nprizes that will get their school some arts funding. The kids are: the smart\r\nand slightly stuck-up Margot (Lili Reinhart) who on first impression seems to\r\nhave a little Tracy Flick in her; the openly-gay but not overtly theatrical\r\nabout it Sam (Anthony Quintal) and the troubled but also of course meteorically\r\ntalented Billy (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet). The road trip gets off to a rocky start as\r\nMargot criticizes Miss Stevens\u2019 taste in driving tunes, terming the stuff \u201cdad\r\nmusic.\u201d Billy digs it, and yes, this is one of those movies in which the\r\ncharacters bicker about a well-known pop tune and the filmmakers let you know\r\nwhere their loyalties lie by squelching the argument and letting the \u201cgood\r\npart\u201d of said tune play out at full volume on the soundtrack. I won\u2019t spoil the\r\nsong for you but it\u2019s not a favorite of mine.  By showing his affinity for Miss Stevens early on, Billy,\r\nwho\u2019s on meds and also is obliged to take a makeup exam some time over the\r\nweekend, first stakes his imaginary claim on her emotions. He figures they are\r\ntwo lonely people who can help each other, and Miss Stevens\u2019 possibly unwise\r\nconfession of a recent emotional episode eggs him on\u2014as does his unannounced\r\ndecision to get off those aforementioned meds. Much is made in contemporary art\r\nassessment of a creator\u2019s ostensible attitude toward his or her characters;\r\nspeculation on this topic is often irrelevant and/or stupid, but this movie\r\nmakes it plain that it truly likes its characters. One way it does so is in its\r\ndisinclination to get them into scrapes of any sort that are too uncomfortable\r\nor grotesque (this is arguably a more realistic approach as well, some might\r\nsay). All of which is to say that while Miss Stevens (Rachel to her\r\nnon-students) does make some bad\r\ndecisions (such as hooking up with a married male teacher played by Rob Huebel,\r\nwhose thirst for portraying schlubby cads seems unlikely to ever be slaked),\r\nshe insists on treating Bill as her student, and working things out with him\r\nthat way.  The film moves from scene to scene with a fluid ease, and\r\nthe acting is consistently winning and credible without ever being showy. While\r\nthe movie\u2019s unprepossessing manner can\u2019t be said to backfire, exactly, its\r\nmoments of wit and observation aren\u2019t sufficiently startling to lift it out of\r\nengaging amiability.

{"Title": "Hank and Asha", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Hank (Andrew Pastides) is handsome, outgoing, and romantic.\r\nAsha (Mahira Kakkar) is beautiful, sweet, and vulnerable. Who wouldn't want to watch them get together? James E. Duff\u2019s film\r\nabout these two immensely likable people starts with a found-footage conceit\r\nthat holds the potential to deconstruct what we know all too well about the\r\nromantic dramedy genre, giving viewers a unique take on a timeless tale. And\r\nyet as easy as it is to like Hank and Asha, it\u2019s impossible to look past the\r\nmany screenwriting and filmmaking flaws of the film about them. Advertisement \u201cHank and Asha\u201d consists of nothing but \u201cvideo letters\u201d from\r\nHank to Asha and Asha to Hank. Asha lives in Prague, where she sees a film by\r\nHank that she admires. She waits for the post-screening Q&A to meet the man behind the\r\nwork but he unexpectedly is forced to miss the meet & greet. And so Asha\r\ndoes something that might be slightly outside of her comfort zone: she sends\r\nsomeone she doesn\u2019t know a video introduction. Hank responds from his apartment\r\nin New York City. The two rather quickly (almost too much so to be realistic)\r\nopen up about their lives. Asha criticizes the lack of interior design in Hank\u2019s day-to-day, while Hank is often playful and silly, playing guitar or lip-syncing a dance\r\nroutine. The two form at least a supportive friendship, and possibly much more if they\r\nweren\u2019t separated by thousands of miles. Hank and Asha\u2019s relationship, which\r\nnever progresses to the Skype stage, goes through many of the ups and downs of\r\na physical one but would have been impossible just a technological generation\r\nago. The creative potential in the way that the physical\r\ndevelopment of technology has forever altered love,\r\npassion, and romance that Spike Jonze brilliantly mined in \"Her\" seems like the\r\nfoundation for a film built on video letters. Which is why the formulaic nature\r\nof Duff and Julia Morrison\u2019s script can be so frustrating. The structure of \u201cHank\r\nand Asha\u201d puts us right in the middle of what should be an intimate, personal,\r\norganic connection. Hank and Asha are speaking to each other but due to the\r\nnature of cinema, they are really speaking directly to the movie audience,\r\nconveying fears, concerns, and something at least approaching love. And yet\r\nDuff & Morrison waste the opportunity for true emotional connection on contrivance.  The first cinematic element that pushes \u201cHank and Asha\u201d closer\r\nto clich\u00e9 than reality is a matter of technical polish. Nothing here looks nearly\r\nDIY enough. Why is Asha opening a door\r\nto the already-on camera? Everything past the first few exchanges has the look\r\nof a VH1 music video. It\u2019s too well-framed, well-lit; yes, Hank is a filmmaker\r\nand Asha has an artist\u2019s eye, so I can give you that their videos may look\r\nbetter than average but why does she have a better editor than most Slamdance\r\nfilms? And when Duff and Morrison get to the \u201cpop stage\u201d, where they twice give\r\neach character a \u201cCoffee House\u201d track to adorn their montages, we\u2019ve reached\r\nthe point where it feels more like watching a Plain White T\u2019s music video than\r\nanything else.  Advertisement The script starts to reflect (or perhaps influence) the film\u2019s\r\noverly polished manner. Why do they so often respond via video message as if\r\nthey\u2019re talking to each other in conversation when we know they\u2019re not? She\r\nreveals something and Hank \u201cresponds\u201d with \u201cWhoa. Wow. That\u2019s huge.\u201d as if he\r\nhasn\u2019t had hours to think about it before preparing his response. Why not\r\nembrace the idea that modern technology would alter the romantic conversation\r\ninstead of pretending that we\u2019re in the middle of a dinner date? Use the form to put the viewer in a position that doesn't so often feel like a standard third wheel. \u201cHank and Asha\u201d\r\ntries to replicate the dating process through modern technology but fails to\r\ncomment on how said technology really changes their behavior (or even just to make the\r\ncase that it doesn\u2019t). Found footage has been a subgenre often reserved for horror\r\nfilms and yet the worst of them often fall into the same genre traps as their\r\non-film counterparts. The same fate befalls \u201cHank and Asha,\u201d a film with two\r\ngenuinely likable characters and performers that can\u2019t avoid the clich\u00e9s of the\r\ngenre it could have so easily deconstructed.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Enzo Avitabile Music Life", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In Enzo Avitabile's song \"Mane e Mane\", the chorus runs: \"All men know it is possible to live together hand in hand\", an eloquent summing-up of Avitabile's international outlook on life, as well as his attitude towards music. A jazz saxophonist and world-music composer, Avitabile is so famous in his native Naples that when he visits his childhood neighborhood, people cluster onto the balconies above to get a look at him, or clamor around him trying to get close. Jonathan Demme profiles and celebrates Enzo Avitabile in \"Enzo Avitabile Music Life\", the most recent entry in Demme's lengthening list of music documentaries.\u00a0 Advertisement Unlike his excellent Neil Young concert films, \"Enzo Avitabile Music Life\" feels strangely vague at times, as though Demme is still searching for a way to present his subject and hasn't quite worked it out yet. The film feels like a first draft. But then there is the music to celebrate: Demme films an elaborate jam session hosted by Avitabile and held in a gigantic stone church with musicians from all around the world. Those jam sessions are the reason to see the film.   Enzo Avitabile is an extroverted and interesting man, with wild hair, a keffiyeh around his neck (given to him by his daughter's Moroccan boyfriend), a dangling crucifix earring, and baggy nondescript clothes. He spills out his theories about the history of jazz (his knowledge is encyclopedic), shares his excitement with discovering Finale, a music notation software program that allowed him to compose entire symphonies and then listen to what he created, a maestro at a laptop.\u00a0 He lives buried in clutter, with 300 spiral-bound music scores piling up on shelves above his washing machine. He brags about one of his daughters who just had a scientific article published. He likes to start off the day listening to \"Stabat Mater\" by Giovanni Pergolesi. Avitabile is interested in what connects us, in what holds us together. The foot rhythms of dancers in Sudan and Tanzania have not been properly explored by composers, he thinks, same with rare Middle Eastern scales. The Mediterranean has always been a gigantic crossroads, and Avitabile is very aware of that cultural migration and blending.   The jam session in the church is the underlying structure of the film, the event which holds it all together. Musicians from Pakistan, Armenia, Mauritania, India, Iran, Iraq, Cuba, gather together to play Avitabile's songs. Many of them play bizarre instruments, rarely featured in orchestras, yet which have 3,000-year histories and traditions attached to them.\u00a0 Avitabile's songs are often laments about poverty and injustice, hatred and bigotry. Political in nature, they are cries for peace and understanding. He sings (and in one case does a gorgeous duet with Palestinian singer Amal Murkus) to the accompaniment of Flamenco guitar, sitar, Indian tabla drums, or the Iranian tar. The sound is phenomenal, haunting, catchy. The musicians play in a large round space, surrounded by columns and religious murals, the stone floor covered in overlapping Persian rugs. When filmed from overhead, the jam session takes on a ceremonial aspect. The musicians, often separated by a language barrier, communicate easily through the music. The collaboration is intense and joyous.\u00a0 Advertisement While Demme's camera follows Enzo on a trip down memory lane, and it is occasionally interesting, those sections were the least successful of the film. There are intriguing details dropped in our path, usually by Avitabile himself (for example, he lost his sight for a couple of years, and had to have two cornea transplants), but they remain unconnected fragments. We know he recorded with Tina Turner (a photo of the two of them dominates his study), but all we learn about that time in his life is that he appears to have converted to Buddhism, but then after his wife died he went back to what he calls \"his brand\" of Christianity. He is eloquent on James Brown and the way Brown's gospel roots morphed into a secular kind of devotion which Avitabile found inspiring. Avitabile is one of those people who can barely speak without saying something interesting, but the fragmentary nature of all the biographical stuff was frustrating, especially when compared to the great liveliness and intensity of the musical scenes.   Although Avitabile is so famous in his homeland that people shout out his name as he walks by, and although he has recorded with the likes of Tina Turner and James Brown, his name is not known to most American audiences. Demme's film, first draft though it may be, could change that.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Carnage Park", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"Carnage Park\" is the kind of movie where bullets only fly in slo-mo. It's the kind of movie where a head is blown into bits and the gore has become so rote you check your watch. Even considering a couple of good performances, effectively creepy monochromatic cinematography (Mac Fisken) and a nerve-jangling score by Giona Ostinelli, \"Carnage Park\" is an extremely empty experience. The narrative does not proceed in a linear fashion, one of its many nods to Quentin Tarantino: it leaps forward and back in time, following one character before moving onto another. First, there's a slightly incomprehensible monologue-voiceover, delivered by actor Pat Healy in the role of psycho Vietnam veteran Wyatt Moss who has created a \"carnage park\" in his massive piece of property out in the desert, where people get trapped so he can then pick them off one by one. (Pat Healy, so wonderful as the father in the recent \"Henry Gamble's Birthday Party,\" is barely recognizable here, down to the lunatic mix of blankness, enjoyment and intractability in his eyes.) Wyatt stalks around on his property, sometimes wearing a gas mask, and he is omniscient and omnipresent, assault weapon pointed at his targets from nearby hills or gullies. \"God doesn't play favorites,\" he drones. Advertisement Then there's a leap back, and the story really gets started as a gas-guzzling beat-up Chevrolet careens through the desert, a screaming man bleeding to death in the back seat, as the driver tells him to hang on. The panicked driver is Scorpion Joe (James Landry H\u00e9bert) and the shot guy on the back is Scorpion Joe's sidekick, Lenny (Michael Villar). Turns out they have a hostage in the trunk, a traumatized girl named Vivian (played by Ashley Bell, from \"The Last Exorcism\" films) Scorpion Joe and Lenny just robbed the tiny bank in the tiny nearby town, dragging Vivian, who was at the bank begging for a loan to save the family farm, along with them for collateral. Little does Scorpion Joe know that he's driven onto the land owned by a raging serial killer, the periphery lined with electric fences. Alan Ruck, the local sheriff, pays Wyatt a tense visit to ask about the recent disappearances of a couple of people. Wyatt, who patrols his land as though he lives at Area 51, won't allow the sheriff to take a look around. The brave Vivian eventually finds herself alone, staggering through an impressively vast and bleak landscape, trying to understand what she has stumbled into. There is a \"graveyard\" of beat-up rusting trucks, there's a record player in an empty dirt space playing a record warped in the sun, there are loudspeakers everywhere, blasting the sounds of Wyatt cackling with glee. No matter where she hides or what she finds, Wyatt is waiting, unseen. Ashley Bell conducts Vivian's growing realization of the hopelessness of her position like a maestro. It's not a one-note Scream-Queen performance. She starts off panicked and upset, begging for her life. She then erupts in screaming horror as she realizes her predicament, before then down-shifting into calculated and panicked planning to get herself out of there. It's a hell of a performance. Her small frame quivers with adrenaline, her arms stick out stiff at her sides, ready to defend whatever it is that might come at her. The look of the film, which takes place in 1978, is dusty, rusty and dry. The sky spreads above the carnage in a blast of white. When it gets dark, the darkness is total. There are one too many shots that pan down (or up) from the sky to the land and back, but the look is so unremittingly inhospitable that when Vivian finds a canteen of water, the whole film sighs with relief. Beloved character actor Larry Fessenden has a cameo, but overall the cast is small, and the majority of the film features Bell racing from one gory aftermath to another. Advertisement Wyatt Moss lives and breathes an End-times survivalist atmosphere, borne out of his experiences at the hands of the U.S government in the Vietnam war, as well as his anger at how veterans were treated once they returned. The dots don't quite connect, and his opening monologue\u2014something about how mental hospitals have released unstable veterans into the wild\u2014provides no illumination. The all-seeing serial killer has been so done to death that Wyatt Moss just seems \"same ol' same ol' psycho\" as opposed to a frightening anomaly of evil. The television show \"Criminal Minds\" is going on 12 seasons now, and the series' message is twofold: 1.) There is a serial killer under every rock in America. 2.) A woman who dares leave her house will probably find herself chained up in a sex dungeon. The 1932 film \"The Most Dangerous Game,\" based on the short story of the same name, features shipwrecked Joel McCrea having to hide from a lunatic Russian count who lives on the island and hunts the human beings who drift up on his shore. 2006's \"The Hills Have Eyes\" also features a desert, a psycho and people stranded there who are hunted for sport. There's nothing wrong with a director paying tributes to those influences he loves. But when you can practically see all of the items on the checklist being ticked off (Peckinpah, Tarantino, grindhouse, etc., check!), when you sense that that's all there is ... well, that's all there is.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Evolution of a Criminal", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "In 1997, 17-year old\u00a0Darius Clark Monroe robbed a bank and went to prison for it; then he went to NYU film school and made this movie about his life. The movie presents itself as an act of atonement, and an attempt by Monroe to understand himself and the social forces that drove him to a life of crime. Executive produced by Spike Lee, who was one of Monroe's professors at NYU, it's as assured a filmmaking debut as I've seen\u2014a genre-blurring work that has the content of a documentary but the hard-edged yet dreamy style of a crime picture by Michael Mann (\"Thief,\" \"Heat\") or Albert and Allen Hughes (\"Menace II Society,\" \"Dead Presidents\"). At the same time, though, there's something profoundly yet mysteriously off about it. The movie's off-ness puts an asterisk next to every superlative one could otherwise assign to it. Advertisement Monroe grew up in a Houston, Texas suburb, in a loving home overseen by a mother and father who had a peaceful and mutually supportive relationship and treated their children decently. Unfortunately, they were also a working class (sometimes the film hints at working poor) family, teetering on the edge of financial panic. Like a lot of working people, they toiled for long hours at very little pay, then spent nearly everything they earned to cover the basics and buy a few amenities, such as electronic equipment. Many Americans will empathize with this tenuous lifestyle, one in which a single devastating event can push a family over the brink into desperation. That event came in the form of a burglary. As described by Monroe, his family and their friends, it sounds diabolically inventive, like something a Michael Mann criminal might cook up: robbers snuck into the upstairs floor of the Monroe family home, cut a hole in the ceiling of Monroe's bedroom, dropped down through it and stole everything they could, including a week's worth of pay from a check that Monroe's father had cashed but not yet deposited. As the movie describes it, the robbery initiated a financial death spiral that led Monroe to hatch a scheme to steal large numbers of VCRs from the electronic store where he worked in receiving.\u00a0 One day he and his friends watched an episode of a true crime show about a bank robber, and figured that if a guy as dumb as the one on TV could knock over a bank, they could, too. He and his pals planned to rob a small, poorly secured bank branch during the second half of a school day, taking care to be sure they were marked as \"present\" at school so they'd have an alibi. One of Monroe's accomplices called in a bomb threat to the school to divert police attention from the crime they were about to commit. The young men made off with\u00a0$140,000 but were quickly caught. Monroe was tried as an adult but copped a plea bargain and did five years behind bars. Advertisement Technically, there isn't a scene, indeed a frame of this movie that feels less than expertly realized. It's filled with dramatic re-creations of the sort that Monroe probably absorbed from the true crime show that sparked his \"Eureka!\" moment\u2014it even opens with a dramatic re-creation of young Monroe being arrested by cops after the bank robbery and taken from school in handcuffs\u2014but they're all done in a hypnotic style that includes off-centered framing and emotionally expressive slow-motion.\u00a0 In an ordinary nonfiction film, these sequences might contrast awkwardly with the more straightforward interview sections, home video snippets, family photographs and other standard materials in the documentary toolkit. But Monroe and his collaborators have presented the other material in a similarly Mann-like style, so that the whole thing has a slightly cosmic vibe, sometimes bordering on horror or science fiction. When we see Monroe interviewing, say, his mother or father, or a bank customer who says that if he hadn't found Jesus when Monroe went to prison he would have probably attacked him if he'd run into him on the street, the content of the exchanges is innately powerful, but the style adds another layer of intensity, thanks to cinematographer Daniel Patterson's aggressively dynamic frames (he favors converging perspective lines), composer T. Griffin's trance-inducing synthesized score, and editor Doug Lenox's unpredictable cuts.\u00a0 What's missing is a sense of how Monroe, seemingly a law-abiding young man before his family's financial dark days, suddenly went from being a go-along-to-get-along type to a budding criminal mastermind. I'm not making a moral judgment call here: I've seen and read first person, true crime stories by a lot of people who did worse things than Monroe and found them fascinating as art or journalism. This is a storytelling issue. Some connective tissue is missing.\u00a0 Human history is filled with people who responded to sudden financial desperation by turning to crime, and some of them may even have stolen property from employers or tried to rob a bank. (\"The Dog,\" about the real-life petty criminal that \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is based on, is one such movie.) But there was always an escalation. The criminal started out doing relatively minor crimes and worked his way up to bigger ones. Here, Monroe presents himself as, simultaneously, a Walter White-type whose dormant criminal intelligence is activated by trauma, and (humbly) as a Jean Valjean type, stealing to help his family.\u00a0 But this is life, not fiction, and we're not talking about a loaf of bread here. It takes a bold and steely person to come up Monroe's VCR theft scheme, which was systematic and involved, and an even bolder, steelier person to mastermind a bank robbery while in high school. And the defense that he was only doing it to help his family doesn't really sync up with the complexity of the crimes we're told about. \u00a0It feels as though key information has been skipped over or left out, for reasons one cannot surmise based on the information that's been presented. In terms of character development, \"Evolution of a Criminal\" jumps from point A to point Z and leaves out the rest of the alphabet.\u00a0The title of the movie makes a promise that isn't delivered. The criminal part is brilliantly realized, but there's not enough evolution. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Kate Plays Christine", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Movie publicity is filled with buzzwords about acting, \"transformation\" in particular, but it's sad how little practical information we viewers get about that process. It's often wrapped up in mysticism or ignored entirely; we hear in the abstract that an actor trained as a boxer to play a boxer, or studied someone's accent in order to play a character of a different nationality or ethnicity, but there are precious few examples of what it actually means to enter another person's consciousness and become them for purposes of telling a story. \"Kate Plays Christine,\" about an actress preparing to play a newscaster who committed suicide in 1974, is a rare and welcome exception. But for all of its practical details about what the process of acting is actually about, it's more than a mere record of things done and said. It blurs the line between fact and fiction, to the point where it seems less of an account of real world events than a fact-fiction blur. The actress repeatedly tells us she is getting ready to play a role in the story of her character's life but we never see the finished film, because it's the film that you're watching. The process of transformation is the story, and the story truly belongs to the artist. Advertisement \"Kate Plays Christine\" is conceived and directed by Robert Greene, a film editor (mainly with director Alex Ross Perry) who is also an accomplished documentary filmmaker; his works all have an aspect of deliberate genre blurring, in particular \"Actress,\" about a performer putting her career on hold to take care of her family, and \"Fake it So Real,\" about small-time professional wrestlers in North Carolina. \"Kate\" focuses on Kate Lyn Sheil (\"House of Cards,\" \"Sun Don't Shine\"), who has been hired to play Christine Chubbuck, a Florida news reporter who is considered to be the first instance in the United States of a person killing herself live on the air: she shot herself in the back of the head during a broadcast and was taken to an emergency room, where she died.  This is a grim assignment, and Sheil treats it with all the gravity it deserves. As she (and we) study the details of Christine Chubbuck's short life, the movie gives us a sense of the wider context surrounding TV news in the 1970s, and the sexism that affected her professional and personal life. There is something both ghoulish and inspiring about the process of identification depicted here. We learn that Christine had an ovary removed a year before the suicide, and that she was in love with a coworker, a man who read stock market reports on the air, but was rejected by him. We also get a sense of Christine as an isolated and deeply depressed person whose symptoms went largely unrecognized; colleagues who talk about her in the present tense tend to frame her life in terms of the impact that her bloody death had on them, and describe her as simply a serious or \"dark\" person, rarely giving any indication that she was understood, much less than she had any kind of serious support network. Kate (it seems wrong to call her by her last name, because the movie is so intimate) begins the process of identification immediately, reading about the case, expressing both relief and dismay that no video exists of the suicide, and trying to study Christine's vocal mannerisms and posture and get her look right. An early highlight of the process finds Kate sitting with an elderly wigmaker, a widow, who tries to fit her with an approximation of Christine's long, dark locks. Although Kate doesn't really look much like Christine in the face\u2014and notice how the wigmaker compliments her on being so much prettier than the dead woman she's portraying\u2014as she puts on the wig something almost alchemical seems to happen. Greene's camera frames her alongside an image of Christine, and she seems to be turning into her, like the two women in Ingmar Bergman's \"Persona.\" Advertisement When actors talk about the adverse emotional effects of playing a dark character for any length of time, there's a tendency to roll our eyes at them, mainly because of the perception that acting (like filmmaking or writing or music) somehow isn't \"real\" work that exacts a different kind of emotional or physical toll. This film puts the lie to that belief. You see Kate becoming Christine, as the title promises, with all the downsides that transformation entails, and it's not always easy to look at. Much of the time it's genuinely disturbing. The film sometimes errs on the side of the same kind of mysticism that Kate's practical approach makes a point of rejecting\u2014there are perhaps too many ominous scenes of the actress being observed from middle distance while a synthesized score drones ominously\u2014but whenever the leading lady is talking to us and to herself, contemplating the work and what it means, the movie is riveting and unique.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Disorder", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Vincent is a French special forces soldier who has returned from Afghanistan. He has suffered acute hearing loss, and it is uncertain whether or not he can return to battle (which he wants to do). He also suffers from severe PTSD. He has a hard time distinguishing legitimate threats because everything seems threatening. His head is filled with buzzing and ringing from his damaged ear, and he often clamps his hands over his head, massaging it, trying to make the buzzing go away, trying to tamp down the internal chaos. Played by Matthias Schoenaerts, Vincent is a tormented and inarticulate man, and the riveting center of Alice Winocour's sexy, relentless thriller \"Disorder.\"\u00a0 Advertisement While he waits to be sent back to war, he and his army pals get jobs in a security detail, their first gig working a party at a mansion owned by a Lebanese businessman named Imad Whalid (Percy Kemp). Whalid lives there with his wife Jessie (Diane Kruger) and small son Ali (Za\u00efd Errougui-Demonsant). Television screens proliferate in every space, showing news anchors speculating about a growing political scandal involving international arms-dealing and French politicians that could topple governments and corporations. Vincent's just a soldier, albeit a highly trained one. He was sent to fight a war by those in power, the people at this very party. His health and his mind were wrecked for it, while those at home got to stay safe and oblivious. He has no say in how his country has used him, and then tossed him out. Vincent's sixth sense tells him that something is very wrong at that party, but he doesn't know what. Hand-picked by Whalid to guard Jessie and Ali while Whalid goes out of the country on business, Vincent settles into a new routine, strolling the grounds, checking locks, driving the wife and kid for an outing to the beach. Diane Kruger is lovely and fragile here, with spurts of sharpness, and an occasional imperious attitude towards Vincent. Vincent is almost shy with her, feeling the vast class differences between them. He has no problem bonding with the family dog, however (a nice touch, calling to mind Arthur Miller's comment to Peter Bogdanovich on why his late wife Marilyn Monroe got along so well with children and animals: \"They didn't sneer at her.\") From the first moment he saw Jessie, crying in a bedroom during the party, Vincent is intensely drawn to her. As shattered as he is, he is a natural protector. (Schoenaerts often plays such roles, most memorably in \"Bullhead\" and \"Rust and Bone.\" He's wonderful playing men bound up in muscles, unable to let loose their equally powerful tenderness. Schoenaerts' vulnerability as an actor leads him towards a rough and honest kind of truth.) As the film plunges into a home-invasion thriller, with mysterious cars parked at the end of the driveway and shadowy figures stalking the house, some viewers may feel they have seen it all before. But Winocour has such a unique approach to the familiar material that the clich\u00e9s (this is, after all, a genre film) are irrelevant. The entire story is told solely from Vincent's often-distorted point of view. Because of his considerable physical and emotional challenges, many of the sequences have a hallucinatory quality, starting with the party, where Vincent wanders through the crowd in slo-mo (the camera trailing along behind him, as it does throughout), the dance music's bass line throbbing, a sound Vincent feels, rather than hears. Vincent's brain, already flooded with excess adrenaline, cannot absorb what comes at him; he isn't sure if what he perceives is real or a phantom manifestation of war trauma. His confusion bleeds out into the audience. We question his reliability as a narrator. It's extremely effective. In a stunning sequence on the beach with Jessie and Ali, Vincent senses a threat, like an animal senses a predator approaching, even though it's as yet unseen. On high alert, he scans the benign landscape for what he knows is out there.\u00a0 Advertisement The sound design (by Nicolas Becker) is a show-stopper. It's omnipresent, forcing us into Vincent's head-space at all times. Everything is distorted and disorienting. Voices are fuzzed-out. Lawn sprinklers sound like Niagara Falls. A vacuum erupts into a roar. Brian De Palma's \"Blow Out\" instantly comes to mind, as well as Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation,\" stories with a similar obsession with sound as well as atmospheres of phantasmagorical political paranoia.\u00a0 There is wonderful, complex scene-work done by the actors, especially in one scene where Vincent's security buddy comes to the house, and flirts so easily with Jessie that Vincent looks on, uneasy and jealous. He's left out. Nothing is easy for Vincent. There's another scene, late in the game, where Jessie, who has by now spent more time with Vincent than her own husband, tells Vincent about how she could see him moving to Canada and living in the wild, that that was his true milieu. Vincent actually laughs, but Schoenaerts adds shyness, and surprise that anyone\u2014especially her\u2014gives him a second thought, sees a possible alternative for him, sees him at all. It's moments like that when Winocour, an extremely gifted director (who also co-wrote last year's stunning \"Mustang,\" another story about people trapped in a house), really shows her cards, what interests her. It's him.\u00a0 Schoenaerts is a major actor. He is such a strong physical presence that his best roles have utilized it explicitly, making his body and his size an integral part of the character. What makes him a great actor is that his sensitivity and subtle inventiveness (in terms of how psychological reality is revealed through behavior), is equal to the size of his body. His is not just a natural, instinctive gift. It's a smart actor at work, understanding that the most important thing is what's going on in his head. \"Disorder\" is tense and scary, beautiful to look at and even more gorgeous to hear. In the end, it is also extremely moving. That's the most thrilling part of all.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Most Hated Woman in America", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\u201cMy mother pissed off a lot of people, especially those she was close to.\u201d There\u2019s an undeniable wealth of storytelling to be culled from the life of Madalyn Murray O\u2019Hair, a talk show regular and fighter for religious freedom who was kidnapped in the \u201890s and held for ransom. She fought back against what she saw as the hypocrisy of a religious community that shunned her after a second pregnancy as a single woman, starting a legal battle to remove prayer from schools and the words \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance. Realizing she could make a profit as an anti-religious leader, she founded American Atheists, getting donations large enough to make her rich, and a target of those who wanted her cash. She was once called \"The Most Hated Woman in America,\u201d and the Netflix Original that tries to tell her story takes that name as well. I said tries because you have learned about as much reading this intro as you will about Madalyn Murray O\u2019Hair in the course of this disappointing, narratively flat film. Advertisement Melissa Leo plays the controversial figure, although she\u2019s often forced to fight through bad, old-age makeup to convey character. We see Madalyn at several key points in her life, but the majority of the film focuses on the kidnapping in August of 1995 by David Waters (Josh Lucas), Gary Karr (Rory Cochrane) and Danny Fry (Alex Frost), a trio of guys who just wanted to get $1 million and head for the border. To say it didn\u2019t go well would be an understatement. Oddly, no one seemed to care that Madalyn, her son Jon (Michael Chernus) and her granddaughter Robin (Juno Temple) were gone. Murray O\u2019Hair had pulled publicity stunts in the past, so the cops didn\u2019t investigate her disappearance, even though her ally Roy (Brandon Mychal Smith) knew that she wouldn\u2019t leave her beloved dogs at home.  Rob went to the press, getting in touch with San Antonio reporter Jack Ferguson (Adam Scott), who agreed that something didn\u2019t look right, and started publishing stories about the Murray O\u2019Hair disappearance. This \u201cinvestigative\u201d thread is used narratively to allow us into flashbacks about key moments in Madalyn\u2019s life, like her activism for religious freedom and the estrangement from her son Bill Jr. (Vincent Kartheiser), who now runs a fight for religious inclusion in the school system. Perhaps most bizarrely, director Tommy O\u2019Haver uses a lot of clips from Murray O\u2019Hair appearances, such as when she popped up on \u201cDonahue\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.\u201d A 90-minute film should never include this much recreated footage you could find online. The fact is that O\u2019Haver and co-writer Irene Turner never settle on an angle from which to tell this story. The history of Madalyn\u2019s life has a direct, then-this-happened biopic style. The film in which Adam Scott appears has a totally different tone, almost an outsider look at a crazy movie that could have worked on its own. And then there\u2019s the most frustrating film of all, the kidnapping tale that feels like it needed to have dark comedy elements like \u201cFargo\u201d or \u201cBernie\u201d but just comes off as flat and manipulative. Oh, I forgot one film\u2014the story of an estranged son. This is the most bizarrely melodramatic arc, as if O\u2019Haver thought it would add emotion to a story, but he doesn\u2019t have enough time to devote to it for it to register beyond a cautionary tale on how not use a manipulative score. Advertisement Clearly, any one of these films might have worked. Make the kidnappers the protagonists and tell the story of a trio of ne\u2019er-do-wells who stumble into a life-changing crime. Make the journalist the protagonist, and procedurally show us how he solved the kidnapping the police ignored. You could even tell the life story of the O\u2019Hairs in a way that focuses on her family, and ends with the headline-grabbing kidnapping. You simply can\u2019t tell all of these stories effectively in a 90-minute movie and give viewers any sort of character or insight. It results in a film that is simultaneously too much and nothing at all because it\u2019s jumping around so much narratively. And none of this haphazard storytelling is helped by a complete lack of visual language.  Through it all, a few performances actually increase the disappointment, for one wishes they were in a better film. Leo is perfect casting as a woman whose acerbic personality helped define her. Every time I see Josh Lucas, I wish he was in more movies, and he uses his physically imposing presence here in a way he\u2019s not often allowed to. And then there\u2019s Adam Scott, increasingly one of those actors who makes everything better. At one point, he says, \u201cI thought there might be a story here.\u201d There is, but \u201cThe Most Hated Woman in America\u201d doesn\u2019t really tell it.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Raze", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "If \"Raze\" had been released in 1975, Quentin Tarantino would never shut up about it. He still might not shut up about it because it stars Zoe Bell, the New Zealand stuntwoman who doubled for Uma Thurman in the \"Kill Bill\" films and clung to the hood of Stuntman Mike's car in \"Death Proof.\" Directed by Josh C. Waller from a screenplay by Robert Beaucage, this tale of captive women fighting to the death\u00a0has the poker-faced craziness of a 1970s or early '80s midnight flick, the kind that made audiences howl for blood.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Raze\" starts with an obvious fake-out, making you think it's about another character when it's obviously about Sabrina, whose raging face adorns the film's poster. A young woman (Rachel Nichols) wakes up on the floor of the dungeon following a one-night stand with a hunky guy she picked up in a bar, wanders the prison halls and runs into Sabrina, who fights and kills her in a close-quarters confrontation filmed in Jason Bourne whiplash-cam.  Then it's on to the premise, the characters and their backstories. The prison is a family-run institution that's pitted women against each other for generations. The guards are male, the prisoners female. The current jailers are a creepy, ostentatiously moralistic married couple (Sherilyn Fenn and Doug Jones) who dote on each other when they aren't berating the prisoners for their sins. The inmates all have experience fighting, professionally or otherwise. Most studied martial arts for self-defense; the wiseass Phoebe, played like a sneering Lee Marvin villain by Rebecca Marshall, has been physically and sexually abused since childhood. The jailers compel the women by threatening their loved ones, images of whom are piped in via closed-circuit TV. These human insurance policies have no idea they're being monitored, much less marked for death.  The best genre movies create their own reality, then fill it with situations compelling enough that the viewer is rarely distracted by what Alfred Hitchcock called \"refrigerator logic.\" How did the jailers successfully kidnap so many strong women? Why are the women conventionally beautiful enough to be catalog models? Do the jailers buy their sweatpants in bulk? You don't ask such questions of \"Raze\" because it's a dream logic movie comprised of bits and pieces of other dream logic movies: \"Battle Royale,\" the Hunger Games series, \"The Most Dangerous Game,\" a smidgen of \"Fight Club,\" a dollop of \"Oldboy.\" The characters are sketched with two or three details, then filled in by the actors' furiously physical performances. In place of a standard three-act structure, \"Raze\" is presented as a series of bouts joined by thin strands of dramatic connective tissue. Onscreen fight cards tell you who's up next.  Of course \"Raze\" begs to be read as allegory, perhaps for the way patriarchal society treats women as objects, entertainments, prisoners or slaves, pits them against one another for the prize of male approval, and pressures them to conform to limiting roles: girlfriend, wife, mother, tramp. Tantalizing fragments of meaning ricochet in the film's margins, but they never freeze long enough to let you look at them.  That's probably for the best. \"Raze\" is not an especially political or even introspective work, though it sometimes poses as one. If its direction and fight choreography were a more imaginative\u2014if each showdown had a strikingly different look, or were built around a different concept, as in Tarantino's \"Kill Bill\" movies\u2014it might have been a classic of sorts. Instead it's a solid feature with a few inspired moments. Its dark virtues are visceral and emotional: the amped-up sound effects of heels and knuckles bruising flesh and cracking bone; the intelligence in Sabrina's eyes as she plots against her jailers; the weirdly powerful confrontation between two combatants, one of whom tries to psych out her opponent by repeatedly asking her, \"How's your mother?\"  Advertisement This is a women's prison picture, but not the kind you're thinking of. There are no rape scenes or shower scenes. Moments in which men intimidate or overpower women are about bulk and intensity, not sexual terrorism. \"Raze\" doesn't objectify its female fighters any more than the Olympics objectify their athletes. Its women are posed and shot like hounded Amazons, and the director gives every major character a spot-lit pirouette; the best finds Marshall taunting future adversaries in the cellblock hall, then stepping through an entryway and giving the finger\u2014to the viewer, or so it seems\u2014before the doors slide shut. The female characters are gladiators. Sabrina is Spartacus in a tank top.  Bell's performance is the best reason to see \"Raze.\" She's just right as Sabrina, a strong-silent type in Steve McQueen-Clint Eastwood mode. The character mangles adversaries with her fists, feet, forehead and thumbs, but Bell's most fascinating moments are quiet ones where you watch her Hellenic face in close-up, thinking. How was this actress not cast as Wonder Woman? Can anything be done to remedy this injustice?", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Trumped: Inside the Greatest Political Upset of All Time", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "This hastily thrown-together documentary was a late addition to this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival and premieres tonight on Showtime, likely trying to get on the air before Donald Trump has done enough to warrant a sequel or two. It\u2019s true that so much has happened on the national scene in just the last ten days that \u201cTrumped: Inside the Greatest Political Upset of All Time\u201d already feels a bit dated. Remember Jeb Bush? Remember the debates? Remember Election Night? Of course you do, and \u201cTrumped\u201d plays way too much like a highlight reel from the last year, offering not nearly enough insight into the questions surrounding Trump\u2019s campaign and now-Presidency. This is more of a movie that chronicles that he won, not how he won\u2014those are two very different things. Just in the chronicling, a few interesting tidbits and insights come forward, but it was likely too soon to make this movie, as we don\u2019t fully comprehend what happened in the Election Year of 2016 quite yet. There will be a great documentary about it eventually. This will do until then. Advertisement \u201cTrumped\u201d came about as a collection of footage from Showtime\u2019s \u201cThe Circus,\u201d a show about the political process, featuring John Heilemann, Mark Halperin and Mark McKinnon. Directors Ted Bourne, Mary Robertson and Banks Tarver went through the thousands of hours of footage from that show to form it into a documentary focused on Trump\u2019s campaign. The problem is that there\u2019s a lot of story to tell here, and \u201cTrumped\u201d tries to hit all of the major points. So, we get his announcement, his battles with each of the GOP candidates, each of his controversies, the debates, and his inevitable win\u2014all in straightforward, then-this-happened fashion. When the people behind the show offer insight into how Trump is handling issues or how the media is handling him, \u201cTrumped\u201d comes to life. But that\u2019s simply not often enough to recommend it. So what does one learn from \u201cTrumped\u201d? One interesting thing is how much the film defies the idea that A) Trump never really wanted to be President and B) He ever thought he was going to lose. Call it ego if you will, but the Trump captured here always wanted the presidency (and there\u2019s interesting interview footage in which he discusses politics from as far back as 1980) and knew his approach was going to get him there. Trump\u2019s greatest victory was in realizing that he was the first president that didn\u2019t need the media as a go-between, and so he could use them as he saw fit (and he\u2019s still doing that, for the record). He could go straight to his base, either through Twitter or at rallies, and that allowed him to galvanize people in a way politics had never seen before. He also knew more about branding than any politician before him, understanding that things like \u201cLyin Ted,\u201d \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d would work. There a couple of interesting interviews aboard Trump\u2019s plane in which his act feels a little different, and we see a side we didn\u2019t often this past year. There\u2019s some footage at the Javits Center in the final minutes about how Hillary wants to heal the nation that her supporters and those inflamed over actions already taken by the administration will find depressing. Most interesting are the interviews with Roger Stone, a close ally of Trump\u2019s, who\u2019s writing a book called The Making of a President 2016. He not only understands Trump, but understands how to get him to the people. I would have liked more of that behind-the-scenes \u201cWar Room\u201d-esque material and less re-assembling of footage we\u2019ve already seen. It\u2019s 82 minutes into the film before we really get into a conversation about what a Trump victory means\u2014how did it work? What did he tap into? They mention that this victory was a seismic change in politics, but \u201cTrumped\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to fully understand how it happened. The ground is still shaking to such a degree that I\u2019m not sure any of us do yet. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}

But the surprises usually don\u2019t violate the (admittedly loose) internal logic of the universe George Lucas invented, and when they seem to, it\u2019s because the movie has expanded the mythology in a small but significant way, or imported a sliver of something from another variant of Lucas\u2019 creation (Genddy Tartakovsky\u2019s magnificent TV series \u201cClone Wars\u201d seems to have influenced the last act). \u00a0    Advertisement The first part of \u201cThe Last\u00a0Jedi\u201d cross-cuts between the remnants of our heroes\u2019 ragtag fleet (led by the late Carrie Fisher\u2019s Leia) running away from the First Order, aka the next-generation version of the Empire; and Rey (Daisy Ridley) on the aquatic planet Ahch-To (gesundheit!) trying to convince the self-exiled Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, whose sandblasted face becomes truly iconic in close-ups) to overcome his grief at failing a group of young Jedi trainees and rejoin the Resistance.

The leathery old coot may not be a great bad guy\u2014he\u2019s too much of a standard-issue deep-voiced sadist, in a Marvel mode\u2014but he is quite the chess player, and so is Johnson.   \u00a0    I\u2019m being vague here on purpose. Suffice to say that, despite being comprised of variations on things we\u2019ve been experiencing directly (in \u201cStar Wars\u201d films) and indirectly (in \u201cStar Wars\u201d-inspired entertainment) since 1977, \u201cThe Last\u00a0Jedi\u201d still manages to maneuver in unexpected ways, starting with the decision to build a whole film around a retreat where the goal is not to win but to avoid being wiped out.   Along that narrative backbone \u201cThe Last\u00a0Jedi\u201d strings what amount to several tight, often hastily devised mini-missions, each of\u00a0which either moves the heroes (or villains) closer to their goals or blows up in their faces. The story resolves in lengthy, consecutive climaxes which, refreshingly, don\u2019t play like a cynical attempt to pad things out. Old business is resolved, new business introduced.  And from scene to scene, Johnson gives veteran characters (Chewbacca and R2-D2 especially) and those who debuted in \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d enough screen time to showcase them at their best while also introducing compelling new faces (including a heroic maintenance worker, Kelly Marie Tran\u2019s Rose Tico; a serene and tough vice admiral in the Resistance, played by Laura Dern; a sort of \u201csafecracker\u201d character played by Benicio Del Toro).\u00a0    \u201cJedi\u201d does a better job than most sequels of giving the audience both\u00a0what it wants and\u00a0what it didn\u2019t know it wanted.\u00a0The movie leans hard into sentiment, most of it planted in the previous installment, some related to the unexpected passing of one of its leads (Fisher\u2014thank goodness they gave her a lot of screen time here, and thrilling things to do). But whenever it allows a character to cry (or invites us to) the catharsis feels earned. It happens rather often\u2014this being a film preoccupied with grieving for the past and transcending it, populated by hounded and broken people who are afraid hope will be snuffed out.\u00a0  Advertisement Rey\u2019s anguish at not knowing who her parents are and Kylo Ren\u2019s trauma at killing his own father to advance toward his \"destiny\" literally as well as figuratively mirror each other. Lifting a bit of business glimpsed briefly in \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d and \"Return of the Jedi,\" Johnson lets these all-powerful characters telepathically \u201cspeak\u201d to each other across space as easily as you or I might Skype with a friend. This gimmick offers so much potential for drama and wry humor that you might wonder why nobody did it earlier.\u00a0    Sometimes \"The Last\u00a0Jedi\" violates our expectations in a cheeky way that stops short of telling super-fans to get over themselves. There\u2019s a touch of \u201cSpaceballs\u201d and \u201cRobot Chicken\u201d to some of the jokes. Snoke orders Kylo to \u201ctake off that ridiculous helmet,\u201d Luke chastises an old friend for showing a nostalgic video by muttering \u201cThat was a cheap move,\u201d and an early gag finds one of the heroes calling the bridge of a star destroyer and pretending to be stuck on hold. This aspect adds a much-needed dash of self-deprecating humor (\u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d was often a stitch as well, especially when Han Solo, Chewbacca, BB-8 and John Boyega\u2019s James Garner-like hero/coward Finn were onscreen), but without going so meta that \"The Last\u00a0Jedi\" turns into a smart-alecky thesis paper on itself.  The movie works equally well as an earnest adventure full of passionate heroes and villains  and a meditation on sequels and franchise properties. Like \u201cThe Force Awakens,\u201d only more so, this one is preoccupied with questions of legacy, legitimacy and succession, and includes multiple debates over whether one should replicate or reject the stories and symbols of the past. Among its many valuable lessons is that objects have no worth save for the feelings we invest in them, and\u00a0that\u00a0no\u00a0individual\u00a0is greater than a noble idea. Advertisement Johnson has made some very good theatrical features, but the storytelling here owes the most to his work on TV\u2019s \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d a playfully convoluted crime drama that approached each new installment with the street illusionist\u2019s panache: the source of delight was always in the hand you weren\u2019t looking at. There are points where the film appears to have miscalculated or made an outright lame choice (this becomes worrisome in the middle, when Dern\u2019s Admiral Holdo and Oscar Isaac\u2019s hotshot pilot Poe Dameron are at loggerheads), but then you realize that it was a setup for another payoff that lands harder because you briefly doubted that \u201cThe\u00a0Last\u00a0Jedi\u201d does, in fact, know what it\u2019s doing.\u00a0    This determination to split the difference between surprise and inevitability is encoded in \u201cThe Last\u00a0Jedi\u201d down to the level of scenes and shots. How many Star Destroyers, TIE fighters, Imperial walkers, lightsabers, escape pods, and discussions of the nature of The Force have we seen by now? Oodles. But Johnson manages to find a way to present the technology, mythology and imagery in a way that makes it feel new, or at least new-ish, starting with a shot of Star Destroyers materializing from hyperspace in the sky over a planet (as seen from ground level) and continuing through images of Rebel ships being raked apart by Imperial cannon fire like cans on a shooting range and, hilariously, a blurry video conference in which the goggle-eyed warrior-philosopher Maz Kanata (voiced by Lupita Nyong'o) delivers important information while engaging in a shootout with unseen foes. (She calls it a \u201cunion matter.\u201d)\u00a0 There\u2019s greater attention paid here to color and composition than in any entry since \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back.\u201d Particularly dazzling are Snoke\u2019s throne room, with its Dario Argento-red walls and red-armored guards, and the final battle, set on a salt planet whose flat white surfaces get ripped up to reveal shades of crimson. (Seen from a distance, the battlefield itself seems to be bleeding.) The architecture of the action sequences is something to behold. A self-enclosed setpiece in the opening space battle is more emotionally powerful than any action sequence in any blockbuster this year, save the \"No Man's Land\" sequence of \"Wonder Woman,\" and it's centered on a character we just met. \u00a0 Advertisement There are spots where the film can\u2019t figure out how to get the characters to where it needs them to be and just sort of shrugs and says, \u201cAnd then this happened, now\u00a0let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d But there are fewer such moments than you might have gone in prepared to forgive\u2014and really, if that sort of thing were a cinematic crime, Howard Hawks would have gotten the chair. Most importantly, the damned thing moves, both in a plot sense and in the sense of a skilled choreographer-dancer who has visualized every millisecond of his routine and practiced it to the point where grace seems to come as easily as breathing.

{"Title": "Barracuda", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "An unexpected guest comes to call. There's something \"off\" about the guest. People\u2014socialized to be polite\u2014ignore the red flags, ignore the spidey-sense of something not being right. They think uneasily, \"Maybe we're just being paranoid.\" And so they invite the guest to come inside. If \"The Babadook\" taught us nothing else, it's that once you let that thing in, you'll never get rid of it. \"Barracuda,\" co-directed by Julia Halperin and Jason Cortlund (\"Now, Forager\") is a sometimes-riveting \"take\" on the uninvited guest plot-line, grounded to the earth by the phenomenal performances of Allison Tolman and Sophie Reid, playing half-sisters getting to know one another for the first time. \"Barracuda\" is as much about the ebb and flow of tension, suspicion and uneasiness surging in the space between these two women as it is \"about\" anything else. Even though other characters appear from time to time, \"Barracuda\" is a two-hander, with one extraordinary scene after another (the script was written by Cortlund). There are times when it's difficult to even locate the source of the uneasiness, the sense of increasing emotional danger. This forces the audience into complicity, where we, too, ignore our spidey-sense, our instincts. Maybe we're being paranoid, narrow-minded. Shouldn't you be kind to guests, especially one who's so hard up, especially one who's a long-lost family member? \"Barracuda\" says \"Not so fast ... \" Advertisement The opening sequence of the film shows Sinaloa (Reid) swimming in a river, fully clothed, with a huge factory looming in the distance. Next, we see her hitching rides across America, destination unknown. With her poker-straight hair down to her hips, battered jeans, flowy tops, she looks like she could have emerged from the late 1960s, a lost flower child in search of her tribe. She eats food out of dumpsters, splashes water under her arms in truck stop bathrooms. We learn about Sinaloa only from watching what she does (this remains true throughout). On her arrival in Austin, she shows up at the house of her half-sister Merle (Tolman). Up until that moment, Merle was unaware of Sinaloa's existence. Their father, now dead, was a well-known country singer who impregnated Sinaloa's mother during a tour of England. According to Sinaloa, he kept in regular contact, and even visited on occasion until all contact suddenly ceased. Sinaloa's arrival throws Merle\u2014and Merle's fiance Raul (Luis Bordonada)\u2014into barely suppressed chaos. Merle does not embrace her long-lost sister with open arms. She's put off by Sinaloa's matter-of-fact attitude. What does Sinaloa want? Money? Acknowledgement that she's part of the family? Against her better judgment, and at Raul's gentle insistence, Merle invites Sinaloa to stay with them until she can find a place to live.\u00a0 Merle lives a complacent life, busily planning her wedding (all under the watchful eye of her mother, a wonderful JoBeth Williams). Sinaloa does not exhibit the ingratiating behavior one would expect from a newcomer in an established family group. A singer-songwriter herself, she joins a sing-along around the campfire at a family gathering, dominating with her powerful and clear voice, and with her ability to keep up with the guitar-playing geezers, who all seem delighted by her. Merle looks on, jealousy and discomfort struggling for possession of her face. Although she never says it, it's clear from Sinaloa's aggressive behavior, the sly almost triumphant looks constantly thrown Merle's way, that Sinaloa is more their father's daughter than Merle ever was. Or is Merle just being paranoid and petty?\u00a0 It's a bold choice to place someone as unlikable as Sinaloa at the center of a film. She's fascinatingly\u00a0unlikable. We probably all have known someone like Sinaloa, the kind of woman who dominates a room even when she's silent. A fearless extrovert, she takes what she wants. She shovels the food Merle prepares into her mouth. When Raul tries to clear her plate, she grabs onto it, snapping \"I'm not done.\" A little smile flickers on her lips when things get awkward. Her competitiveness is clouded by plausible deniability. She disturbs the atmosphere just by walking into the room. Her walk is distinctive, a barreling pushing-forward stride. If you saw her coming at you, you might wince in preparation. Any impulse towards softening the character, or explaining her, has been avoided. In many ways Sinaloa reminded me of Sandrine Bonnaire's unforgettable character in Agn\u00e8s Varda's \"Vagabond.\" Varda gave the brilliant Bonnaire only a couple pieces of direction, the most important one being: \"Never ever say Thank you.\" Sinaloa never says \"thank you\" for anything. It doesn't even seem to occur to her. Sophie Reid's performance as Sinaloa is a refreshing corrective in a world where \"relatable\" and \"likable\" has come to equal \"good.\" Tolman is equally impressive as a woman leading an orderly and satisfying life, whose psyche starts to deteriorate with every passing moment in Sinaloa's destabilizing presence.\u00a0 Advertisement Halperin and Cortlund (and cinematographer Jonathan Nastasi) make some distinct visual choices in their approach to Sinaloa early on. Often, they film her as a blur, moving through the background or\u2014even creepier\u2014in the foreground. The world around her is in focus, yet she is indistinct, an abstract smudge. Sinaloa is seen doing very strange things as a blur in the background, while the people in the foreground go about their lives, unaware. It's tremendously disturbing.\u00a0 Some of the turns taken in \"Barracuda\" disappoint, as the film moves into more predictable genre territory. A couple of the major set-pieces later on are presented as terrifying climaxes in a thriller. But nothing in those scenes is scarier than the moment when Sinaloa stands on a lawn staring through a picture window at Merle and Merle's mother talking about wedding dresses. The two women in the foreground are in focus, and Sinaloa is a blur, but her energy is so wild and full of rage that it could probably shatter that window. If Merle and her mother turned around, they would scream, even though Sinaloa isn't doing anything violent. She's just standing there. Who is she? What does she want? When someone shows up on your doorstep, a family member who has no home, you are expected to take them in. \"Barracuda\" turns that on its ear.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Genius", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "About 25 years ago I met a fine artist, a painter, on a\r\ntrain trip to visit a mutual friend. We discussed our respective professions/enthusiasms,\r\nand she told me that as a rule she hated movies about painters because they\r\nwere almost uniformly false\u2014to the point of being corny\u2014in their depiction of\r\nthe act of painting. One exception, she said, was the then-recent \u201cLife Lessons,\u201d\r\nthe Martin-Scorsese-directed episode of the 1989 \u201cNew York Stories,\u201d in which\r\nNick Nolte played an abstract painter. That movie got it, she said. I was glad\r\nto hear it, as I enjoyed the movie too, but I also said that as someone who had\r\nlittle clue about how painting was actually accomplished, I could enjoy\r\nVincente Minnelli\u2019s \u201cLust For Life\u201d regardless.  Advertisement Writers have less of a hard time with movies about writers,\r\nbecause the act of writing is something that\u2019s somewhat pointless to depict\r\nvisually, so you kind of can\u2019t go wrong. But there\u2019s also a kind of inherent\r\nfutility in using a visual medium to convey the interior machinations of the\r\ncreative act. It\u2019s helpful, then, in concocting movies about writers, to choose\r\nor create writers who are oversized personalities, men and women who do a lot\r\nmore than spend time hunched over a desk wrestling with their own thoughts. The\r\nmovie \u201cGenius,\u201d directed by Michael Grandage from a script by John Logan, does\r\nnot lack for those. The central figure, though, is not a writer but an editor,\r\nthe real-life Maxwell Perkins, a man whose most pronounced eccentricity, it\r\nseems, involved almost never taking his hat off. \u201cGenius\u201d is the story of book\r\nman Perkins, friend and collaborator to the likes of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott\r\nFitzgerald, who play significant roles here, and the way Perkins took on and\r\ntamed the fiery poetic work of North-Carolina-born visionary (or blowhard,\r\ndepending on which literary critic you consult) Thomas Wolfe.  Perkins is\r\nplayed with reserve, hidden warmth, and scrupulous intelligence by Colin Firth,\r\nwhile Wolfe\u2019s role goes to Jude Law, who is more than well suited to declaim\r\nand thunder and be completely madly unreasonable in time-tested crazed-genius\r\nstyle. Perkins spends his days in the very woody offices of Scribner\u2019s,\r\nred-penciling such future masterpieces as \u201dA Farewell To Arms.\u201d In the evening\r\nhe takes the train home to a handsome secluded home where wait his wife and\r\nfive lovely, literate daughters. One day his office receives a ragged manuscript\r\nthat\u2019s more stack than sheaf. \u201cO Lost,\u201d it is titled, and the words that follow\r\nthat title, about the \u201clost wandering lonely souls,\u201d somehow grip the taciturn\r\nPerkins. When Wolfe drops in at Perkins\u2019 office, the writer is so cluelessly\r\neffusive that Perkins can barely get a word in edgewise, not even to tell him\r\nthat Scribner\u2019s is accepting the oft-rejected novel. The movie then spends a\r\nlittle while simulating how writer and editor honed down the stack to create\r\nwhat would come to be called \u201cLook Homeward, Angel.\u201d If you have\r\nany feel for writing, and I suppose if you particularly have any feel for\r\nWolfe\u2019s writing, you\u2019ll find the exchanges between editor and author\r\nexhilarating. Logan\u2019s script, based on A. Scott Berg\u2019s biography of Perkins, is\r\ninvested in the craft of words like few other movies nowadays, even those ostensibly about\r\nwriters. And if you have no particular concern for\r\nwriting, the emotional drama is not insignificant. Nicole Kidman plays Aline\r\nBernstein, a married woman who\u2019s Wolfe\u2019s lover and unofficial patron, and her\r\nscorn upon seeing her place in Wolfe\u2019s life become supplanted on account of\r\nPerkins\u2019 presence commands attention. As for Perkins, Wolfe starts looking like\r\nthe son he and wife Louise (Laura Linney) very clearly tried for but never had.\r\nAs success goes to Wolfe\u2019s head, though, Perkins gets inklings that he may have\r\ncreated an ego monster, while Wolfe himself insists that Perkins loosen up and\r\nfollow him to the places where he finds \u201cthe dark rhythms that inspire me.\u201d As\r\nfor Hemingway (Dominic West) and Fitzgerald (Guy Pearce), they make their concern and/or disapproval known\r\nfrom the sidelines.  Advertisement It could be\r\nthat I see so many dumb movies these days that I\u2019m inclined to cut a lot of\r\nslack for one of conspicuous intelligence, but I greatly enjoyed \u201cGenius.\u201d To\r\nthe extent that it\u2019s made me interested in checking out more Wolfe, who I\u2019ve\r\navoided like the plague since not enjoying his dialect short story \u201cOnly The\r\nDead Know Brooklyn.\u201d  I\u2019m not the\r\nonly one who was at least slightly taken aback, though, by a persistent quirk\r\nin the movie\u2019s casting, which is that not one of the Lions of American\r\nLiterature in this picture was played by, well, an American. Firth is British,\r\nLaw is British, Dominic West is British, Guy Pearce is Australian and so is Nicole Kidman. \u201cWhat about Zelda Fitzgerald,\r\nyou sexist?\u201d I can hear somebody saying. Well, yeah. She IS depicted in the\r\nmovie also. By Vanessa Kirby. A British actor. They all do\r\ntheir jobs pretty splendidly though so I can\u2019t really complain. But I did\r\nnotice.

{"Title": "Manchester by the Sea", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Manchester by the Sea,\" about a self-punishing, depressive loner (Casey Affleck) who slowly comes back to life after enduring a series of brutal losses, is the funniest movie about grief ever made. But that's far from the only remarkable thing about it. This film by playwright turned filmmaker Kenneth Lonergan contains multitudes of emotions, people and ideas, in such abundance that if you ask somebody to describe it, you should probably take a seat first.  It's a story about the complexity of forgiveness\u2014not just forgiving other people who've caused you pain, but forgiving yourself for inflicting pain on others. It's a story about parenting, of the biological, foster and improvised kind. And it's a portrait of a tightly knit community that depends mainly on one industry, fishing, and that has evolved certain ways of speaking, thinking, and feeling. And\u2014perhaps the biggest paradox in a movie filled with them\u2014it's a full-blown melodrama, packed with the sorts of events that a silent filmmaker might hesitate to jam into one film for fear of being accused of overdoing it, and yet the characters are so emotionally guarded, at times emotionally constipated, that they rein the movie in and stop it from becoming too much.  Advertisement Affleck, a specialist at playing reticent, somewhat mysterious men, plays Lee Chandler, a loner who lives in a cruddy basement apartment in Boston and works as a janitor. The death of his beloved older brother Joe (Kyle Chandler, seen in many generous flashbacks) saddles him with the unexpected responsibility of raising Joe's only son Patrick (Lucas Hedges, Redford from \"Moonrise Kingdom\"). Patrick's mother Elise (Gretchen Mol, also introduced in flashbacks) is a drug addict who's been out of the family picture for a long time. Lee despises her and is annoyed to learn that Patrick talks to her regularly and holds no grudge against her. Although Lee's affection for Patrick is well established, starting with the opening scene of grade school-aged Patrick clowning around with Lee on the deck of Joe's boat, it's a mystery to the community why Joe thought such a troubled man would be the ideal candidate to raise his only child. Lee is quiet, depressed, antisocial, a hard drinker, and inclined to fight strangers in bars. He hasn't seen his ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams) in years, and any time he ventures into Manchester, his old neighbors either whisper about him or glare at him.  While it's abundantly obvious that Lee is a devastated man still picking through the wreckage of a past life, the film takes its sweet time revealing the nature of the disaster that befell him. When we finally find out what it was, we recoil at the realization that it's even worse than we imagined, then understand why Lee not only resists the role his late brother assigned to him, but seems inclined to actively sabotage it.  On the surface this would all appear to be yet another twist on a familiar and often tedious Hollywood formula, the childish adult who's forced to grow up by being forced to take care of a minor. But Lonergan has too much respect for his characters, his audience, and perhaps reality itself to indulge such nonsense. Lee's backstory does confirm that he's essentially a masochist who has spent the last several years walling himself off from any chance at happiness out of guilt. But the same flashbacks that fill in the horrendous details of his past life also show that Lee has certain tendencies that have always been a part of his character and always will be. The movie acknowledges that if, in fact, Joe made him Patrick's guardian hoping to pull him out of his funk or somehow redeem him\u2014and the film itself never makes this clear, preferring to let Joe's motives stay mysterious\u2014then it was a bad call. Everyone, Lee included, seems to realize this. Advertisement Nevertheless, he tries the best he can, despite his limitations, out of loyalty to Joe. He navigates the unfamiliar, often infuriating experience of parenting a teenage boy, serving as grumbling chauffeur for Patrick's action-packed social calendar (he has a terrible rock band, plays on a hockey team, and bounces between two  girlfriends, played by Anna Baryshnikov, daughter of Mikhail, and \"Moonrise Kingdom\" costar Kara Hayward) and struggling to balance his work life with the home life he never imagined he'd have. This is hard enough for biological parents and children in non-grim circumstances. These two are partners in mourning, and even though they're too macho and sarcastic to discuss their bond openly, the wounds make themselves visible in other ways, most vividly in arguments about Patrick's complicated love life, the fate of Joe's beloved boat, and how best to dispose of Joe's remains (Patrick wants him buried, but it's a snowy winter and the ground is too hard, so they have to stash him in the freezer at the funeral parlor until spring).  Most of these details make the film sound unbearably dark, but while \"Manchester by the Sea\" does sometimes dive into pits of despair, most of the time it's a dry comedy. Lonergan has a fine eye for little indignities that turn tragedy into farce, as when emergency medical technicians repeatedly fail to collapse the legs of a gurney so that they can load it into the back of an ambulance. And his playwright's ear for deadpan exchanges is as keen as ever. Some of the most amusing bits in \"Manchester by the Sea\" take a moment to register because they aren't jokes, just records of people talking. \"What happened to your hand?\" Patrick asks Lee at the dinner table, noting a bloody bandage that Lee applied after smashing a window with his fist. \"I cut it,\" Lee mutters. \"Oh,\" Patrick says, barely looking up from his plate, \"for a minute there, I didn't know what happened.\" Lonergan has made two other classics, \"You Can Count on Me\" and \"Margaret\"; the latter was released to theaters in a butchered though still compelling version, so if you haven't seen it yet, watch the expanded cut, which is available on DVD and online. His first film was a compact, perfectly shaped, poignant and hilarious movie about a brother and sister (Mark Ruffalo and Laura Linney). \"Margaret,\" starring Anna Paquin as a young woman who accidentally causes a bus driver (Ruffalo) to kill a pedestrian, is a much grander, messier, more ambitious work, a film of statements as well as poetry, mingling gallows humor, suffering, introspection and hope. If you could somehow extract the experimental structure and darker moments of the second film and merge them with the compassion and wit of \"You Can Count on Me,\" you might end up with something like \"Manchester by the Sea,\" which carries itself like a traditional, even old fashioned drama set in the real world, but takes all sorts of liberties in arranging its characters and distributing its most crucial bits of plot information. Not every cut, transition or rhythmic gamble works, but it doesn't matter. The movie is so filled with life in all its splendor and awfulness that you're always more interested in finding out what's around the next bend than judging the effectiveness of whatever just happened.  Advertisement Most of the film's scenes are short. A few clock in at less than thirty seconds. Lonergan and his editor Jennifer Lame stitch them together with an intuitive grace. But mosaic is not the film's only mode. \"Manchester\" packs its first half with audaciously placed, surprisingly long flashbacks (some repeatedly interrupting a very brief physical action, such as a character exiting an office), and stocks its second half with boldly theatrical moments of confession and confrontation that are likewise allowed to play out as long as they need to. A conversation between two characters on a street corner in the story's final stretch becomes a duet of mortification and mercy that stacks up with the best of Mike Leigh (\"Secrets and Lies\"). It goes on for several minutes and consists of nothing more than alternating shots of the characters, but the feelings expressed within it are ratcheted up as expertly as the sense of dread you experience when watching a great horror movie. When the scene pivots and becomes something else entirely, the effect is cathartic. At times the snowbound or saltwater-blasted images of the town and  the soundtrack of soaring classical music, old soul, American songbook standards and jukebox rock seem to be joining forces to express  feelings that the characters can't or won't express themselves. One of the film's most devastating moments is captured entirely from the opposite side of a hockey rink; you can't hear anything the characters are saying to each other, but it's fine because their body language tells the story. The  contrast between the characters' poker faces and small gestures and Lonergan's sea-etched panoramas turns drama into comedy and vice-versa. It's the kind of movie you'll want to see a second time with someone who hasn't seen it yet, to remember what it was like to watch it for the first time.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Epic", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The most imaginative section of \"Epic\" starts with shots of the forest that rings the home of Professor Bomba (voiced by Jason Sudeikis), the inventor dad of the film's heroine, Mary Katherine (Amanda Seyfried). Some leaves and branches are in crisp focus. Others are out-of-focus. The images are so entrancing on their own terms that it takes a while to register the creatures in the out-of-focus parts of the shot, disguising themselves against foliage and bark. Then comes a very long, unbroken shot that prowls across a collage of significant objects: the professor's journals and equations, blueprints and sketches, research photos and files. These clerical objects look both \"real\" and illustrated; you can see dirt, dust, fingerprints. The imagery may remind film buffs of the opening credits of \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" which probed the contents of a box that Scout left for Boo Radley. Advertisement Before you get\u00a0 excited about \"Epic,\" \u00a0I should warn you that this sequence isn't representative of the film \u2014 not at all. What I've just described are the movie's end credits. They're afterthoughts, designed to keep older children amused while parents help little ones don their shoes and backpacks before tromping our for pizza.  But they offer hints of what \"Epic\" could have been, were it not such a slave to clich\u00e9s of modern American cartoon-making.  The latest from Blue Sky Studio (\"Ice Age,\" \"Rio\") is different from whatever Pixar, Disney or any other big animation outfit happens to be offering this year, but not so different that you should kick yourself for skipping it. There's a protagonist grieving over her mother's recent death, and a brilliant but scatterbrained father who loves his child but isn't the strong parental figure she desperately needs. There's a hidden world akin to Alice's Wonderland that the inquisitive heroine explores. There are beleaguered good guys that she joins in a war against bad guys that represent chaos and decay; their leader is a funny despot with a European accent. There's a mythology that will be fulfilled when good guys take a fragile pod on a journey toward a prophesied end. There's a young warrior with whom the heroine forms a flirtatious friendship. There's a tough older warrior who mentors the younger warrior. There are comic sidekicks, and a beautiful forest queen who utters platitudes about the cycles of life and then dies.  The good guys are the Leafmen, tiny forest sprites that look like humans. The bad guys are the Boggans, who look like storybook drawings of goblins or trolls. The sidekicks are two snails that worship the Leafmen and desperately want to be like them, but can't be, because they're snails. Josh Hutcherson of \"The Hunger Games\" provides the voice of the young warrior, Nod, who's physically gifted but immature; like Seyfried's Mary Katherine, he speaks with the circa-2013 colloquialisms and inflections of pretty much any teenager you'd run into at any mall anywhere in America. There's nothing special about him, or Mary Katherine, or Ronin, the older warrior voiced by Colin Farrell, or Mandrake, the funny-vicious bad guy voiced by Christoph Waltz, or Mug and Grub, the sidekick slugs voiced by Aziz Ansari and Chris O'Dowd. There's nothing special about Queen Tara, who's voiced by singer-actress Beyonce Knowles, or about Knowles' post-credits song, which will get an Oscar nomination anyway because the original song pickings are always slim.  The compositions are attractive but not striking, the action sequences engaging but rarely thrilling. Danny Elfman's score sounds like the kind of score you'd expect an animated forest adventure to have; I can't imagine anyone claiming that he phoned it in, just as I can't imagine anyone claiming that the director Chris Wedge (\"Ice Age,\" \"Robots\") phoned it his direction, or that the screenwriters phoned in their writing \u2014 though the fact that there are five credited writers suggests that what we see onscreen wasn't much like the first draft, or the second, or the ninth. Wedge appeared to confirm this in a 2012 interview with USA Today, in which he described the source, William Joyce's \"The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs,\" as \"a wonderful book\" but \"a quaint story... We wanted to make a gigantic action-adventure movie.\" Fair enough. Who doesn't love a gigantic action-adventure movie, especially one that's animated?  Advertisement The problem isn't that the vision changed in the transition from book to screen \u2014 that's true of most adaptations \u2014 but that it changed in ways that made the end product unremarkable. Look at the cover of the book, then look at any second from the film that it supposedly inspired; where the former is obviously the work of a singular consciousness, its cinematic spin-off has as much personality as a minivan. Films like \"Epic\" aren't so much created as manufactured, then released into multiplexes, where they're viewed by children and parents who treat them as two hours' worth of air conditioning with popcorn. The movie's marvelous trailer hinted at melancholy splendors, and an excess of beauty and feeling, but when you're actually sitting there watching the darned thing, it's \"Ferngully\" all over again. The ratio of humor and action and parent-child bonding is so formulaic, and the character design and molded-figurine-like animation so typical of the genre in the age of Pixar (and Pixar imitators), that \"Epic\" evaporates from the mind within minutes of leaving the theater.  The only reason this isn't a one-star review is that it would not be fair to blame \"Epic\" for failures of imagination that seem systemic. The movie is one more example of post-\"Toy Story\" bet-hedging by studios that want cartoon features to be different enough from other cartoon features to justify their existence, but not so different that they can't be used to sell Happy Meals and T-shirts and video games \u2014 and certainly not so original that audiences might have to come to terms with the shock of the new. While watching \"Epic\", it's hard to picture filmmakers as defiantly unique as Hayao Miyazaki (\"Spirited Away,\" \"Ponyo\") or Jean-Loup Felicioli and Alain Gagnol (\"A Cat in Paris\") or Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Parronaud (\"Persepolis\") thriving under American studio parameters. It's equally hard to guess how directors as original as Brad Bird (\"The Iron Giant,\" \"The Incredibles\") or Shane Acker (2009's \"Nine\") or Henry Selick (\"Coraline\") produced work of\u00a0 passion, integrity and surprise, and got them seen by mainstream audiences.  The most startling and delightful animation in American studio pictures tends to happen in a film's margins \u2014 in brief digressions from the main story (see the dream interludes in \"Kung Fu Panda 2\", which seemed to have been drawn in oil pastel) or in post-credits sequences that often feel as intimate as a tour of an artist's workspace. The end credits of \"Epic\" are so personal and lovely that I could have watched them for two hours. I wish I had.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "It's Not Yet Dark", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing romantic about death,\u201d Colin Farrell says during the opening montage of this movie. \u201cI love being alive.\u201d These are not Farrell\u2019s own words. The Irish actor is speaking for Simon Fitzmaurice, an Irish writer and filmmaker, whose first feature, \u201cMy Name Is Emily,\u201d was made in 2015. And the reason Farrell is speaking for him is not because, precisely, Fitzmaurice cannot. Strictly speaking, through his voice simulator, he can; but Fitzmaurice\u2014whose narration is adapted from a book that shares the title with this movie\u2014and director preferred Farrell\u2019s more robust tones. And the famous actor\u2019s participation has further value: it attaches a marquee name to this movie. And, probably much more importantly, it is the helpful gesture of a friend.  Advertisement Simon Fitzmaurice was diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease in 2008, and it has affected him to the extent that by the time this documentary was filmed, he was confined to a wheelchair, almost entirely paralyzed and reliant on an \u201ceye gaze\u201d computer to convey his thoughts. It was in this condition, incredibly, that he was able to direct \u201cMy Name Is Emily.\u201d This movie, directed by Frankie Fenton, tells Fitzmaurice\u2019s life story, one that is both heartbreaking and awe-inspiring.  As he sits in his wheelchair, his handsome, unlined-by-wrinkles face now framed by a dark, boxy beard, Fitzmaurice presents a visual enigma. It\u2019s wrenching when the movie shows still photographs and old video footage of his mobile self. Born in the 1970s into a family that loved movies, he got the writing bug early; his accounts of school, comradeship, early creative work, and love are both endearing and familiar. His elation at finding a soul mate, his wife Ruth (herself a writer) is infectious, as is his enthusiasm when his first short film is accepted to an NYU film festival, and his second gets to Sundance. There\u2019s a cute picture of Simon and Ruth standing outside the Ed Sullivan Theatre, seeing it, you think, there\u2019s a couple of out-of-towners you might have run into at a nearby bar and had a great time with over a few beers.  All seems to be going great, only while at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008, there with another short, he notices one of his feet feeling \u201cfloppy.\u201d Expecting a routine diagnosis from his doctor, he instead gets more or less a death sentence. He\u2019s told he only has three or four years to live. \u201cIs he talking about me?\u201d Fitzmaurice remembers thinking. This movie has some similarities, sadly, to \u201cGleason,\u201d a 2016 documentary about football player Steve Gleason and his trials and courage after getting ALS. \u201cIt\u2019s Not Yet Dark\u201d does not go into the same excruciating detail concerning the day-to-day challenges of being confined the way the Gleason picture does, but it is equally frank in showing that, as pragmatic and upbeat and positive as Simon and Ruth and their family and friends try to be as they go about life and work, the disease and its effects have emotionally gutted them all, and continues to do so. But there\u2019s never a \u201cI can\u2019t go on\u201d prefacing the \u201cI\u2019ll go on\u201d in Fitzmaurice\u2019s world. He is determined to realize \u201cEmily,\u201d and a crowd-funding campaign helps him do it. (Colin Farrell was among its most prominent boosters.) This movie shows how Fitzmaurice was able to direct the picture\u2014scheduling the shot so that he could efficiently marshal his energy was a big part of the process, as of course was the \u201ceye gaze\u201d computer. Fitzmaurice explains that he had to, of course, stop thinking about filmmaking in terms of \u201ccareer,\u201d potential or actual. This had a way of clarifying things. \u201cWhat remains is desire.\u201d I reviewed \u201cEmily\u201d for this website, and I wasn\u2019t crazy about it\u2014even though I acknowledged then that its existence is a miracle and should be celebrated as such. \u201cIt\u2019s Not Yet Dark\u201d did not change my opinion of the movie as such. But it made me hope hard that Simon Fitzmaurice gets to make another movie, and another after that, and so on.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Glassland", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Movies alone don't have the power to discourage people from drinking or encourage them to stop; but if they did, \"Glassland,\" about the relationship between an alcoholic mother and her grown son, might not be a bad candidate to show on Intervention Movie Night. Written and directed by Gerard Barrett, this intimate Irish drama travels a road that'll be familiar to anyone who's ever seen a film about addiction, or known an addict, but the fact that all stories of addiction are essentially the same doesn't blunt its impact.  Advertisement Jack Reynor plays a Dublin taxi driver named John who \r\nseems to spend much of his rather paltry downtime coping with his mom , Jean (Toni Collette), who by more than one person's estimate is drinking herself to death: suicide by debauchery. The film is a record of things experienced and seen, no more and no less. It starts with Jack waking up in the morning, and very quickly it gives us a glimpse of what it's like for him to share a flat with his mum. The place is a mess, there are dirty dishes piled high in the sink, and he waters down the milk he puts on his cereal, which is either a sign that they're low on money or that nobody in the house has the time or energy to go to the store.  The first time we meet Jean, she's passed out, seemingly overdosed; as soon as she recovers, thanks to her son scooping her up and taking her to the emergency room, she starts drinking again. John watches her while trying to get her to see herself. At one point he even takes out his cell phone and records one of her drunken, screaming rants, to give her an objective point-of-view on what it's like to be around her when she's at her worst. This has no effect on Jean. She doesn't need his pity or his attention. She can quit any time she wants. She's just having fun. It's no big deal. She's got it under control. And so on.  And yet there's nothing condemnatory in John's gaze, or the movie's. This overgrown boy still loves his mother, even though she makes his life hell and seems determined to kill herself one glass at a time. Sometimes he stares at her adoringly even when she's downing glass after glass of wine and dancing around the kitchen to \"Tainted Love\" (a rather on-the-nose music choice, but acceptable; sometimes life hands you a soundtrack). Sometimes he even drinks with her. Why not? That's all she ever really does: drink. If you want to relate to your mom you have to find common ground. Advertisement Is John an enabler? In some ways, yes. But he also genuinely wants his mom to stop drinking, and it's questionable whether a colder approach with Jean would yield a better result. Here's the thing about addicts who are in a relationship with a sober person, be it husband-wife, friend-friend, or parent-child: no matter what the sober person does, it's always the wrong thing, or not enough. He's too nice or too mean, too forgiving or too unforgiving, too indifferent or too involved, too this or too that. It's an impossible predicament. The sober person feels a deep sense of responsibility coupled with frustration over not being able to do anything that will unquestionably, tangibly help. It's ultimately up to the addict to decide to change. Jean's not there yet. Jack worries that she'll never get there, that she'll just keep drinking and drinking and then she'll be gone, and he'll blame himself, even though her life wasn't his to save, and he did the best he could. The two lead performances could not be better. Collette makes a powerful impression in a traditionally big, even explosive role; she gets to booze and dance, fall apart, scream, cry, yammer, make an ass of herself, dissolve in self-pity. But none of this quite feels like actor-y showboating because Collette invests Jean's behavior with a slightly detached quality, as if she's half-outside of her consciousness, observing herself as she acts out, and up. This is a common characteristic of drunks, who can feel simultaneously uninhibited and painfully self-conscious, socially awkward and theatrically exuberant. Reynor has the subtler role. It's largely reactive. Because John is an articulate but not always forthcoming person, there are many scenes where we feel absolutely certain that we know what he's feeling but don't really know what he's thinking, or what he'll do next.  This is a hard, spare, tough movie, at times nearly jarring in its lack of adornment. Barrett is mostly content to pick a camera angle and watch his characters behave. Once he's made his point, he cuts away, sometimes in the middle of a song, an argument, a rant, or a look. There's a quietly violent quality to the direction; we keep having moments taken away from us and forced to reorient ourselves and look at something else, something new, even when we're not ready. The net effect is not one of intoxication, as is the case in films like \"Leaving Las Vegas\" and \"Under the Volcano,\" but enforced sobriety. The film is told not through the eyes of a drinker, but somebody who cannot stop a loved one from drinking. Its rhythm and tone have a morning-after feel: the movie is banging on pots and pans and telling you to get out of bed and have some coffee. Now.           . Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Wanted 18", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "U.S. citizens almost never process the news that comes out\r\nof the Middle East as occurring in the context of people who are trying to have\r\neveryday lives. Physical battle and argument seems so constant that we rarely\r\nextend our imaginative empathy into quotidian realms. Such as, for instance,\r\nPalestinians wanting to nourish their\r\nkids with milk, or who want to take their coffee in a form besides black. \u201cThe Wanted 18\u201d is an unusual documentary, co-directed by\r\nAmer Shomali and Paul Cowan about a late-1980s attempt in a Palestinian town to\r\nachieve dairy self-sufficiency. During the first uprising deemed an \u201cintifada\u201d\r\nin that period, Palestinians organized various boycotts of Israelis services\r\nand commodities, and to that end, in the town of Beit Sahour, an enterprising\r\nfellow purchased 18 milk cows from a liberal kibbutz tender. The movie begins\r\nwith co-director Shomali, who calls Beit Sahour his home town despite the fact\r\nthat he was raised in a refugee camp, remembering reading about these cows in a\r\ncomic book when he was a boy. This inspires the movie\u2019s most potentially\r\neyebrow-raising formal strategy: telling portions of the story via\r\ncomic-book-style graphics and stop-motion animation. Shomali raises the ante by\r\nanthropomorphizing four of the cows, giving them names\u2014Rikva, Ruth, Goldie, and\r\nLola\u2014and the power of speech.

One anecdote ends with an armed member of the Israeli security\r\nforce stepping out of his jeep and into a large pile of freshly laid manure,\r\nand the ensuing indignation. Jalal Oumsieh, one of the Beit Sahour residents\r\nwho got the ball rolling, has a hard time containing his amusement as he\r\nrecollects Israeli officials going door-to-door and waving portraits of bovines\r\nin people\u2019s faces while asking \u201cHave you seen this cow?\u201d", "Critic": "Gamma"}

The colors are beautiful, the design of the varied realms is ingenious and pleasing, the animation fluid and graceful.

His quest will end, he proclaims, when he bests the last earthly master of chi, who happens to be our hero Po.  When we see him on Earth, Po is having trouble enough taking over the martial arts school from supposedly retiring master Shifu. After some martial-arts-equipment-destroying rounds with old pals Tigress, Mantis, Viper, and Monkey, Po has been pummeled back into the identity crisis that\u2019s occasionally haunted the so-called Dragon Warrior throughout the series. The plot thickens when Po\u2019s biological father (series adepts know that Po has been adopted by a crane) Li shows up to bring him back up to Secret Panda Village. Turns out Li\u2019s on a mission that was shown to him in the form of a letter from the universe.\u00a0 None of this makes a whole lot of sense even in a world in which cranes adopt pandas and raise them as their own, and a lot of the plot points and catchphrases made me suspect the screenwriters just picked a lot of Sun Ra and Return to Forever song titles at random and dumped them into a Final Draft edit function. It kind of doesn\u2019t matter though, because the movie moves inexorably to a climax wherein Po conquers his fears and misgivings, embraces the awesome, and with the help of friends and family\u2014all being voiced with maximum likable sincerity by the best cast in the business (luminaries such as Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan, and David Cross all return, while newbies include J.K.

{"Title": "A Good Marriage", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "What is it about Stephen King\u2019s novels and short stories\r\nthat so often make their transition to the screen rocky, to say the least? Even\r\nwhen he adapts, as he does with \u201cA Good Marriage,\u201d starring Joan Allen and\r\nAnthony LaPaglia, the resulting product regularly fails to capture the breadth\r\nof his gifts as a storyteller. Perhaps it\u2019s because so many of King\u2019s best\r\nnarratives involve something easier to relate to in the form of the written\r\nword than recreated on film: the horror behind the picket fence. Little is\r\nscarier than the realization that your husband (\u201cThe Shining\u201d), rescuer (\u201cMisery\u201d),\r\ncar (\u201cChristine\u201d) or even family pet (\u201cCujo\u201d) are not what they seem. And yet\r\nthat same identifiable horror in his fiction often falls flat in film. Flat is\r\nthe kindest way to describe \u201cA Good Marriage,\u201d a King novella turned feature\r\nthat could have worked as a short or an episode of \u201cMasters of Horror\u201d but\r\ntruly tests viewer patience at 102 minutes. It\u2019s arguably the dullest King film\r\nyet, despite solid work by LaPaglia to save it and a decent set-up that goes\r\nabsolutely nowhere. Advertisement I remember seeing George Sluizer\u2019s \u201cThe Vanishing\u201d at a\r\nyoung enough age to be disturbed not just by its legendary ending but by the\r\nvery concept that a madman could also be a family man. Wait, not all serial\r\nkillers are drooling maniacs? I might be living next door to one? And he might\r\nhave a wife? And kids?!?!?! How is that possible? King reportedly was inspired\r\nby the fact that The BTK Killer had a wife, who dealt with a lot of negative\r\npress when his binding/torturing/killing came to light. How could she not have\r\nknown? He reimagines BTK as \u201cBeadie,\u201d a man who has killed a dozen\r\nyoung women in Maine. After Bob (LaPaglia) goes out of town on another\r\ncollectible coin-hunting mission tied in with work, longtime wife Darcy (Allen)\r\nhappens upon a BDSM magazine in the garage. She digs a little deeper, and she\r\nfinds a box with driver\u2019s licenses of the dead girls. She starts putting it\r\ntogether. Bob is Beadie. What will she do? Will she confront him? How will she\r\nprotect her three kids from the pain sure to come? \u201cA Good Marriage,\u201d at its best, should be a war of wills\r\nbetween a maniac and the wife who just learned she has loved a maniac. And yet this\r\nwar is surprisingly, even shockingly dull. It's filmed like a TV movie, with the central setting of Bob & Darcy's house feeling bizarrely like a set. Nothing in this world is lived in. There are no stakes. There's no reason to care.  Part of the problem is both in the\r\nway Darcy is crafted in the screenplay and the choices made by Allen in\r\npresenting her. This Darcy is cold, and almost callous at times. I simply never\r\nbelieved her dilemma. And if that\u2019s true, all of \u201cA Good Marriage\u201d falls apart.\r\nLaPaglia does better work, almost finding a dark current of Coen-esque black\r\ncomedy in the coin-collecting lunatic.

{"Title": "The Other Side of Hope", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The Finnish director Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki films are often marked by a particular kind of humor. As I\u2019ve been saying since the early 1990s, he really can put the \u201cdead\u201d in \u201cdeadpan.\u201d This was particularly true in such \u201890s pictures as \u201cThe Match Factory Girl\u201d and \u201cI Hired A Contract Killer,\u201d tales of privation and depression that treated these subjects with both gravity and acknowledgement of an overall absurdity in the human condition. Mr. Kaurism\u00e4ki\u2019s protagonists are often drink-soaked sad sacks who achieve a kind of sodden resignation. In cases where they\u2019re not these types, they\u2019re the Leningrad Cowboys, an unlikely \u201crock\u201d \u201cband\u201d that carries on inexorably despite their ineptitude and the bemused semi-indifference of nearly every audience they encounter. Advertisement In recent years, though, the director has found something to believe in, and this has added a humanist dimension to his pictures that is both pleasing and moving. His 2011 \u201cLe Havre\u201d was about a shoe-shiner in the title French port who takes in a young African teen who came on a container ship. Aside from being an excellent illustration of the Christian proverb about loving thy neighbor, it was also a warm and funny film standing up for the larger principle of immigration. So too is his latest feature, \u201cThe Other Side of Hope.\u201d Because it\u2019s set in his native Finland, I suppose this picture has more of what I\u2019ll call Akian tropes than \u201cLe Havre\u201d did. One of its protagonists, Wikstr\u00f6m, drives around in a sleek, oversized black car of a vintage unknown to me, in keeping with the director\u2019s insistence of never depicting a post-1962 auto. Wikstr\u00f6m is a man at loose ends, having dissolved his marriage and subsequently won a small fortune at poker. He decides to invest that cash in a small bar/restaurant that\u2019s very down at its heels, and whose staff is highly ambivalent about the quality of attention that comes with a new owner. In the meantime, Khaled, a Syrian refugee who\u2019s come in via a coal ship (his emergence on docking is an unforgettable image) is being processed through Finland\u2019s supposedly humane immigration system. But once he\u2019s very politely rejected, he goes on the lam. Not selfishly\u2014he is merely desperate to get word from his sister in Syria while he is in Europe, and to arrange her passage out of Syria from the safety of Helsinki. Once Khaled and Wikstr\u00f6m\u2019s paths cross for the second time (their first encounter is when Wikstr\u00f6m almost runs him down in that aforementioned car), hope is revived, and comedy blossoms, as when Wikstr\u00f6m tries to transform his place into a sushi restaurant. But Khaled\u2019s quest is made difficult by belligerent racist skinheads. By the time Khaled is actually put in touch with his sister, the race against time is even more critical. The movie expands upon Kaurism\u00e4ki\u2019s central mode of observation and delivers some trenchant, upsetting truths about the immigration experience from the side of those seeking asylum. While in the detaining center awaiting a ruling on his case, Khaled is told by a friend not to appear too cheerful, as people will take him for mentally disturbed. Of course a serious mien may lead some to react with fear. As for the skinheads, they consistently get Khaled\u2019s ethnicity wrong as they spew hate at him. Kaurism\u00e4ki makes these bigots look ridiculous, but he also takes very seriously the damage they do, and the movie\u2019s finale takes that into account. Its suggestive title lingers at the end, leaving a question mark that the viewer will have to turn over personally, and that\u2019s a good thing.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Metallica Through the Never", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Metallica doesn't do anything small. Their songs are relentless assaults of sound, sometimes topping the 8 or 9-minute mark. It's not a surprise then that \"Metallica: Through the Never,\" their 3-D IMAX concert film/apocalyptic Mad Max story, directed by Nimr\u00f3d Antal, is a gigantic spectacle, a virtual-reality experience that is both ridiculous and sublime, sometimes in the same moment.  The band members, lead singer/guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, drummer Lars Ulrich, and bassist Robert Trujillo, came up with the concept, giving it a personal stamp which longtime Metallica fans will recognize. The Metallica concert in the film features laser beams, a Tesla coil shooting actual lightning bolts through the air, a gigantic statue of Lady Justice which crumbles to bits around the band members, white crosses emerging from beneath the stage floor, dry ice\u2026the only thing missing from that arena stage is an 18-inch tall Stone Henge. Meanwhile, there's a fictional storyline that runs alongside the concert: a young roadie named Trip (Dane DeHaan) is sent on an important mission to retrieve a bag needed by the band. \"Metallica: Through the Never\" moves back and forth, from concert to Trip and back. Advertisement The concert was filmed at Rexall Place, an arena in Edmonton, Alberta. The stage is huge and cross-shaped, with Lars Ulrich's drum set placed in the transept. The three other guys wander around freely, sometimes meeting up, but mostly facing out, communicating with the masses of gyrating fans. Twenty-four cameras were used, and cinematographer Gyula Pados brings us in close enough that we can almost feel the sweat flying off of Trujillo's long hair as he spins his head, and also pulls us back, way back, to give a sense of the sheer scope of the production and the audience. The fans are packed in tight, pushing against the barriers near the stage, pulsing their arms in the air. The effect of all of this is so visceral and immediate that it really is the next best thing to being there. Cutting away from the concert to follow Trip's attempt to retrieve the missing bag is a risky device and doesn't work initially, because the concert is so engrossing you resent being made to leave it. But it grew on me as the film progressed, and ended up having a startlingly emotional resonance by the closing shots of the film. Here's what happens. Trip takes off in a battered van to go get this missing bag. Civilization appears to have broken down. Cars are on fire. Riot police and mobs face off. People are strung up from lampposts and dangle in the wind. (There's a reason \"Metallica: Through the Never\" is rated R.) Trip finds himself singled out by the mob. A literal horseman of the Apocalypse, wielding a gigantic mallet and wearing a gas mask, gallops after him. Trip is beaten up, set on fire, dragged behind a horse, chased through dark alleys. What is in the bag that Metallica needs? Well, if you've seen your Hitchcock, then you know that doesn't matter. All of these scenes are tied thematically to Metallica's concert song list, which span the 30 years of Metallica's career, from early songs like \"Creeping Death,\" to later songs like \"Cyanide.\" All the major hits are covered: \"Master of Puppets,\" \"One,\" \"The Memory Remains,\" \"Enter Sandman,\" \"And Justice For All,\" \"Battery,\" \"Nothing Else Matters.\" Metallica's music is not light. They are not carefree guys. Even their ballads are gloomy. Trip's struggle to survive in a violent dystopian world is reflective not only of Metallica's most common themes, but also echoes what the music actually sounds like. Metallica's music is fast, aggressive, and demanding. As macho as Metallica's collective stage presence is, what they tap into is a very dark place where they are alone, helpless, and isolated. Music critic Steve Huey once observed that \"in one way or another, nearly every song on 'Master of Puppets' deals with the fear of powerlessness.\" That's where the rage comes from. Advertisement Trip, as played by Dane DeHaan, is a skinny kid in black jeans and a hoodie. He is overwhelmed by forces larger than him. He is not physically strong. He is an outcast. James Hetfield may be a tattooed rock god, wearing all black and a bullet belt, stalking around on a stage the size of St. John the Divine like he owns the joint, but he still identifies with guys like Trip. He identifies with the outcasts, the scared kids of the world (\"Enter Sandman.\" their most famous song, features a child's voice praying), and Trip is the stand-in for all kids who feel like they don't fit in, who are scared and feel powerless, who find strength in music like Metallica's. That's when the device stopped feeling like a device and felt like an expression of the band's identification with its own fan base, with the guys they used to be. It was 1983 when Metallica's first album came out, a year where The Police and Michael Jackson dominated the pop charts. Heavy metal fans were part of a vibrant underground scene, where bootleg cassette tapes were passed around. Metallica are Rock and Roll Hall of Famers now. Their actions (and albums) have not always pleased their hard-core fan base. Remember when they sued Napster? Remember \"Load,\" their sixth album, seen by many fans as a betrayal of what the band was all about? Some of the oldest fans think Metallica sold out with what is known as \"the black album.\" These things are still being argued about on heavy metal websites and fan forums. And then of course, they all went into therapy in order to heal the rifts in their relationships, a process documented in the fascinating 2004 documentary \"Some Kind of Monster.\" The album that resulted from that therapy process, \"St. Anger,\" received mixed reviews but still sold millions of copies. You can see that up-and-down journey in the concert itself, as technical snafus threaten to derail the whole thing, forcing the band to go back to basics. Some of the best moments in the film involve footage of the concert audience. There is one audience member I keep remembering, and he appears for only a second. He was pushed up against the barrier. He had his shirt off, like a lot of the guys did, and his arms were in the air, eyes closed, lost to everything else but that immediate moment. There are millions more of him around the world. And there were thousands more in that arena. The sound of the audience singing along is so powerful it sounds like a political rally about to turn violent. Even James Hetfield at one point seems a bit taken aback at the collective sound of thousands of people singing his lyrics. At the end of the film, during the credits, the words \"To the Metallica Family of Fans\" scroll by on the screen. \"Metallica: Through the Never\" is a vehicle that could reach a new generation of fans, who wouldn't even know what the term \"bootleg cassette tape\" meant, but know great music when they hear it. With all of the dazzling special effects \"Metallica Through the Never\" offers, and with all of the violent encounters poor fictional Trip experiences, it's that shirtless fan, arms raised, that encapsulates what the film is all about, encapsulates what Metallica is all about. To paraphrase one of Metallica's most famous lyrics, that's the memory that remains.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Annabelle", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "A word of advice for horror movie producers: If you\u2019re going\r\nto riff on \u201870s horror classics like \u201cThe Omen\u201d and \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby,\u201d make\r\nsure to look more deeply at why those films connected with viewers rather than just stealing their imagery. Merely mimicking\r\nthem aesthetically is a hollow exercise, and proof that you don\u2019t understand\r\nthat horror is more than a series of jump cuts and frightening images. Horror,\r\nat its best, taps into something deeper.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing deep about \u201cAnnabelle,\u201d\r\nthe spin-off of \u201cThe Conjuring.\u201d It offers\u00a0surface level scares without the undercurrent\r\nof humanity needed to make them register. Director John R. Leonetti and writer Gary Dauberman\u00a0work proficiently enough on a technical level to craft a few scenes that get the\r\nheart racing, but the climax of \u201cAnnabelle\u201d is so misguided, silly and even offensive that any excuse genre fans may be\r\ninclined to make for the mediocre hour-and-a half that precedes it will likely turn to rage. \u00a0 Advertisement For the record\u2014and it\u2019s worth noting because of how angry\r\nour original review of \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d still makes fans of that film\u2014I was a fan of James Wan\u2019s 2013 ghost story. The director took a giant leap forward in that\r\nwork, proving he understands numerous elements that modern horror directors\r\nignore, such as the use of sound\r\ndesign and setting to create tension. These elements are discarded in \u201cAnnabelle.\" If you saw the 2013 hit, you remember the creepy doll that wouldn\u2019t go away. Ghostbusters Lorraine and Ed Warren kept Annabelle in a\r\nlocked case, recognizing the true evil held within. How did Annabelle go from a\r\nrelatively harmless but totally creepy doll to a tool of the devil? \u201cAnnabelle\u201d\r\ntries to tell that story, using the Manson Murders and \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d as a\r\nbackdrop. Some may be tempted to write off \u201cAnnabelle\u201d on concept alone, in\r\nthat it\u2019s something of a cash grab, like a straight-to-video sequel\r\ndesigned to strike while a hit predecessor's iron is still hot. Still, I would argue\r\nthat \u201cAnnabelle\u201d has the core of a good film within it. It's about how changing times in the \u201870s, when otherwise safe neighborhood dwellers\r\nstarted locking their doors and apartment denizens began to suspect their\r\nneighbors; the iconography of youth became sinister.\r\nYou can sense shreds of this idea in \u201cAnnabelle,\u201d but the film doesn't develop them. We learn that Annabelle was owned by a lovely young couple\r\nnamed Mia (Annabelle Wallis) and John (Ward Horton). In the run-up to the birth of their first child,\u00a0John gave his wife the\r\ndoll as a part of her extensive collection. As Mia nears her due date, the couple faces unimaginable\r\nhorror in the form of a pair of Satanic cultists who break in, stab Mia in the\r\nbelly, and end up dead in their home. The female cultist happens to be named\r\nAnnabelle Higgins, and some of her blood lands on the doll Annabelle. Before\r\nyou know it, Mia is seeing shadowy figures on the stairs, hearing noises in the\r\nnight and realizing that something evil wants her baby.  Thematically, nothing in \u201cAnnabelle\u201d is developed beyond a level that might make it suitable for horror movie manipulations. When we meet religious characters like Father Perez (Tony Amendola), \u201cAnnabelle\u201d threatens to take on some \"The Exorcist\" or \"The Omen\"-like undertones, chronicling a time when some felt that Americans lost touch with their religious institutions. But the movie doesn\u2019t really go\r\nthere. When no one believes Mia\u2019s haunting stories, \u201cAnnabelle\u201d threatens to\r\nbecome a piece about how new mothers can be ignored, their concerns portrayed as the byproduct of hormones. But this notion isn't developed, either. \u00a0 Advertisement There are other problems. Wallis and Horton are remarkably\r\nunengaging leads. She mumbles, he over-emotes, and the doll is allowed to steal\r\nscenes. And the film is visually flat. Pan reveals (panning across a door or\r\nroom to reveal something in the background) are over-used, and the sound is\r\nmixed to grating levels. It\u2019s a movie that screams \"Boo!\" instead of trying to get under your skin. There is one great set piece involving a storage unit in the\r\nbasement and an elevator that just won\u2019t leave it, but that\u2019s something you can\r\nwatch on cable later, while ignoring the weak film that surrounds it.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Authors Anonymous", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Movie lovers were understandably sad that the great character actor Dennis Farina died last year. Movie lovers SHOULD be royally ticked off that the great character actor Dennis Farina was apparently spending the twilight of his career appearing in dreck like \"Authors Anonymous,\" which according to varied sources on the Internet, was his second-to-last movie. As the title for this remarkably limp and obvious ensemble comedy suggests, \"Author\u2019s Anonymous\" is about a writers\u2019 group. That is to say, a group of wannabe scribes who meet together and workshop/critique each other\u2019s works, each member nurturing, if not outright milking dry, the hope of finding representation, publication, and best sellerdom. Advertisement First-time-credited screenwriter David Congalton, ignoring the rule about how if one wants to make fun of the aspirations of other writers, one ought to check oneself and one\u2019s talent pretty mercilessly before even setting down word one, peoples this group (set in the literary hotbed of Los Angeles) with exceptionally predictable types. Farina plays a tough-guy Tom Clancy wannabe. Chris Klein\u2019s a Fitzgerald devotee who\u2019s also a pizza delivery boy. Teri Polo\u2019s a flighty Danielle Steel wannabe, I think; Dylan Walsh is her optometrist husband who\u2019s Polo\u2019s top enabler. Jonathan Bennet\u2019s a Bukowski wannabe\u2014sample dialogue, or rather monologue, because, cleverly enough, \"Authors Anonymous\" indifferently adopts the conceit of being a \u201cdocumentary\u201d about its characters: \u201cI am here because of Bukowski. Charles Bukowski. Greatest writer ever. Period. L.A. is his town, man. If I\u2019m gonna be a writer, you know, I\u2019ve gotta walk in Bukowski\u2019s shoes, man.\u201d (So, see, setting the movie in Los Angeles really DOES make sense.) And Kaley Cuoco of \"The Big Bang Theory\" fame and Internet shut-in lust plays an airhead who\u2019s never heard of Jane Austen. So guess which member of the group gets an agent and a book deal and a six-figure movie deal? If you guessed, you really don\u2019t need to see this movie. If you didn\u2019t, you really don\u2019t need to see this movie. Seriously. The scene depicting a book signing at a hardware store seemed, to me, this movie\u2019s peak bottom, if you will, but by that point the picture still had 45 minutes to go. Farina\u2019s talent is thrown away here; Cuoco is funnier on her sitcom; Klein and Polo you just kind of feel bad for. Hence, the only reason to watch this picture is for the novelty value of feeling bad for Chris Klein and/or Teri Polo. To each his own, but my recommendation is \"pass.\"", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Art of the Steal", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "There are a handful of actors working today whose mere presence justifies whatever film they are in. Kurt Russell is at the top of a very short list for me, and has been so for decades. What a great career. What a niche he has carved out for himself. He brings something uniquely his own to everything he does. He is a sexy leading man, a comedic buffoon, a wonderful physical actor, and a hell of a mimic (see his performances as Elvis Presley and Herb Brooks). His last major role was the so-enjoyable-it-should-be-illegal Stuntman Mike in Quentin Tarantino's 2007 \"Death Proof,\" and that means it's been far too long since he's graced us with his presence. He is back, as the scarred and black-leather-clad \"Crunch Calhoun\", in Jonathan Sobol's fun and stylish art-heist flick \"The Art of the Steal\". Packed with great actors, some uproarious sequences, and a fast-moving, far-fletched plot, \"The Art of the Steal\" looks and feels like a crime thriller, but it's a comedy, and each actor has clicked into his respective role with a gusto and enjoyment that really makes the film.  Advertisement Part art thief and part Evel Knievel, Crunch Calhoun is the leader of a merry band of international art forgers who have nicknames like \"The Rolodex,\" \"The Scratcher,\" \"The Idea Man\". Sobol freezes each member of the team, rolling out their names and nicknames in big blocky text, creating a snarky larger-than-life environment in which these eccentrics can operate. There is Chris Diamantopoulos as Guy, the brilliant French forger whose work can even ape proper carbon-dating, and who dreams of a notoriety as grand as \"celebrated\" forger Yves Chaudron. There is Kenneth Welsh as Uncle Paddy, the randy Irishman who can find buyers for all the fakes produced by Guy, and finally, there is the hot-headed and sloppy Nicky, half-brother to Crunch, played by Matt Dillon, who comes up with the idea for the grand \"final score\" on which they all could retire.  When the film opens, Crunch has been released from a 5-and-a-1/2 year stint in a Warsaw prison, having been handed up by Nicky as the fall guy for an art heist gone wrong. He makes a paltry living by leaping his motorcycle through rings of fire at car derbies all while wearing a white jumpsuit studded with blue stars. He now has an apprentice named Francie (the terrific Jay Baruchel), a nice wife named Lola (Katheryn Winnick), and a hatred of the brother who betrayed him. He refuses to get involved in any new scheme. He's out, he's done. And yet in his spare time, he sits in his La-Z-Boy reading a book on great art thefts, and lecturing Francie on how various Roman Emperors handled the problems of life. Crunch Calhoun clearly won't be able to stay straight for long.  The thieves are always being stopped at various borders (the film leaps around from Detroit to Quebec to Amsterdam, Paris and London), and a driven Interpol agent (Jason Jones) has partnered with an art-thief-turned informant (Terence Stamp) to try to nail down whatever it is the thieves are plotting. Terence Stamp plays his role in a mild-mannered abstracted way which highlights the frustrated machismo of the Interpol agent, who crushes cups of hot coffee in his bare hands, and then says, after the fact, \"Ow.\" Stamp has a dreamy-eyed monologue about his experience going to the Victoria and Albert museum as a child, and seeing a cup made entirely of jade: \"It made me look at everything differently.\" The whole film stops, surprisingly, beautifully, for his long monologue about what art means to him. A lesser director would have cut that monologue as an irrelevant time-waster. But Sobol (who also wrote the script) not only gives that monologue a great payoff near the end of the film, but he also knows that the plot is not really \"the thing\" here, anyway. What is \"the thing\" is the performances, the actors, the shtick, the mood.  Advertisement \"The Art of the Steal\" is filled with funny bits of farcical physical business, wisecracks, and an intensifying feeling of entrapment, causing the characters to race around like maniacs. The best of these is when a panicked Francie, who can barely believe the level of crime he has entered into (\"Interpol's a real thing??\"), is roped into transporting two of the criminals across the Canadian border in the trunk of his car. He glues a long beard to his chin, and proceeds to behave in a totally suspicious manner while being questioned by the border patrol agent, finally babbling, \"I'm in a play. Witness, the musical. With an exclamation mark.\" Silliness like that keeps \"The Art of the Steal\" afloat. I wish more films felt permission to be as silly as this one is. Everyone is great. Everyone looks like they are having a blast. The right mood is set early on, insouciant, self-aware, and absurd.  As the film moves into its third act, where, traditionally, plot with a capital P takes over, \"The Art of the Steal\" knows that what interests us is these characters, these actors, their behavior, their interactions. The plot is certainly given its due, and the heist that unfolds is gorgeously complex and insane. But it's wonderful to see a genre film keeping its strong interest in character, rather than plot, right up until the satisfying final frame. Kurt Russell could read the phone book and I'd pay to see it. It's great to have him back. \"The Art of the Steal\" is only 90 minutes long, and never takes itself too seriously, or seriously at all. The film feels light, but that is not a criticism, at least not in the case of \"Art of the Steal\". It's why the film works.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Concussion", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The story is old and familiar: Married couple, busy with work and raising children, lose the passion and start taking each other for granted. One person strays, seeking sexual thrills. Events then unfold in a predictable fashion. The couple either re-connects or disintegrates. We've read it in great literature, we've seen it in more movies than be counted.  \"Concussion\", a new film written and directed by Stacie Passon, takes this well-worn storyline and makes something unique out of it, something fresh and bizarre. It's not just because \"Concussion\" is about a marriage between two women, although that is part of it. The lesbian marriage pictured here has all the trappings of good happy suburban life, but with the same underlying malaise we have come to expect in such portrayals. Abby and Kate's lesbianism is treated as a given, barely worth dwelling on. It was a treat watching the film because I actually didn't know what would happen next. How is that possible with such familiar material? The script is excellent, with some pretty sharp edges, but I credit mostly Robin Weigert, whose portrayal of Abby is one of the best performances of the year.  Advertisement Abby and Kate (Julie Lawrence) are married, and living in the suburbs, raising two kids. After Abby gets a concussion in the first scene, bonked on the head by her kid's baseball, things change. Rifts that were probably there before crack open into gigantic crevasses. The spark is gone from the marriage. Abby is sexually hungry, Kate seems to prefer celibacy. Kate has a demanding job as a divorce lawyer, and Abby has a business flipping apartments in nearby Manhattan.  One day, almost on a whim, Abby makes an appointment with a prostitute. The experience is not pleasing, but it sparks something in her. With the help of her contractor Justin (Johnathan Tchaikovsky), whose girlfriend just happens to run a call-girl business out of her pre-law dorm room, Abby sets herself up as a belle du jour, using one of her properties in Manhattan as a workplace, and calling herself \"Eleanor\".  \"Eleanor\" meets with her clients for coffee beforehand, and then sets up an appointment at the loft. The majority of her clients, at first, are college students, either curious or lonely or both. Because the apartment in New York is a work in progress, and she and Justin are still fixing it up, she has a plausible explanation for why she is gone during the day so much. As long as she is home in time to pick up the kids from school, Kate barely seems to notice what is going on.  In her spare time, Abby hangs out with the other soccer moms in her upscale neighborhood, going to spinning class every morning, gossiping over coffee. What bonds them is the fact that they are all moms with kids the same age. Abby has a casual crush on Sam (played by the wonderful Maggie Siff, who played Rachel Menken in Season 1 of \"Mad Men\"), who is not part of the group, is married to a partner at Goldman Sachs, and is beautiful and distant.  While it is not a surprise to us that eventually Sam makes an appointment with \"Eleanor\", it is a huge surprise to Abby. Her compartmentalized worlds begin to collide. \"Concussion\" is most interesting when it is about the lies we tell ourselves in order to get along in day to day life, the pretense required for us to maneuver socially. If someone asks, \"How are you?\" it is expected that you reply, \"Fine, how are you?\", not \"Ever since I got hit on the head, I feel totally disconnected.\" Abby stops being able to pretend.  Advertisement On the flipside, what we see in the \"Eleanor\" scenes is Abby lost in the world of pretending. This is part of the job of prostitution, of course, in becoming someone else's fantasy. Sometimes she dresses elegantly, other times she's sleek and lean in black leather. With a sweet overweight college girl who has never been kissed, Abby is emotionally supportive. Some women like it rough. Some women like it slow. Abby can do it all. She gets very good \"reviews\". The scenes with her clients are sexy, but not graphically so. The scenes are more about the energy of sex, the moment when you let go and give over to sensation. Abby is comfortable being dominant, setting the mood and pace. When she tries the same things at home with Kate, it does not go over well.  One of her regular clients, known only as Woman #3, is played by the great Laila Robins. In their first meeting, Abby is obviously taken aback by the fact that Woman #3 is older than she is. Abby has been comfortable being \"the older woman\" with her other clients. It gives her an edge up, an advantage. That advantage is lost with Woman #3, who is sexually experienced, knows what she wants, and isn't intimidated by Abby. She clocks Abby immediately as a manipulator and tries to walk out. Abby, befuddled for the first time, has to coax her to stay.  What we get in these scenes with Laila Robins, without the script ever being explicit about it, is that women fear growing older, and women fear other women who are older than themselves. It's like looking into a dark mirror. What is granted power in our culture is Youth, and Abby, at 42, is no longer young. Woman #3 is no longer young either, but she, unlike Abby, holds power in her own hands. Abby doesn't like that. She wants to be the Alpha. It's a very complex dynamic, and we get it all from the eloquent behavior of Robins and Weigert.  Advertisement Robin Weigert is known mainly to HBO audiences as Calamity Jane from \"Deadwood\", although she's been a regular on many other television shows since then. She gives a star performance here. Her work is reminiscent of Jill Clayburgh, or Diane Keaton, or Ellen Burstyn, leading ladies in an era of film that did not shy away from mess and ambiguity. Weigert's emotions are unpredictable. She sits with the other bored soccer moms, and she seems to be looking at them with a cold assessing eye. There's something unpleasant about her as the film goes on. She has a secret. She knows something the other women don't. It makes her feel superior. She's childish. When she says to Sam, scoffing, \"You're just bored,\" Sam retorts, \"You're bored, too!\" Somehow, this had never occurred to Abby.  Stacie Passon, who comes from a commercial background, distinguishes herself with the script and her direction. Unfortunately, the final third of the film loses the momentum that had been building throughout, and \"Concussion\" limps towards the finish line. But overall, Passon has a great eye and ear for the rhythms of everyday life, the snatches of conversation at dinner parties, the way we behave when we are trying to hide something. The sudden moments of truth and revelation are starkly highlighted against the disorienting patterns of Abby's double-life. In one late-night conversation with her wife, Abby says, casually, that she doesn't like \"the Christopher Columbus line\" their daughter has to say in a school project. \"It bothers me,\" Abby says. \"Doesn't it bother you?\" Kate, frustrated in a way that suddenly becomes palpable, says, \"I just want you to like SOMEthing.\" Her words are another blunt blow to the head, and Weigert's face shows the shock of it. What is so interesting about Weigert's portrayal of Abby, what makes it so compulsively watchable, is that you understand that she doesn't quite know why she is doing what she is doing. She has stopped asking herself questions. Maybe she never asked those questions in the first place.  It's fascinating to watch a lead character who is a mystery even to herself. It elevates what could have been banal material into something existential, something mysterious and true.", "Critic": "Alpha"}

Advertisement In a not-too-distant future, the elite have access to a\r\nvirtual reality playground that allows them to live out their wildest fantasies\r\nwith \u201cBlade Runner\u201d-esque androids who look and behave exactly like real\r\npeople. Always wanted to rob a bank and shoot your way out of the ensuing\r\nconflict? Go to Vice, run by the above-the-law Julian (Bruce Willis). Of\r\ncourse, as in all Hollywood condemnations of violent video game culture (which\r\nis what this is at its core), the violence of this fantasy world bleeds out\r\ninto the real world, making problems for tough-as-nails cop Roy (Jane). The\r\npaper-thin idea being that if people are allowed to give into their wildest\r\nfantasies, they won\u2019t be able to distinguish between them and reality. And so\r\nthe people who get ultra-violent in the world of Vice continue that in Roy\u2019s\r\ndistrict, leading him to target Julian as public enemy #1. Meanwhile, Kelly (Ambyr Childers, so great in the underrated\r\n\u201cWe Are What We Are\u201d), a replicant in the world of Vice who goes through every\r\nday thinking that\u2019s a special one and usually ends up killed, has become\r\nself-aware. Without warning, her system malfunctions, and she\u2019s overloaded with\r\nmemories she shouldn\u2019t have. Self-aware, she goes on the run, even tracking\r\ndown her creator and helping Roy topple the corrupt adult playground of Vice. If it sounds familiar, it should. Borrowing liberally from\r\nclassics like \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and dozens of quasi-sci-fi non-classics like \u201cVirtuosity,\u201d \u201cVice\u201d feels\r\nas artificially replicated as the androids in its narrative. Judged\r\nsuperficially, \u201cVice\u201d does nothing that hasn\u2019t been done before with more style\r\nand substance. The movie is visually dull even when judged against its\r\nlow-budget, essentially straight-to-VOD brethren. Most people don\u2019t come to\r\nmovies like \u201cVice\u201d for complex visual storytelling, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\r\nshould excuse cheap sets, dull framing and other signs of lazy filmmaking. Even if it didn\u2019t work as art or escapism, \u201cVice\u201d wastes an\r\nopportunity for social commentary as well. Roy is a non-character, almost so\r\ninconsequential to the storyline that poor Jane doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s been\r\ndirected to do anything in the climactic scenes. Even the director\r\nrealized they didn\u2019t need him. Worst of all, \u201cVice\u201d is about giving personality\r\nand life to an android female who has been created as a plaything for men to\r\nabuse and behave with without repercussions. And yet turning Kelly self-aware\r\ndoesn\u2019t make her confident and driven.

{"Title": "Masterminds", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "If smart dumb comedies hold a place in your heart, you'll like \"Masterminds.\" The main characters are masterminds only in their own heads, and the thoughts that tumble out of their mouths are as nonsensical as they are sincere. The stupider the thought, the harder the joke lands. \"The Jerk,\" \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" \"Dumb and Dumber,\" \"Anchorman\" and other films all worked this vein. There's a whole glorious wing of smart-dumb that sends up crime pictures; the subgenre's peak practitioners are probably Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography is packed with dunderheaded crooks who can barely tie their shoes, yet fancy themselves geniuses.  Advertisement The Coens' early masterpiece \"Raizing Arizona\"\u2014the first of many botched kidnapping flicks by the Coens\u2014looms over \"Masterminds,\" a polished bit of silliness about a band of small-time South Carolina crooks who somehow pulled off the biggest cash heist in American history: the inside-job robbery of an armored car filled with $17 million in Loomis Fargo money. I didn't know any of the details of the actual case\u00a0going in and was startled to learn that aside from the film's goofy finale\u2014which I won't describe in detail because it's terrific\u2014a lot of the events that you'd assume were invented are drawn straight from life.  Of course all of those real details have been exaggerated and made grotesque or ludicrous, in manner of most \"Saturday Night Live\"-style, semi-improvised comedies; and many more incidents have been invented or embellished, the better to enable costars Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Jason Sudeikis, Owen Wilson and Leslie Jones to don wigs and facial appliances and trot out accents. In the end this is a film about dopes falling down, running into things, walking or running strangely, making sincere or \"menacing\" speeches that come out as word salad, and indulging in tender, even heartfelt exchanges that could have just as easily popped out of the mouths of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. The film's crackpot-innocent sensibility is encapsulated by a scene where Wiig's character Kelly Campbell, a former security company employee who was fired for incompetence, tries to convince an ex-coworker, Galfianakis' David Scott Ghantt, that she'll join him in Rio if he uses his keys to open a vault and steal cash from the company. David sheepishly replies that not only has he never traveled outside the country, he's only been to the airport a few times. \"It's a magical place,\" Kelly says, referring to Rio. \"Yeah,\" David says, \"all those planes landin' and takin' off and such.\"\u00a0 Advertisement David is sweet on Kelly, so he lets her entice him into meeting with the alleged mastermind of the heist, her friend Steve Chambers (Wilson), a pea-brain who dubs himself Geppetto because he's \"the guy pulling the strings.\" David sheepishly corrects him: he's thinking of another character from \"Pinocchio,\" Stromboli; Geppetto is actually the guy who built Pinocchio.\u00a0 You can tell by the way Steve tenses the back of his shoulders and neck that he hates being corrected. You can't see his face, though, because they're in a diner, and Steve is sitting one booth away with his back turned so David can't identify him.  \"Masterminds\" was written by Chris Bowman, Hubbell Palmer and Emily Spivey and directed by \"Napoleon Dynamite\" and \"Gentlemen Broncos\" filmmaker Jared Hess, \u00a0American cinema's second most distinguished practitioner of smart-stupid comedy after the Coens. This film is much bigger, broader and lighter than his usual and lacks his characteristic molasses-slow buildups and a certain spiritual quality; but visually and tonally it's in his wheelhouse. Most of the time in these kinds of films the notes of sweetness, naivete and regret feel forced, or else they don't mesh with the sorts of whopping sight gags that Hess stages here, including a mercifully brief explosion of diarrhea, a Buster Keaton-styled car chase through a Mexican town, and an extended scene of David loading the armored car with purloined money, making a series of stupid mistakes that jeopardize the operation.  Here, though, you believe the sweetness, because Hess and his cast sell it with poker faces. Kelly is a femme fatale of sorts, but because she doesn't grasp the full extent of the damage she's inflicted on David's life, you don't hate her; you just wait for the inevitable moment when she feels bad and tries to set things right. David, likewise, can't stay a schlub forever, even though he never realizes that his bangs, mustache and beard make him look like a Muppet. (He thinks everyone else looks ridiculous, at one point describing Steve as \"Ric Flair's little boy.\") You know he'll stand up and fight back at some point, and that when it does, it feels like an earned redemption rather than a plot obligation. Sudeikis' character, a hitman hired to kill David to stop him from spilling the beans to Jones' FBI agent, has an even stranger, bizarrely moving arc, one that I wouldn't dream of revealing here.  Advertisement The film is probably too long and sometimes too pleased with itself, and the structure and pacing are frustrating; not bad, just frustrating, because they prevent \"Masterminds\" from becoming truly excellent instead of consistently amusing and occasionally inspired. And it needed a lot more of McKinnon, whose scene-stealing turn as David's jilted fiance captures a particular type of mirthless optimist with spooky accuracy. (She's always announcing deep feelings through a set jaw, dead doll eyes flashing.)  Still, there's something inspiring about so many talented physical comics throwing themselves into roles that have moments of true emotion as well as countless opportunities to yammer, pratfall, bellow in rage, and thrash each other with whatever objects are in reach. Throughout, the movie keeps serving up grace notes that make the whole experience richer: Kelly soothing David on the phone by singing him tuneless vocal runs; a slow-motion shot of David strutting in a caballero outfit while clutching an elephant pinata; Sudeikis' assassin leaving a pile of cash for a friend and placing a tiny black sombrero on top of it like a paperweight. Another of David's blithering declarations of love for Kelly should've been the movie's tagline: \"Bonnie needs his Clyde.\"", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Hero of Color City", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "A little boy named Ben goes to sleep in his room, surrounded by his toys  and magnifying glass, his unfinished drawings and scattered crayons.  Once his eyes finally close, the crayons pop to life. They take  a roll call and then leap into their crayon box,  which acts as a psychedelically-colored wormhole leading to a place called  \"Color City,\" a land populated only by crayons. Color City is so  garishly colored that you ache for the grey crayon to bust a move and cover  it all with fog to give your eyes a break. \"The Hero of Color  City,\" directed by Frank Gladstone, feels as though it was written by a  committee, and so it's not a surprise to see five  screenwriters listed in the credits. Even if you allow for the the fact that the film is geared towards the 5-year-old set, it's still a pretty  dreary experience, made even more so by screamingly vivid colors, uninspiring animation and grating songs. Advertisement Each crayon has a distinct personality, and the only moments of  originality emerge from those quirks. There's the lead, Yellow  (Christina Ricci), who is scared of everything. Green (Jess Harnell) is a  boring fuddy-duddy who pontificates about everything. Brown (Tom  Lowell) is a cowboy with a thick white Sam Elliott mustache. Blue (Wayne  Brady) is extroverted and confident. Red (Rosie Perez) is hot-tempered  and feisty. The crayons compete over what Ben has \"used\" each of them  for in his various drawings. Poor Black (David Kaye) is the Eeyore of  the group, throwing in deadpan comments showing his bleak outlook: \"All  Ben ever uses me for is night.\" Or \"Once in a while, I'm an outline.\" At  least Black gets used. The white crayon's \"head\" is still a pointy tip  because Ben never uses White at all! Their nightly jaunts to Color City have seemingly no point except to  hang out with their own kind. They go visit a \"spa\" (run by a pink  crayon with a French accent) to get their tips re-shaped. They have to  be back before Ben wakes up, so they cram in as much Crayon-only time as  possible. But this particular trip to Color City goes awry because the  crayons are followed through the wormhole by two unfinished drawings of  Ben's, a giant king named King Scrawl and his flying round-bodied  sidekick named Gnat (Craig Ferguson). These unfinished drawings yearn to  be colored. It's not right that they remain just outlines. But the  residents of Color City treat these benign creatures as horrifying  interlopers, monsters that must be crushed and destroyed. There's quite a bit of plot, and \"The Hero of Color City\" gets bogged  down in it, lacking the imagination to create something alive. The  \"monsters\" try to get the attention of the crayons by clogging up the  Rainbow Waterfall, the source of all the color in Color City. The  situation is dire. Without color, who would the crayons be? Of what use  will they be anymore if they fade? They band together and set out on a  \"Heart of Darkness\" type journey on a boat, to bring down the monsters  causing so much trouble. What is the story here? Not the plot, but the  story. It seems that \"The Hero of Color City\" wants, ultimately, to be  about how Yellow has to stop being \"yellow\", get over her fear of  everything and rise to the occasion courageously. Will she succeed? Will  she fail? But Yellow isn't a character. She's just a character trait.  And the film doesn't give the journey (actual and emotional) any sense  of high stakes. It's all just one thing happening after another,  interspersed by chirpy repetitive songs. Advertisement All of the characters are so one-note that the movie becomes formulaic almost  instantly. Some big event goes down, and inevitably we get Yellow  cringing in the corner, Blue cracking a joke, Black moaning about how  they are all doomed, Red making some feisty comment, and Brown trying to  round them all up with a lasso of commands. One need only consider \"Toy Story\"\u2014with its depth of characterization, its  life-or-death stakes, and age-appropriate humor  that ends up working for all ages\u2014to remember that films for children  do not need to be so simplistic.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Complete Unknown", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cComplete Unknown\u201d has a killer opening sequence. Two young\r\nwomen, their faces tantalizingly kept out of frame much of the time, discuss a\r\nnew living arrangement for one of the women, who\u2019s back from a long time away,\r\nin an exotic location, where, she says, she worked with some \u201camazing\r\nbotanists.\u201d That woman, glimpsed in profile, is recognizable as Rachel Weisz.\r\nSo, too, is the compassionate and competent hospital nurse seen in a couple of\r\nfollowing shots. So, too, is the magician\u2019s assistant working in a Chinese\r\nnightclub in the next few shots. So, too, is the somberly dressed woman sitting\r\nin a car parked outside of a suburban house, watching as an older woman drives\r\nher car out of the driveway and away from that house. Is this a woman with a\r\nlot of careers? Is this a clone? Advertisement Next we\u2019re in a New York office and characters Tom (Michael\r\nShannon) and Clyde (Michael Chernus) are discussing a matter of some import;\r\nTom is drafting a sort of codicil to a piece of proposed legislation, and is\r\nconcerned about \u201cfall grazing trends,\u201d and because he\u2019s Michael Shannon, his\r\nconcern is pretty intense. In short order, Weisz\u2019s character is seen doing\r\nonline research about the sandy-haired, goateed, slightly pudgy Clyde, and\r\ninsinuating herself into his attentions by way of an obviously engineered\r\nmeet-cute in Clyde\u2019s office cafeteria. The viewer will have more questions now:\r\nis Weisz someone who engages in some sort of corporate espionage, hence all of\r\nher personae?\u00a0 The answers are not too long in coming, and without giving too\r\nmuch away, \u201cComplete Unknown\u201d unspools as more of a chamber drama than a\r\nthriller. The picture is co-written and directed by Joshua Marston, who\u2019s\r\nworked a lot in television in recent years but whose feature film career has a\r\ndistinguishing characteristic which is defined by the fact that this picture is\r\nthe California-born filmmaker\u2019s first full-length movie in English. His 2004\r\nfeature debut \u201cMaria Full of Grace\u201d was mostly in Spanish, and 2011\u2019s striking,\r\nunderseen \u201cThe Forgiveness of Blood\u201d was set and shot in Albania. The milieu of\r\n\u201cComplete Unknown\u201d has an internationalist bent; Tom\u2019s wife, Ramina (Azita Ghanizada), is\r\nPersian, and is informally tutoring Tom in Farsi; everyone in Tom\u2019s circle is\r\nwell-traveled, as is \u201cAlice,\u201d who comes to Tom\u2019s birthday party as Clyde\u2019s\r\nplatonic date. This new persona of Weisz\u2019s claims to have just come in from\r\nTasmania, where she\u2019s been working with a newly discovered species of toad.\r\nTom, however, recognizes someone wholly other in Alice.  At a certain point, the character Weisz plays reminded me of\r\na less score-settling version of, well, Alice, the persona-shifting sometime\r\nstripper from Mike Nichols\u2019 2004 \u201cCloser,\u201d adapted by Patrick Marber from his\r\nplay. As Tom and \u201cAlice\u201d separate themselves from Tom\u2019s social circle to sort\r\nthings out, Weisz\u2019s character explains to Tom that the way she morphs from\r\nperson to person has been a liberation for her: \u201cI could be anyone I wanted.\u201d A\r\nchance encounter on the street with an older woman walking her dog (Kathy\r\nBates) ends in a mishap that compels Tom and Alice to escort the woman back to\r\nher home, where they meet her husband (Danny Glover). There, \u201cAlice\u201d gives Tom\r\nan object lesson in impersonation by passing him off to the couple as an\r\nosteopath, and he performs a credible diagnosis on Bates\u2019 character in a sequence that\u2019s both suspenseful and\r\nmordantly funny, one that is brought off beautifully by the four expert actors.\u00a0 Advertisement Marston\u2019s screenplay, co-written with Julian Sheppard, is sharp and has a nice\r\nnumber of twists. His directing style here is intriguing. Shooting in\r\nwidescreen, he often maintains an almost claustrophobically shallow focus, and\r\nplaces what would customarily be crucial points of interest near the edge of\r\nthe frame. It\u2019s a good strategy for keeping the viewer a little off balance.\r\nAnd a tight frame also has the added benefit of masking a tight budget,\r\nalthough to tell the truth I did notice when the golden retriever that Bates\u2019\r\ncharacter was walking completely\r\nvanished as soon as Bates, Weisz and Shannon entered the Bates\u2019 character\u2019s\r\napartment building. The movie does pretty well as a treatment of identity and\r\nselfhood in a social landscape that grows increasingly alienating as it becomes more transparent. But it somehow\r\nfails to wholly satisfy. And as killer\r\nas the opening sequence is, the movie\u2019 final shot is a disquieting dud: it is practically (color values aside) a\r\nreplica of the final shot of the aforementioned \u201cCloser.\u201d Which is not to say\r\nthat Marston lifted it; for all I know he\u2019s never even seen the movie. It\u2019s\r\nmore likely that the observation that motivated the shot was exactly the same,\r\nwhich leads me to question the ultimate value of the sentiment.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Enemies Closer", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "If \"Enemies Closer\" had been made 20 years ago, it would have quickly\u00a0vanished from theaters, replayed endlessly on HBO, and inspired the next generation of critics to call it a neglected gem, not because it's especially good, but because it stars an aging action star, has a couple of perverse elements, and is directed by a filmmaker with a cult following:\u00a0Peter Hyams.\u00a0The former cinematographer emerged in the 1980s and '90s with a string of action and sci-fi pictures that were visually sumptuous but dramatically just OK: \"Outland,\" \"Running Scared,\" \"2010,\" \"Timecop,\" \"Sudden Death.\" Those last two starred Jean-Claude Van Damme, whose work as the villain in \"Enemies Closer\" is the only reason to see this film\u2014unless you're also a devotee of Hyams' son John, who edited the picture and has carved out his own notable career as an action stylist (his last two \"Universal Soldier\" sequels merged imaginatively choreographed butt kicking with arthouse strangeness).\u00a0 Advertisement Van Damme plays\u00a0Xander, a French-Canadian drug dealer who sneaks a bunch of narco-thugs dressed as Canadian Mounties across the border. They're here to reclaim a heroin shipment that sank to the bottom of a lake along with the plane that carried it. Xander bears no relation to any real-world drug dealer. He's a sadistic wraith in the vein of Martin Scorsese's Max Cady and Heath Ledger's Joker. He lectures his men about veganism and global footprints. His\u00a0wavy orange slicked-back hair suggests Christopher Walken impersonating a troll doll. He knocks on the front door of a Drug Enforcement Agency border station with the nonchalance of Bugs Bunny asking to borrow a cup of sugar from Elmer Fudd and proceeds to kill everyone in the place. He's not above using guns but prefers not to, because barehanded murder is more of a challenge. (There's a marvelous early moment in which an especially tough DEA agent seems to be holding his own against Xander, and one of Xander's colleagues offers to help, only to be waved away.)\u00a0 Van Damme's English is less intelligible than usual, and his line readings are sluggish in places. Improbably enough, this adds to the performance, perhaps because it sets the star apart from all the other actors who've opted to deliver their lines comprehensibly and with passion. At times his work here suggests the action star version of a late-period Marlon Brando performance, wherein the performer's evident inability to give a damn got folded into the character, making him seem more special than he might have otherwise. There's a parallel story involving good guys who are at each other's throats, then have to team up and fight Xander's gang. One is the park ranger\u00a0Henry (Tom Everett Scott), a former Navy diver who's haunted by his experience in Afghanistan. The other is Clay (Orlando Jones), a former soldier and ex-con who's come to Henry's remote island to avenge the death of his brother, who served under Henry during the war. Like everyone else who isn't named Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott and Jones behave as if they're in a modest shoot 'em up that isn't winking at the audience. They play their roles earnestly and with flashes of wit (the best of these is Scott's imagined conversation with a rude old man who rebuffed his attempt to be neighborly). Their straightforward approach contrasts intriguingly with Van Damme's exhausted decadence and makes them seem confident and strong. Whether they're acting against him or fighting against him, they never seem overmatched. Advertisement Neither the elder Hyams' direction nor the younger Hyams' editing rise to the level of their best work. The cutting in the fight scenes is more choppy than clever, and aside from a few elegantly composed wide shots and a somewhat daring (for an action film) use of darkness, the action is too plainly shot, at times veering close to the boringly anonymous \"coverage\" style of moviemaking that both father and son rightly decry. But there are at least two setpieces that are keepers, and even when the film's energy flags, Van Damme boosts it again by breaking a neck, muttering about sustainable resources, or just sitting there thinking about whatever it is that Xander thinks about. \"Timecop,\" maybe.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Polina", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "You can pick them out of a crowd, walking around Lincoln Center, crammed onto the 1 or 9 trains among the everyday commuters. Hair pulled back sleekly, erect postures, small bodies, heads up from the neck. They're ballet dancers, swarming into New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theater, lugging duffel bags almost larger than they are. They've got that ballet look, from a lifetime spent at the barre, forcing their bodies to do the impossible. The opening scenes of \"Polina,\" co-directed by collaborators Valerie Muller and world-renowned French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, thrust you into the world where the majority of a dancer's life is spent: in class. It is a humorless world, nothing peripheral allowed, just the body straining against gravity. Advertisement \"Polina,\" based on the graphic novel by Bastien Vives, focuses on the nitty-gritty of life as a dancer: sweaty classrooms, pianist in the corner, bleeding feet, intimidating teachers, the sheer pressure of a pursuit so rigorous that \"making it\" barely exists. It's like qualifying for the Olympics. When \"Polina\" stays focused on dance, it soars. When it strays into the personal life of its lead, it moves almost compulsively into cliche. Since every single scene includes dance in some way (either in class, or out in the world), the ship stays upright the majority of the time. As a non-dancer but dance enthusiast, I was thrilled to these beautifully shot dance scenes, each unique in its own way. The diverse world of dance and the pursuit itself: that's what \"Polina\" is about. Polina (Veronika Zhovnytska) is first seen as a little girl, tramping through the snow in the shadow of a belching nuclear power plant in the industrial outskirts of Moscow to her ballet school run by an exacting teacher named Bojinsky (Aleksey Guskov). His choreography had been too political for the Soviet era, and he has suffered the consequences. Now, he watches over his child students with a sharp eye, pushing their backs in, yanking their legs higher, a perfectionist. The students' ability to focus, to push through pain, to endure criticism, is adult in nature. Polina lives at home with her parents, who have pinned all of their hopes on their daughter rising through the ranks of the most competitive ballet culture in the world. Walking home from class by herself in the twilight, Polina lets loose, music seguing from classical piano into a thrumming club beat as she dances wildly, her boots kicking up snow, a scene prophetic of things to come. (The film's score is by 79D, suggestive of Polina's yearning to be free of her ballet training.) Anastasia Shevtsova (a dancer with the Saint Petersburg Mariinsky Theater) plays Polina as a teenager, accepted into the legendary Bolshoi Ballet, and dating a visiting French dancer, played by Niels Schneider. The two go to a modern dance recital, and Polina is rocked to the core by the passionate intimacy expressed between the dancers onstage. Impulsively, Polina follows her boyfriend to France to audition for a famous choreographer's company. Juliette Binoche plays the choreographer, Liria Elsaj, whose dance style is heavy, \"grounded,\" filled with plunges into the floor, very different from the rising-up illusion of effortlessness required by ballet. Liria says to Polina, \"My work is about longing.\" Binoche, in a casual sweat suit, is believable as a dancer, as well as a woman with a unique vision. Her gaze is assessing, sometimes merciless, a gaze from which Polina cannot hide. Advertisement Much of the film is shot in intimate handheld style by cinematographer Georges Lechaptois. The dance classes are a flurry of arms, necks, legs, feet. But there are formal moments, where Lechaptois pulls back and lets us see the dance unfold in full, with no cuts. So many current dance movies are cut in a music video style, forgetting that part of the beauty of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' dances (to give just one example) stemmed from the fact that they were filmed in full-body shots, the camera gliding with the duo. Lechaptois lets us see the dancer's bodies in full, with no trickery via editing. There are exhilarating moments when the camera is still: a closeup of Polina's feet in toe shoes, up on pointe, and down: the convex shapes her feet make. One of the most memorable scenes is an overhead shot of a tutu-ed ballerina dancing an entire sequence, her white costume stark against the black floor and black curtains. The film's narrative is a mosaic, a Girl in Search of a Dance Company. This journey takes her from Russia, to France, to Antwerp. At one point, she pairs up with Jeremie Belingard, a beautiful dancer with a kind humorous face. There's a breathless scene where they improvise a pas de deux along the river in Antwerp, their bodies black against the vivid winter sunset. Polina sees dance everywhere: girls in bars, a rapturous hug in a subway tunnel, the grasping body of a homeless man. Muller and Preljocaj allows us to see how a dancer thinks and sees: human bodies moving through space, and the displacement of air that creates. These are all wonderful scenes, although Polina\u2014and her life\u2014remain a cipher. It's not clear what is missing\u00a0in her, although teachers and choreographers sense it. She throws a lot of tantrums. She doesn't have defining characteristics. Liria clocks Polina's self-involvement. These observations are dispersed, though, in the cliched narrative about an innocent girl lost in a big city, maybe falling in with the wrong crowd, drinking, smoking, etc. In the scenes outside the dance world, the film reverts to a simplistic YA novel or ABC after-school special. Advertisement The most important thing \"Polina\" does\u2014and it is testament, again, to the involvement of Preljocaj, a man who has devoted his life to dance\u2014is that it shows that the everyday life of an artist is not made up of catharsis and accomplishment, triumphs and breakthroughs. Those moments only come after years of hard work, of failing and trying again. This is an element of art it is difficult for \"civilians\" to understand sometimes. There's an incredible sequence showing this in eloquent fragments: Polina waitressing, Polina in the dance studio, Polina flopping into bed, Polina shoveling food into her mouth, Polina waitressing, Polina dancing, Polina flopping into bed ... It's never-ending and it tells the whole story. Dance is not about the results. It is about the process. \"Polina\" is precious for that aspect alone.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Ex Libris: New York Public Library", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "There is no American nonfiction filmmaker as simultaneously difficult and accessible as 86-year old Frederick Wiseman, whose 44th film, the documentary \u201cEx Libris: New York Public Library,\u201d opens this week at Film Forum in New York City. All of Wiseman\u2019s movies use a variation of a strategy he\u2019s been employing since the late 1960s, when he broke through with \u201cTiticut Follies,\u201d about a mental hospital; \u201cBasic Training,\u201d about the U.S. Army during the Vietnam war, and \u201cHigh School,\u201d about public education. Wiseman chooses a subject, usually an institution that\u2019s either resisting change or leaning into it. Then he explores it with multiple cameras, watching what happens in and around various rooms and buildings, generating mountains of raw footage (during the days of celluloid film; now it\u2019s hard drives full of video), then goes into the editing room and figures out how to arrange it all.\u00a0 Advertisement   Every documentary practices a version of that process, of course. But Wiseman\u2019s approach feels more immediate and unadorned. And now that more and more documentarians are shaping their work to resemble fiction films\u2014aping the structure of the muckraking TV expose, the heist thriller, the war movie, the sports film and so on\u2014his approach feels stubbornly retro. Many of his documentaries run between two and four hours. There are sequences that spend several minutes watching people talking to each other, or failing to communicate. But then you settle into the peculiar rhythm of the thing and realize that there\u2019s a subtle, intuitive structure to the way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and so on. The editing doesn\u2019t make blatant arguments, but it does suggest ways of seeing. \u00a0 \u00a0   Clocking in at three hours and seventeen minutes, \u201cEx Libris\u201d at first seems like one of his least polished films. There are long scenes where speakers address crowds, moderators interview famous people on stages, anonymous citizens clean floors, advise tourists and sift through microfilm, and administrators argue about funding and policy behind closed doors (a process that nearly always boils down figuring out how to do more with less). Almost every scene changes direction or tone several times, to the point where you can imagine a rhetoric teacher shouting, \u201cDigression!\u201d\u00a0   An early sequence shows Khalil Gibran Muhammad, director of Harlem\u2019s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, speaking to a crowd at Macomb\u2019s Bridge branch, a quarter mile north of the main branch on 42nd Street (the one with the lions). Muhammad talks for a while about the lived experience of poverty in communities of color. Then he segues into a freewheeling gripe session about how state-approved textbooks oversimplify or distort history. This same film shows celebrities, including rock stars Elvis Costello and Patti Smith and essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates, visiting major branches to speak to crowds. We also meet an author in a small lecture hall who notes that, while there are countless books and films about the first wave of European Jewish migrants settling on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, there aren\u2019t nearly as many about the second generation, which deserted urban centers for the suburbs after World War II, taking their culture with them. This morphs into a slide show about the Jewish deli as cultural center. The photos cover the first half of the 20th century.\u00a0 Advertisement   I\u2019m pretty sure the author described in that last bit is Ted Merwin, and the book is Pastrami on Rye: An Overstuffed History of the Jewish Deli in America. I say \u201cpretty sure\u201d because Wiseman doesn\u2019t identify people with title cards like 99% of documentarians. Some consider this an irritating affectation, but it\u2019s part of Wiseman\u2019s method. His films encourage viewers to consider what\u2019s happening right in front of your eyes, at that moment, then jump way back, putting that moment in a big-picture context. \u00a0   What\u2019s key here is the idea of the library changing, in the digital era, so that it\u2019s less focused on physical books, printed on paper and filed according to the Dewey Decimal System, and more concerned with the exchange of information. It\u2019s a an intellectual and cultural circulatory system akin to subways, highways and water pipes. People of every social class, ethnicity and race can go to libraries to find the information they want or need and exchange information with others.\u00a0   This idea of the library as cultural hub connects with every scene in the movie, from the lecture about the central cultural importance of the deli in Jewish urban life to Costello discussing the role of the singer-songwriter in shaping political attitudes; a group of art students searching through image files containing photos and illustrations that have been grouped by situation as well as subject; firefighters and border patrol officers hyping their professions during a jobs fair at a Bronx branch, and Muhammad describing how public school textbooks distort students\u2019 perceptions of slavery.   This is not one of Wiseman\u2019s most meticulously structured recent works. It\u2019s not as searing and revelatory as his two \u201cDomestic Violence\u201d documentaries set in shelters for battered women, as compact and intimate as his 2010 classic \u201cBoxing Gym,\u201d or as symphonic as \u201cIn Jackson Heights,\u201d a portrait of a Queens neighborhood that bears favorable comparison to \u201cOur Town\u201d and \u201cBerlin: Symphony of a Great City.\u201d There are extended sections where the film just seems to give itself over to whomever\u2019s onscreen, fixating on them like library patrons who ought to be moving along but can\u2019t bear to tear themselves away from a particular speaker, coffee table book, or vintage magazine. (\u201cEx Libris\u201d seems to acknowledge that Wiseman\u2019s approach here might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea: there are regular cutaways to people texting, zoning out, even napping.) Advertisement   But the film\u2019s boundless enthusiasm for the idea of the library wins the day. \u201cEx Libris\u201d portrays the New York Public Library system, and by extension all such systems, as a benevolent force in public life, pushing back against anti-intellectual attitudes, breaking down social barriers, and fostering a sense of community in a time of technologically induced loneliness and narcissism. The idea of \u201ccommunication\u201d\u2014what it means to get your point across, and why some people do a better job of it than others\u2014gets explored through Wiseman\u2019s freewheeling juxtaposition of speakers. Some are so charismatic or charming that they could hold your full attention if they were reading the ingredients on the back of a cereal box. Others can barely get through a sentence without stumbling over their words, or letting their anxiety or enthusiasm overwhelm whatever they\u2019re trying to say. They\u2019re all circulating through Wiseman\u2019s movie, like books that make a brief appearance in one branch, then get whisked off to another.   Most importantly, \u201cEx Libris\u201d is filled with cool stuff that you\u2019ll want to tell other people about. I still haven\u2019t gotten over learning about how, in the pre-Internet days, illustrators might go to the library and say, \u201cI need pictures of dogs in motion, for a magazine illustration I\u2019m supposed to draw,\u201d and a clerk would go, um, fetch a file containing said images: like Google, but with people. This is not a hypothetical description, by the way. Wiseman makes sure to give you close-ups of images in the dog file. There\u2019s a whole other movie in there, one of dozens in this endearing shaggy dog of a documentary.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Love & Mercy", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The most heartening surprise about director Bill Pohlad\u2019s\r\n\u201cLove and Mercy\u201d is also to my mind a pretty improbable one. That is, that it\u2019s\r\nsuch a good and at times better than good movie. The rise and fall and rise and\r\nfall and rise of genius musician Brian Wilson, a life story that disproves\r\nFitzgerald\u2019s adage about there being no second acts in America in what seems like\r\nthe most perverse way imaginable, looks on paper to be too sprawling, too\r\nchaotic, to be distilled into a coherent, never mind compelling, cinematic\r\nnarrative of conventional length.  Advertisement But longtime producer Pohlad (\u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d \u201c12\r\nYears A Slave\u201d), working from a daring\r\nscript by Oren Moverman and Michael Alan Lerner, and using two first-rate\r\nactors to play Wilson at two turning points in his life, lavishes his material\r\nwith love, attention to detail, and empathetic imagination. The result is a\r\nstory that\u2019s hair-raisingly watchable and frequently moving, regardless of what\r\nyou believe you might already know of Wilson\u2019s life.  The movie shuttles back and forth between two distinct\r\nperiods. In the mid \u201860s, Paul Dano\u2019s Wilson is the baby-faced\r\nmusical genius of the Beach Boys who\u2019s burning out on the road life. He\u2019s got\r\nthis amazing music in his head, and he manages to get quite a bit of it out,\r\ndespite the resentful sniping of his abusive ex-manager father, the hostility\r\nof at least one bandmate who doesn\u2019t get why Brian isn\u2019t writing more hits, and\r\nan increasingly fragile psychic state that is not helped by an exposure to LSD.\r\nCusack plays the Wilson of the late '80s, supposedly brought back from a\r\ncomplete psychotic break by psychological miracle worker Dr. Eugene Landy, who\r\nbecame such a part of Wilson\u2019s life that he presumed to make himself a partner\r\nin the creation of Wilson\u2019s music. John Cusack\u2019s Wilson wanders desultorily\r\ninto a Cadillac dealership (although we soon see he\u2019s got a bodyguard trailing\r\nhim, and a mini-entourage trailing the bodyguard), charms attractive young\r\nsalesperson Melinda (Elizabeth Banks), who at first has no idea who the sweetly\r\neccentric fellow is. After telling her he wants the car in which they\u2019ve stolen\r\na few precious moments removed from the outside world, he scrawls on her\r\nbusiness card and leaves it on the steering wheel of the car. The words he\u2019s\r\nwritten are \u201cLonely/Frightened/Scared.\u201d Landy, played with terrifying intensity and smarm by Paul\r\nGiamatti, has by this point in time morphed from someone in service of Wilson\r\nto a malignant Svengali. His monstrous manipulations are bad enough in\r\nisolation, but when intercut with scenes of the younger Wilson shrinking at the\r\ndisapprobation of the father\u2014who beat him to deafness in one ear, but from whom Brian still craves approval\u2014or the\r\ncousin/bandmate who hectors him over jokey song lyrics and musical direction,\r\nthey are genuinely heart-rending and angering. The movie creates a rather\r\neffective suspense story: as Melinda gets closer and closer to Brian, under\r\nLandy\u2019s paranoid gaze, one wonders just how much fortitude Mr. Wilson\u2019s new\r\nlove interest has, and if she has that fortitude, can she get what she needs to\r\ndeliver Brian from what he describes as his \u201chell.\u201d It gets pretty tense.  Meanwhile, back in the \u201860s, Pohlad and Dano and a host of excellent supporting players simulate the creation of such ground-breaking pop works as Pet Sounds and \u201cGood Vibrations.\u201d Usually fictionalized scenes of music-making are as convincing as cinematic depictions of painters painting (that is, not at all), so the very compelling scenes in which young Brian corrals the crack L.A. session players known as \u201cThe Wrecking Crew\u201d into accepting and then conjuring his sometimes eccentric musical visions feel almost miraculous. And Banks, who brings equal notes of beauty-queen sunniness and Girl Scout rectitude to her portrayal of Melinda (who did, spoiler alert, become Mrs. Wilson after the events depicted in this film) has an interesting chemistry with the haltingly charming and sometimes tragically wrung-out Cusack. Advertisement \n The movie isn\u2019t perfect: the hairpiece Giamatti sports throughout is so unconvincing that the filmmakers ought to have found away to make a joke of it. But even when Pohlad puts a foot wrong, he does so in an interesting way. This isn\u2019t the kind of movie in which you expect to find a resonating allusion to \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d and yet there one is. And while I have to say it didn\u2019t quite work for me, I\u2019ve got to give Pohlad credit for nerve. In any event, there\u2019s more than enough of real value in the movie in spite of that. Not just its content, but its bedrock belief in people, in spite of all the awful things people can do. This philosophy is also a big part of Wilson\u2019s music, a point that\u2019s brought home as the end titles roll.", "Critic": "Gamma"}

At\r\n140 minutes, Kim sometimes loses the rhythm of his spy thriller, but he's such\r\na confident filmmaker\u2014and his leading man such a magnetic presence\u2014that he\r\nquickly gets its back. \u201cThe Age of Shadows\u201d may not be among its filmmaker\u2019s best works (I\r\nadore \u201cGood,\u201d \u201cA Tale of Two Sisters,\u201d and the vicious \u201cI Saw the Devil\u201d) but\r\nit\u2019s not for lack of ambition or scope.  Advertisement \u201cThe Age of Shadows\u201d opens with a meeting between a fighter\r\nfor the Korean resistance against the Japanese occupation (the film takes place\r\nin 1920s Korea) and an antiques dealer. As the fighter is trying to sell an item\r\nto raise funds for the resistance, it becomes clear something is wrong.\r\nBefore you know it, dozens of police officers descend upon the place and a chase\r\nensues that sets the stage for the two hours to come, in that it\u2019s a situation\r\nthat looks horribly out of balance\u2014one man trying to escape an army. That army\r\nis led by Lee Jung-chool (the great Song Kang-Ho), who seems to be the only one\r\ntrying to take the target alive\u2014again setting up his character as someone stuck\r\nbetween immovable forces. After the freedom fighter is injured so badly that he\r\nliterally twists his own toe off, he kills himself. This will be a film about men willing to die for that which they believe in, and how impossible that kind of commitment can be to stop. Much like \u201cGood,\u201d \u201cThe Age of Shadows\u201d develops into a\r\nthree-character piece. There\u2019s Lee, the Korean captain working for the Japanese\r\npolice, who becomes sympathetic to the causes and the people behind the\r\nresistance he\u2019s been assigned to stopping; there\u2019s Kim Woo-jin (Gong Yoo,\r\nrecently seen in \u201cTrain to Busan\u201d), the new leader of the resistance; and there\u2019s\r\nthe Japanese agent Hashimoto (Um Tae-goo), who often looks like he\u2019d be willing\r\nto kill an entire train of people just to stop one resistance fighter. The fact\r\nthat Hashimoto and his vicious superior are sketched as near-sociopathic men,\r\nwilling to do whatever it takes to stop the insurgence, makes Lee\u2019s interest in\r\nthe other side believable. It doesn\u2019t hurt that the director gives Kim a minor\r\nlove story\u2014he\u2019s fallen hard for Yun Gye-Soon, the heroine of the resistance, played by Han\r\nJi-min\u2014thereby humanizing him even further. There is a lot of\r\ndiscussion of informants and double agents in \u201cThe Age of Shadows,\u201d to the\r\npoint that story often gets muddled and the actual stakes feel\r\nlessened. Kim works primarily in action outbursts\u2014a train centerpiece, the\r\nhighlight of the film, puts all the good guys and bad guys on board and then\r\nslow-burns to its explosive climax. By defining Lee\u2019s loyalties as seriously\r\nunclear at this point and then putting spies, police officers and a ton of\r\nexplosives on a train to Seoul, Kim\u2019s film justifies the cost of admission in\r\njust the train sequence alone. It\u2019s beautifully conceived, framed and executed.\r\nOutside of that, there are a few extended scenes, but calling this an action\r\nfilm would be misleading.  Advertisement While Kim\u2019s filmmaking is typically engaging, it\u2019s really\r\nSong Kang-ho who carries the viewer\u2019s interest. Gong Yoo may get the more traditional hero\r\nrole, but it\u2019s important to the director that we see this story through the eyes of\r\nthe man caught in the middle. The star of \u201cThirst\u201d and \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d is\r\ntypically fantastic, a man conflicted enough to question the role he\u2019ll play in\r\na formative chapter of his country\u2019s history. Everyone here is good, although I\r\ndo wish some of the supporting characters had been fleshed out a bit more. We\r\nknow almost nothing about Yun Gye-Soon outside of the love-struck\r\neyes given her by Kim Woo-jin and a visually striking sequence in the train\r\nstation. When her torture becomes a key, disturbing event in the final act, it\r\nlacks resonance because of how little we know about her. Although perhaps that\u2019s part of the point. None of these\r\npeople knew much about each other, or even themselves. \u201cThe Age of Shadows\u201d is\r\nabout a man caught between country and duty; decency and obligation.

{"Title": "Art Bastard", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "One of the defining moments of artist Robert Cenedella's life was when he learned at age six that he was illegitimate. Cenedella said that from that point on he felt like an outsider in his own family, thinking, \"I'm not really one of them.\" Being \"not one of them\" has also been his relationship with the official \"art world,\" where he remains virtually ignored. Cenedella's outsider status seems to suit him just fine. In the mainstream art world, a painting's artistic worth is determined by the dollar-value attached to it, and Cenedella says, \"There is no word to describe my feeling for the art world. I despise it.\" \"Art Bastard,\" Victor Kanefsky's engaging and thought-provoking documentary about Cenedella, is a beautiful portrait of the man himself, still going strong at age 76, as well as a critique of the art world that has ignored him (and others) because they don't \"fit.\" Advertisement Cenedella's gigantic paintings are crammed end to end with people. They show New York City in all its cacophony and chaos (his paintings seem to have sound; you can almost hear people screaming, subway trains roaring by, taxis honking). In works like \"2nd Avenue,\" \"Red Light\" and \"42nd Street,\" Cenedella takes the already-strange urban environment, where you see crazy things happen every day, and twists it into satire, irony and humor. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective), Cenedella started painting during the rise of abstract expressionism, with artists like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko becoming gigantic stars. Suddenly, \"representation\" was out. People vanished from paintings. There was no place for Cenedella's jostling street scenes with their biting satire in that environment. Cenedella says, \"Abstract expressionism negated anyone who had a point of view.\" This situation leads to deeper and more urgent questions, questions that course through \"Art Bastard\" like quicksilver: Who is it that decides what qualifies as art? Who is it that says, \"This is 'in' now, and that is 'out'\"? And how dare they? Cenedella says that it is \"mediocrity [the gallery owners] deciding the fate of geniuses.\" Kanefsky's interview subjects, Cenedella himself, museum and gallery owners, art historians, friends, all testify to the issues in the art world, a world focused more on buying and selling than anything else, where people buy paintings as investments that they hope to cash in in the future. They may not even like the paintings they buy. In that degraded environment, good work, challenging work, or even just work that doesn't \"fit\" with what is dictated, randomly, as \"in\" or \"hip,\" is ignored entirely. One of the most fortunate accidents of Cenedella's life came when he was still a teenager and he enrolled in the Art Students League in New York, landing in a painting class taught by George Grosz, the German artist and caricaturist whose heyday had been in the Weimar Republic. Grosz was a socially conscious and political artist, a vicious satirist, lampooning fat cats, the rich, the powerful. He watched the rise of Nazism and heard the warning bell for what it was. His wonderful work has also suffered from severe official neglect. A troubled man, Grosz was the perfect teacher for a rebel like Cenedella, who had been expelled from high school for not signing a Loyalty Oath, whose father had been targeted by the HUAC and who refused to answer any questions. Cenedella says, \"[Grosz] taught me how to draw and he taught me how to drink.\" Advertisement Cenedella's inspirations for his own work are people like Grosz, Grant Wood, George Bellows and Rockwell Kent's illustrations for Melville's \"Moby Dick.\" He would go to the Met and stand in front of Pieter Bruegel's \"The Harvesters,\" saying, \"I could never see enough of it.\" (A really helpful choice made by Kanefsky is to end the film with a credit-roll of the paintings mentioned throughout.) The social and political protest art of the 1930s were inspirations to Cenedella, art that portrayed real-life issues like bread lines, racial tension, poverty, unrest. And so Cenedella's work, as funny and engaging and eye-catching as it is, was perceived as old-fashioned, not as \"now\" as, say, Jackson Pollock. But Cenedella jokes, \"I consider myself a contemporary painter because I am painting today.\" One of the best parts of Kanefsky's approach is the way he allows the camera to wander through Cenedella's paintings, moving from face to face to face. The works are so large, so rich with imagery, that they are very difficult (impossible, really) to take in at one glance. The magnifying-glass approach helps illuminate the sheer amount of information in any given painting. Cenedella's paintings are funny. They're funny when you look at them from a distance, but they're even funnier when you get in close. They are personal, political, social. He's a critic, but he's not a humorless one. He is in a long tradition of social satirists, caricaturists, absurdists and cartoonists. One of \"Art Bastard\"'s greatest assets is that it contextualizes Robert Cenedella's work, placing him in the proper framework to understand his importance. Another asset is Cenedella himself, a lovely interview subject, an insightful and funny narrator of his own life.\u00a0 The conservative art world makes decisions on what to show and who to celebrate. It's the most rigid high school clique on the planet. Cenedella makes it clear that \"it's not what they show that bothers me. It's what they don't show.\" He wells up with tears when he talks of the death of his mentor, George Grosz, and the fact that Grosz died thinking of himself as a failure. Grosz painted what he saw in his world, and what he saw was disturbing and dismaying. His 1920 \"Republican Automatons,\" for example, cracks open the edifice of a political and social system with brutal efficiency. Work like that is not ingratiating or flattering to the viewer; it speaks the truth beneath the official version of the truth. Cenedella has also tried to speak the truth beneath the truth in his work and \"Art Bastard\" is a fitting tribute to him. As Grosz once said, \"Great art must be discernible to everyone.\" Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Love & Friendship", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Love & Friendship\" feels like it was inevitable. The director Whit Stillman adapting Jane Austen is one of those ideas that sounds like it's made up because it's so perfect, like Wes Anderson announcing that he's going to make an animated film about foxes based on a book by Roald Dahl. What's wonderful isn't just that he's doing it, but that doing it makes certain aspects of his talent official. You could even say it's a wonder that it didn't happen sooner, or that, in his own way, he's already been doing it for years.\u00a0 Advertisement Stillman's films, which include \"Metropolitan,\" \"Barcelona,\" \"The Last Days of Disco\" and \"Damsels in Distress,\" are comedies of manners, about educated, often hyper-verbal people who are oblivious to how ridiculous they sound (even when discussing Austen's \"Mansfield Park,\" as they do in \"Metropolitan\"). They pursue romantic partners that are wrong for them, suffer through relationships that are wrong for them, remain oblivious to better matches that are right in front of them. Throughout, the more brazen or ambitious characters run roughshod over people who have, well, manners. That describes a fair bit of Austen as well, although you might not necessarily know it from adaptations that concentrate on romance at the expense of comedy. Stillman doesn't make that mistake. \"Love & Friendship,\" about a scheming widow who tries to insinuate herself into a man's life, is based on a comparatively little-known and unfinished novella titled \"Lady Susan\" that wasn't published until after Austen's death. Most of the time, though, Austen-isms walk shoulder to shoulder with Stillman-isms so gracefully that it takes a moment to realize which author is likely speaking through these characters. It's a richly funny people-watching film, one that happens to contain possible romantic pairings.\u00a0 Kate Beckinsale, so delightful in Stillman's \"The Last Days of Disco,\" returns here as Lady Susan Vernon, who recently lost her husband and is determined to find a new one for herself as well as for her daughter\u00a0Frederica (Morfydd Clark), whom Susan frankly does not seem to appreciate or even like. Her target is\u00a0Reginald De Courcy (Xavier Samuel), whom she meets while visiting the estate of her in-laws.. As Susan circles the poor man like a hawk, she also tries to facilitate the union of Federica and the exuberantly thick-headed\u00a0Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett), even though Federica doesn't particularly care for him. Susan's confidant through all this is a Yankee,\u00a0Alicia Johnson (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), who likes it in England and would really rather not go back to the states. That seems an increasing possibility as the movie goes on and Susan digs herself deeper into a pit of manipulation.\u00a0 Advertisement Stillman pushes the comedy right up to the edge of screwball. He's exceptionally good at this sort of thing and he's at the top of his game here, positioning characters in the frame so that you can see their faces as another person says or does something that's so idiotic they can't believe it, or that is so obviously intended to deceive that they seem to be wondering if this is really happening or if it's a dream.\u00a0 Susan is a great character, easily one of the meatiest parts Beckinsale's been given, and she tears into it. Her life force is so immense that it might remind you of how underused she is elsewhere\u2014how many roles she's played that require little of her besides posing and looking either pretty or formidable. Susan is distinguished by her audacity, not just in her wants and desires but in the way she talks to other people, turning subtext into text in a way most people would not do unless the person they were talking about was in another room, or another state. But they're standing right there! And they can't get their minds around how staggeringly rude and entitled Susan is\u2014most of all Reginald, who's played with great precision by Samuel as a decent man who is so stunned by Susan's nerve that he can barely bring himself to reprimand her: he's too busy marveling at her existence. There's not a lot in the way of story here, though, and you should know that going in. The film is more of a series of situations, which might have been inevitable given that the novel is epistolary and summarizes developments that Stillman had to intuit or flesh out into scenes. After a while Susan becomes wearying, though not as wearying as she'd be if you were in the same house with her. Watching \"Love & Friendship\" is a bit like watching an nonexistent classic sitcom that happens to be based on Jane Austen, one with impeccable timing that dresses its characters in period garb.\u00a0 The direction, writing, photography and performances make it worth seeing, though\u2014in particular Samuel's and Beckinsale's, and Bennett's brilliant turn as Sir James Martin, a grinning ninny who's so hilarious that you can't feel contempt for him, only affection. He's one of those characters who goes on and on, and just when you think you've hit a pause and might have a chance to finally escape, he begins a new thought or a new story and you're stuck with him for another five minutes. Stephen Fry also shows up as Alicia's husband, in a somewhat Oscar Wilde-ean turn that lets him put people in their places, something Fry does better than almost any actor drawing breath. Stillman has a sharp eye and ear for the way people excuse their inexcusable behavior, as well as for the reasons why other people might put up with their nonsense. This film is great fun. It's the sort of movie that fans will quote to each other to affirm membership in a secret club.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Hitman: Agent 47", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "\u201cHitman: Agent 47\u201d is aggressively awful, the kind of film that rubs its lackadaisical screenwriting, dull filmmaking and boring characters in your face, almost daring you to ask the theater operator for your money back. It is a film that feels made out of contractual obligation instead of artistic venture, or even a remote desire to entertain. Other than a few slow-motion action sequences, it does nothing to either distinguish itself from the action movie crowd or even to appeal to fans of the game series on which it is SO loosely based as to really insult its core audience. Here\u2019s where you should know that I\u2019ve played most of the \u201cHitman\u201d games. I\u2019m not convinced anyone involved in the production of \u201cHitman: Agent 47\u201d can say the same. Advertisement The \u201cHitman\u201d games are more about strategy than firepower. You have to work in the shadows, avoiding contact with the enemy, working with limited ammo, and often working with the environment to close your contract. Yes, your character is a killing machine, but most often through stealth and heightened abilities, not because he\u2019s some variation on \u201cThe Terminator.\u201d Before the credits, the video game iteration of Agent 47 has been obliterated, as Rupert Friend\u2019s title character whirls and spins like Neo at the end of \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d eliminating enemies incapable of pointing and shooting their guns in a logical amount of time. In one of the rare nods to the game series, Agent 47 receives his latest assignment from Diana (Angelababy), his mysterious handler. He has to find Katia van Dees (Hannah Ware) and her father Dr. Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds), the man who created the Agent program decades earlier. Since Litvenko disappeared, nefarious bad guys like Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) have been trying to create their own genetically-modified killing machines, and failing. They need Litvenko to resurrect the program that Agent 47 wants to see destroyed forever. And we quickly learn that Katia is no ordinary daughter, as she has a certain set of skills herself. Meanwhile, an American who calls himself John Smith (Zachary Quinto) tracks down Katie himself. Is he a good guy who can protect her or an enemy in disguise? It doesn\u2019t matter. You won\u2019t care. \u201cHitman: Agent 47\u201d is the definition of a soulless film. It is hollow through and through, designed to appeal to an international market with the bare minimum of creative effort put into it to do so. Say what you will about the overall quality of the \u201cResident Evil\u201d films, but they at least had personality now and then, which is what every frame of this film is lacking. Just when you think \u201cAgent 47\u201d might get interesting\u2014mostly in a couple fight scenes with Quinto, who at least seems like he\u2019s the only one having a good time\u2014director Alexsander Bach and writers Skip Woods and Michael Finch go back to the same slo-mo, dull action well again. There\u2019s no character worth caring about, no performance that registers, and no visual style to really note. It\u2019s almost a non-movie.

She can be killed, but she will never die of natural causes or succumb to the usual ravages of time, which gives her relationship with her daughter (played as an older woman by Ellen Burstyn) a fairy tale or horror movie aspect.

Mills Goodloe and Salvador Paskowitz and directed by Lee Toland Krieger, \"Adaline\" starts off handsome but dramatically inert. The third-person storybook narration drifts in and out as needed. The imagery\u2014though shot through with fairy tale special effects and meticulous re-creations of period cityscapes, cars and costumes\u2014feels more literary than cinematic: a slide show illustrating a novel that never was. The casting of the leads doesn't add any spark. Lively is a poised and intriguingly restrained beauty, but the script treats her character as a figurine with no discernible interior life, and the actress does nothing to contradict that impression. She's not bad, not great, just competent, and present. (There are moments where the storybook narration evokes \"Amelie\" and \"A Very Long Engagement,\" which likewise keep their heroines at arm's length, but Lively is no Audrey Tatou.)  Michiel Huisman fares no better as Ellis Jones, the first man to win Adaline's heart in decades. Although he displayed off-kilter charisma in HBO's \"Treme\" and \"Game of Thrones,\" he's asked to play a conventional 2015 male ingenue here: a bland dreamboat with kind eyes, a well-trimmed beard and mustache, and rock-hard abs. Ellis wants them to spend the rest of their lives together, but Adaline (who now goes by Jenny) can't find the nerve to tell him why this can't happen. She's nice, he's nice, they can't be nice together. It's a sad predicament, but there's no tension in it. Then Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker show up as Ellis' parents, William and Kathy Jones, who've been married for forty years. Suddenly \"The Age of Adaline\" locks into just the right tone and rarely steps wrong. William is struck by Jenny's resemblance to his great lost love, Adaline, with whom he had a brief but intense affair in the '60s. Adaline is as rattled by him as he is by her, but she recovers and says Adaline was her mother, and that she died a long time ago. Rather than defuse the situation, the lie sends William into a depressive spiral of drinking, agonized flashbacks, and awkward confessions that set his wife on edge. \"You should see her face when you talk about her,\" she tells him. We have seen his face. It's devastating. Ford's voice\u2014always deep, lowered an octave by age and one more by William's longing\u2014is even more powerful. This is Ford's best performance since \"The Fugitive,\" maybe since \"Witness.\"\u00a0  Advertisement Sigmund Freud's \"Mourning and Melancholia\" might as well be the film's secret other screenplay. Something about the configuration of characters and secrets in the Jones house strikes uncanny notes, plunging the movie into a tender fugue state. Suddenly a stable and mutually nourishing marriage is shaken by a husband's rekindled love affair with a woman who (in theory) no longer exists, and whose absence he'd accepted long ago. This is not a May-September romance. There are too many complications and mysteries and too much elapsed time for things to resolve that way. It's a tragedy of a love that can no longer be.  This twist triggers a flood of simple but big emotions, and \"The Age of Adaline\" wades into it with confidence, laying out all four major characters' predicaments with sympathy and intelligence, and never shying away from the\u00a0 sentimentality at the heart of every scene and line. Lively and Huisman spring to life; instead of writing them off as inoffensive eye candy, you start to appreciate them as actors, and see shadings in their characters that weren't apparent before. Krieger's direction sharpens up as well. The last half-hour of \"The Age of Adaline\" has a symphonic purity of feeling, piecing together simple closeups and elegantly choreographed wide shots so intuitively that the story seems to be telling itself. There are moments that may remind viewers of \"Somewhere in Time,\" another doomed love story whose glaring faults receded once the film started plucking the audience's heartstrings like a virtuoso cellist. (Christopher Reeve! John Barry! That penny!)  The concluding moral diminishes what came before; it makes the film seem like a glorified self-help manifesto about the necessity of commitment when it's really a dream of love lost, found and redefined. Nevertheless: wow. I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened? Maybe the lived-in authority of Ford and Baker served as an emotional tuning fork and helped the second half find its pitch. Or maybe this is another case of a big-budget movie getting so wrapped up in creating pretty images that it failed to notice that its first half wasn't working. No matter: this is powerful film, often in spite of itself. You want it to break your heart, and it does. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Perfect Match", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Charlie (Terrence Jenkins) is a ladies' man, committed to a life of no emotional commitment. In the first two seconds of the film, he picks up a hot babe on the beach, and takes her back to his palatial pad for 1.) a photo shoot (his Instagram feed is well-renowned) and 2.) supposedly hot sex, but it's so discreetly filmed it's hard to tell. Later, he meets up with his group of friends, toting another babe on his arm, a bimbo who can barely put a sentence together (maybe because her dress is so tight). \"The Perfect Match,\" directed by Bille Woodruff, with a script by Gary Hardwick, Dana Verde and Brandon Broussard, tells the story of how this unrepentant man-whore opens his heart to love. Some of it is so predictable you could set your watch by it, but there is a welcome (and surprising) layer of complexity running through the film that makes it a little bit more than your standard fare. The likable and funny ensemble helps too.  Advertisement Charlie is a talent agent with a gift for taking care of his clients, diffusing their melt-downs, and seeing the potential in YouTube/Vine/Snapchat stars. (Brandy shows up in a very entertaining cameo as a diva so committed to her spirituality that for an hour a day her \"feet must not be on the earth,\" so she has hired a bodyguard named Boris to carry her around in his arms.) Charlie's got a great tribe of friends, all of whom get their own story-lines in the film. There's Victor (Robert Christopher Riley) and Ginger (Lauren London), together since they were kids and now planning their wedding. Ginger makes more money than Victor does, and he's having a crisis about it. Pressie (Dascha Polanco, from \"Orange Is the New Black\") and Rick (Donald Faison) are trying to have a baby, and starting to panic that it hasn't happened yet. Charlie's friends hammer away at him relentlessly for his single status. (If Charlie ever fell in love, you wonder what his friends would find to talk about.) Charlie insists he's happy the way he is, that not everybody wants to be married. It's a fair point. His sister Sherry (Paula Patton) is a therapist who bombards him with self-help-speak; she's convinced that unresolved grief at the death of their parents is why Charlie shut the door to his heart. Charlie laughs it all off. He's sick of being badgered, and who can blame him? However, when his pals challenge him to date only one woman in the period leading up to Victor and Ginger's wedding, Charlie agrees. They shake on it, and two seconds later Charlie has a juice-bar meet-cute with Eva (Cassie Ventura).  Eva has only been in long-term relationships, but says she wants to try something fun and no-strings. They have non-explicit, supposedly hot sex not only at his house, but in restaurant bathrooms, and it's all good, until he starts to develop feelings for her, mainly because she shows interest in his photography and listens to him when he complains about his job. He never asks her anything about herself. He doesn't even seem curious. It's hard to tell whether or not this is a deliberate choice on the part of the screenwriters or evidence of a blind spot. It doesn't help that Cassie Ventura, a singer and model mainly, delivers her lines in a wooden monotone, with nothing behind her eyes. She's beautiful, and Eva's outfits are outrageous sex-bomb extravaganzas, fit for a Prince video or a Fashion Week catwalk, but there's no real character there. The story is supposed to be that a hopeless Ladies' Man falls in love almost in spite of himself, and so it might have helped to have given Eva some qualities other than a gorgeous body and an endless wardrobe of crazy outfits.  When things start to go south for Charlie, he basically becomes an alcoholic over the course of a \"long weekend.\" He lies in bed, surrounded by empty bottles. He slumps on the boardwalk, sipping from a flask. It's all a bit ridiculous. His friends are concerned, but he pushes everyone away. He doesn't agree with some of the decisions being made at work. The lovely dead-eyed Eva has helped him see that maybe he can have more from life.  Some of this works, some of it doesn't. There are awkward sequences where the comedy falls flat, and there are some sub-plots that don't really add much. (The office stuff, except for Brandy being carried around by \"Boris,\" is both boring and over-complicated. It's \"Jerry Maguire\"-lite.) Bille Woodruff, a music video director who has helmed a couple of follow-up films in popular franchises, keeps the story zipping along, though, and any time all of the friends are onscreen together, the film is successful because of the very real dynamic they create. It's totally believable that these people have known one another since grade school. You like all of them.  Advertisement As predictable as much of \"The Perfect Match\" is, the way it all plays out has some unconventionality. The fiction/fantasy that dominates so much of our lives is that \"all it takes\" to be happy is to find \"the right person.\" And, supposedly, there's a \"right person\" out there for everyone. Clich\u00e9s abound. \"Once you stop needing a relationship, voila! Your perfect mate will arrive!\" \"You just haven't met the right person yet.\" \"Once you're finally okay with being alone, whaddya know, here comes the Perfect Match!\" Or, even worse, \"The best way to go through life is in a relationship.\" These bromides are so omnipresent they're practically propaganda. But life is messier than that, and some people don't find their \"perfect match,\" and, besides, nothing is perfect, anyway. Charlie has issues, that's for sure, and they're presented in pretty obvious strokes (why won't he go visit his parents' graves?), but at least his issues have more depth than most other films of this nature allow.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Wedding Doll", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The Israeli film \u201cWedding Doll,\u201d written and directed by\r\nNitzan Gilady, has an unusual amount of pictorial beauty, both of the harsh and\r\nsoft varieties. The harshness, or at least starkness, is provided by the Negev\r\nDesert, around which the movie is set. Its golden planes and imposing\r\npromontories are spectacular and a bit intimidating. The soft beauty is provided\r\nby the film\u2019s lead actress, the brightly open-faced Moran Rosenblatt, who plays\r\nHagit, a mentally disabled young woman who has an uncanny talent: she crafts\r\nlovely little dolls using toilet paper and the rolls it comes on as her main\r\nmaterial.  Advertisement Hagit has a job at the small factory that manufactures said\r\nhousehold staple, and the place isn\u2019t doing so well. The owner wants to shut it\r\ndown, but his ambitious son Omri (Roy Assaf) wants to innovate; either way,\r\nshe\u2019ll be out of a job. To forestall this, Hagit has her mom Sara (Assi Levy)\r\ndrive her to a gown shop, where she hopes to work as a seamstress. Her halting\r\nspeech and awkward manner mean she\u2019s going to get the high hat, and she gets a\r\nvariation on that quite a bit, even from a school kid who bounces a soccer ball\r\nat her and calls her \u201cweirdo.\u201d  It\u2019s worse than that: Hagit and her mom are estranged from\r\nother members of the family, including Hagit\u2019s brother, whose infant child was\r\nonce almost accidentally dropped by his sister. Omri is carrying on with Hagit\r\na bit behind everybody\u2019s back, insisting that he keep their relationship secret\r\n(Omri is also less than truthful to his buddies, who make a fine trio of\r\nnarrow-minded small town vitelloni to\r\nbe sure). Hagit is convinced that she\u2019s on the fast track to marriage with Omri\r\nwhether the factory closes or not.  Oy. As much intriguing local detail and sharp\r\ncharacterization writer/director Gilady brings to bear on this concise tale,\r\nthe tale itself depicts the beautiful and often uncomprehending Hagit getting\r\nlet down over and over again. It\u2019s heartbreaking. I understand that the viewer\r\nis meant to be won over, and possibly inspired, by the character\u2019s resilience.\r\nAnd while the movie\u2019s disinclination to give Hagit any kind of break,\r\nfairy-tale or otherwise, speaks well of its commitment to a kind of realism,\r\nthe depiction of provincial bigotry against differently-abled folk is, while\r\nlikely accurate, also just plain depressing. The integrity of the filmmaking\r\nand the luminosity of Rosenblatt\u2019s performance are undeniable. And I suppose\r\nthe fact that I was affected as I was by \u201cWedding Doll\u201d is testimony to its\r\nemotional effectiveness. But while Hagit is able to crack a smile at the\r\nmovie\u2019s end, I feel a pall wrapping around me every time I contemplate her predicament,\r\nor the predicament of her real-life models.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Suffragette", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Movies about political movements tend to have one of two problems:1.) The film views the events through the filter of one individual's experience, narrowing the scope.2.) The film takes a rote, careful approach, sacrificing emotional complexity. \"Suffragette,\" detailing the push for women's suffrage in the United Kingdom in 1911-13, has both of these problems, although it suffers more from the first. Directed by Sarah Gavron and written by Abi Morgan, \"Suffragette\" makes it look like because one (fictional) woman (Carey Mulligan) testified about her hardships to future Secretary of State for War Lloyd George, the suffrage movement experienced a depth-charge of commitment. In reality, the movement was a fractious and divided affair (and, incidentally, far more interesting than one mousy woman deciding to get involved). Advertisement Maud (Mulligan) lives with her husband and son and works in a laundry, a hotbed of deplorable conditions, low wages, and sexual assault. A co-worker named Violet (Anne-Marie Duff) encourages Maud to come to secret meetings run by Edith and Hugh Ellyn (Helena Bonham Carter and Finbar Lynch). Maud gets sucked in. She is arrested and then released, a pattern that will continue, although the incarcerations grow brutal, involving hunger strikes and the barbaric practice of forcible feeding. A cop (Brendan Gleeson) doesn't think much of women's suffrage, and yet is concerned about Maud: he sees working-class women being used as \"fodder,\" taking risks that the upper-class women refuse to take. He is not wrong, nor is he entirely unsympathetic. Gleeson brings a welcome layer to the film.  Shot mostly handheld (the cinematographer is the talented Eduard Grau, whose last film was Joel Edgerton's \"The Gift\"), \"Suffragette\" feels like a documentary in its visuals, but at the same time drowns in subjectivity (Maud's face in repeated closeup). The peripheral (where the good stuff happens) is barely perceived. It's telling that the most moving passage in \"Suffragette\" is newsreel footage of a real event.  \"Suffragette\" includes the events known by anyone familiar with the history: hunger strikes, bombs dropped into mailboxes, the blowing up of Lloyd George's summer home. A turning point was in 1913, when Emily Wilding Davison (played in the film by Natalie Press) stepped out in front of King George's galloping horse on Derby Day, a \"Votes for Women\" banner in her hand, and was trampled to death. A martyr. Thousands of people lined the streets to watch the funeral procession. It's all in \"Suffragette,\" but you keep wanting to move Maud out of the way so you can get a better view.  Meryl Streep appears once as Emmeline Pankhurst, the movement's figurehead. Pankhurst, wanted by the police, comes out of hiding to make a speech from a balcony. In a 1933 article, Rebecca West (suffragette, journalist, and, near the end of her life, one of the \"witnesses\" in Warren Beatty's \"Reds\"), referred to Pankhurst as a \"reed of steel.\" Streep, in the two minutes (tops) she's on-screen, places a genteel overlay of breeding in her ringing hoity-toity voice, but her speech is filmed in such a haphazard way that what it ends up being about is her gigantic hat. Advertisement Bonham Carter, on the other hand, strolls into \"Suffragette\" and steals it from under Mulligan's nose. Edith is a pharmacist in a good marriage, who decides to break the laws that were passed without her consent or vote. She is physically fragile but emotionally indomitable. Mulligan's work seems unfocused and moist, in comparison. For example, in one scene, Lloyd George (Adrian Schiller) informs a gathering of women that the suffrage bill did not pass. The women feel betrayed (they thought he was an ally) and shouts of \"Liar!\" fill the air. Mulligan shouts \"Liar\" and there's nothing going on beneath\u00a0her face. Her expression is flat, it leads nowhere. Meanwhile, next to her, Bonham Carter shimmers with rage and a practical tight-lipped determination. She is dogmatic and fearless, the embodiment of a \"reed of steel.\" Recently, \"Stonewall\" received criticism for showing the Stonewall Riots through the eyes of a fictional white boy, when those riots were instigated by mostly black and Latina protesters, people whose names are already in the history books. \"Suffragette\" has a similar problem. These real people\u00a0are heroes. Let them star in their own stories. Compare to Warren Beatty's \"Reds,\" which had a personal story, featuring the real-life people, and which\u00a0also managed to show the divides in the American Left, the factions and the unpredictable alliances, without sacrificing emotion or\u00a0depth. Or Ava DuVernay's \"Selma,\" with its ideological clashes, fights over the best approach and portraits of the diverse real-life figures involved: students, women, preachers, laymen. Films like \"Reds\" or \"Selma\" have a willingness to tolerate complexity. Complexity is part of the struggle. There are moments in \"Suffragette\" that try (some women back out when bombs are discussed), but the focus on Maud, and her personal situation, diminishes the movement.  As with many movements, groups were excluded initially: working-class women, women of color, single women, and those who deviated from mainstream dogma. \"Suffragette\" ends with a roll of dates showing when various nations gave women the vote. In America, all women were enfranchised in 1920, but state laws and intimidation kept black women out of the voting booth in many areas until decades later. It's a glaring omission, and, again, shows an unwillingness to live in the rich complexity of reality. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "World War Z", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"World War Z\" plays as if someone watched the similar \"28 Days Later\" and thought, \"That was a good movie, but it would be better if it cost $200 million, there were armies of zombies, and the hero were perfect and played by Brad Pitt.\" Which is another way of saying that if you need proof that sometimes more can be less, here you go. Directed by Marc Forster and written by everyone in Hollywood, if rumors are to be believed (though three got credit), this adaptation of Max Brooks' oral history of a zombie apocalypse... Advertisement Hold on. I'm sorry, but before we take this movie apart, let's take a closer look at that last phrase: \"oral history of a zombie apocalypse.\" Those six words tell you everything this film gave up by going in a conventional direction. I've never read Brooks' book and don't have any immediate plans to, but the notion of telling this tale in a roundabout way, by having survivors of the conflagration sit there and talk to an unseen cameraperson\u2014perhaps against a plain black background, with or without cutaways to still photographs or \"news video\"\u2014is electrifying to consider. Such an approach might have yielded the first fresh contribution to the zombie picture\u00a0since \"Rec\". The latter viewed an undead attack through the eye of a home video camera and treated the result as \"found footage\" -- a great post-\"Blair Witch\" embellishment, considering how much of horror's effectiveness lies in what you\u00a0don't see. A faithful transcription of Brooks' source might have taken fright-film minimalism even further. What\u00a0better way to amplify the hideousness of the dead attacking the living than by fixing a camera's unblinking eye on the survivors as they talked about the homes and people and limbs they lost in the struggle? A friend who's heard the audiobook version of \"World War Z\" said it reminded her of old time radio drama: \"Theater of the mind,\" she said. \"World War Z,\" in contrast, is just bloody eye and ear candy.\u00a0I realize it's problematic to review a film on the basis of what it might have been, but when that same film substitutes a vision that's vastly less intriguing and original than the one offered by its source, it's a fair tactic, and what's onscreen here is just another zombie picture, gigantic but otherwise unremarkable. It's not that scary until you get to the end. Ironically, what makes the end work is its embrace of old fashioned zombie film values: intimacy, silence, suggestion, and the strategic deployment of boredom to lull viewers into complacency and set them up for the next big scare. \"World War Z\" is mostly David Lean-on-caffeine panoramas of computer-generated zombies swarming ant-like up walls and over barricades and taking down computer-generated choppers while Forster's close-up camera swings all over the place to generate unearned \"excitement.\" The final setpiece watches three people sneak into a lab that's overrun by a few dozen sleepy and distracted flesh-snackers. It's slow.\u00a0It's quiet. It's scary. It works. Sometimes when you re-invent the wheel, the result doesn't get you very far.\u00a0 Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former United Nations field agent who retired to spend time with his wife Karin (Mirelle Enos) and their charming daughters. He's every other character played by Robert Redford in the 1970s and '80s: noble, brave, calm in a crisis, endlessly resourceful, kind to his spouse and children, respectful of authority but not slavishly so, independent-minded by not arrogant; a snooze. \u00a0Forster and his collaborators deserve credit for plunging us into the thick of things: the Lanes learn that society is collapsing when a seemingly ordinary urban traffic jam is jolted into surreality by an explosion, a stampede of terrified civilians and their vehicles, and a furious attack by people who've been infected by a virus that turns them into ravenous ghouls. (The film's details are fuzzy, but I think they actually are ghouls here, not just rabid and homicidal mortals, as in the \"Days\" pictures.) \u00a0The rest of the picture is a globetrotting medical mystery that just happens to feature zombies, with Lane and various helpers, some military and others scientific, trying to figure out what sparked the disease and counter it before the undead overrun everything. It's \"Contagion\" or \"The Andromeda Strain,\" but with zombies, and without much panache.\u00a0 Advertisement Although Mirielle Enos' talents are wasted -- she anchors a police procedural on television, but this Hollywood movie is content to cast her as a standard-issue Dutiful Wife -- there are some dandy cameos and supporting turns. I like David Morse's one scene as a twitchy, traumatized CIA agent who knows something about the origin of the disease, and James Badge Dale as a U.S. Special Forces captain whose gung-ho competence is no match for the zombie hordes, and\u00a0Daniella Kertesz as Segan, an Israeli soldier whose indefatigable spirit helps the hero save the day even after she's suffered unimaginable trauma.\u00a0 But aside from Segan, none of the characters rise above the level of purely functional placeholder-types, and there are too many scenes that replicate zombie film tropes, minus the passionate invention that other films have brought to the task. When a supporting character is infected and instantly \"turns,\" I was reminded of that masterful sequence in \"28 Days Later\" in which Brendan Gleeson's jovial dad catches a drop of contaminated blood in his eye and battles the virus while his daughter looks on. The poor bastard goes through a whole existential crisis in less than a minute. The sheer terror of losing one's soul has rarely been communicated so economically. Nothing in \"World War Z\" comes anywhere near that scene's power.\u00a0 Forster deserves credit, I guess, for finding a way to make a \u00a0PG-13 zombie movie\u00a0without totally softening it. Horrendous violence occurs off-camera or below the frame line but doesn't lack for impact. There are some shiveringly good moments near the end, particularly when Gerry gets too close to a walker with snicker-snack rat-teeth. But elsewhere, you may feel as though a genre's essence has been betrayed. Forster has made a zombie movie for people who don't like zombie movies. That's not the sort of accomplishment one should brag about. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Christmas, Again", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "One of the most important challenges for a director (along with the cinematographer and editor of any given film) is to create the proper mood for the story. Mood may be more important than words, because words come out of\u2014or are contextualized by\u2014mood. Mood is ephemeral, but it helps establish point of view and orients us in the dream-space of the film. With all of the things that \"Christmas, Again\" (written and directed by Charles Poekel in his feature debut) does well (and it does almost everything well), the most striking thing about it is its evocation of an extremely specific mood. Once we settle into it, and it happens early, everything else becomes possible.  Advertisement The lead character of \"Christmas, Again\" is named Noel (Kentucker Audley)\u2014too cutesy a name to be believed, but it's skipped over like a pebble jumping across a pond. Noel spends most of his year working construction \"upstate\" but every Christmas time, he is one of those guys you see on almost every corner in New York, selling Christmas trees (plus wreaths, stands and lights). It's seasonal work, and post-Christmas, those guys vanish suddenly\u00a0and then re-appear the next year. Poekel himself worked this seasonal job, and the film is great in showing how it all operates. Noel works the night-shift and oversees his two day-shift workers.  And that's pretty much it, in terms of plot. Things do happen: Noel is annoyed at the lackadaisical attitude of his underlings (\"Nick, you gotta be better at sweeping up the needles, man...\"), goes every day to swim and shower at a nearby YMCA, buys Lotto tickets. Noel is quiet, but not apathetic about his job: he is ambitious to sell as many trees as possible. People who recognize him ask if \"Marianna\" is with him, and he replies, \"Not this year\" without elaborating. Maybe she's an ex-girlfriend. It's not clear. Maybe they worked the Christmas season together and he had a crush on her and that's as far as it went. (That somehow seems more likely. He seems like an unrequited kind of guy.) None of these events are highlighted in a way that telegraphs \"Here is the plot.\" \"Christmas, Again\" asks us to submit to the mood because that is where the profundity and emotion exists. New York is narrowed down to one corner, but on that corner a bustling diverse life occurs. Cinematographer Sean Price Williams, who helped shoot Albert Maysles' \"Iris,\" and also shot indie hit \"Listen Up Philip\", often blurs out the background, fuzzed-out colored strings of lights filling up the space behind people's faces. The light is harsh in the morning, and dark blue at night. You can feel how cold it is.  Advertisement Noel has interactions with various customers: an impatient guy with a Bluetooth who takes pictures of various trees to text to his wife (\"Hold the tree straight,\" Bluetooth guy commands), a seemingly flirtatious woman who admires the holly Noel put in the wreaths, a woman who asks \"Do you have the Obama tree from Ohio?\", and an\u00a0intense guy who asks, \"Do women like Douglas fir or Balsam fir better?\" Some of the interactions have more reverb than others, but they remain isolated incidents with their own internal tensions and a strong cumulative effect. One night, a guy comes up behind him and punches him in the head with no warning. Later Noel admits, \"I been punched before\" and you believe it.  Kentucker Audley is a naturally charismatic actor. In \"Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck,\" Courtney Love observes that her husband \"had no idea he was as good-looking as Brad Pitt,\" and you get the sense that Noel is the same way. His handsome face flickers with emotions, gone in a flash. When he does show humor, it is only in his eyes, but it's there, a slight wince accompanying. Audley draws you in in the way the old movie stars used to do: his emotions are clear and mysterious at the same time. Loneliness does not express itself in language. Loneliness is the air Noel breathes. It's in his posture.  There are glimpses of unexplained strangeness: In the trailer, Noel listens to what seems to be a tape of an old-timey melodramatic radio show. He keeps pills (for anxiety? pain? sleep?) in different windows of a cheap Advent calendar, popping one a day. When Lydia (Hannah Gross), a drunk girl he helps one freezing night after finding her passed out on a bench in the park, with only one shoe, and gum tangled in her hair, shows up the next day with a pumpkin pie she baked to thank him, he's not sure how to react.\u00a0A more conventional film would have had Lydia be the quirky girl who helps Noel find joy in the Christmas season. \"Christmas, Again\" resists. Lydia moves out of the film. She returns, and leaves again. The two try to play cards. She tries to talk to him. He is kind but remote. Silence dominates but it's full, not empty.  Advertisement All of this may sound rather dull. But it's not. It's a beautifully observed film without any overt message (thank goodness) but drenched in melancholy and silence and cold. Things sometimes resolve themselves, gently, only it's fragmentary, and\u00a0none\u00a0of it is \"the point.\" The point is that Noel is a guy living a specific life in a specific season, dealing with emotions that are all over his face but never verbalized. There is no self-pity, no maudlin catharsis. The film has the courage of its convictions and confidence in its mood. What a pleasure to watch a film that resists being about only one thing. That resists the conventional story. That lets us enter into the life of another.  \"Christmas, Again\" is also available on Fandor today.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Men & Chicken", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "David Dencik and Mads Mikkelsen play estranged brothers Gabriel and Elias, respectively, in writer/director Anders Thomas Jensen's bizarre \"Men & Chicken.\" The two men are thrown together when, after their father's death, some family secrets come to light. The comedy in \"Men & Chicken\" sometimes tips into Keystone Cops territory, with people running around in the background like chickens (of course) with their heads cut off. \"Men & Chicken\" is a bizarre family psychodrama as well as a mad-scientist movie, complete with a crazy spooky lab full of terrifying objects. How seriously should any of it be taken? It's hard to tell, but the film has a dry eccentricity that is entertaining and absurd. You don't know what will happen next.

In 1921, the lamest year in physics.\") Elias is first seen on a date with a woman in a wheelchair who makes the fatal error of accidentally interrupting him. He snaps, \"Do all people in wheelchairs interrupt this much?\" Not surprisingly, Elias has no luck with women, particularly unfortunate for him since his sex drive is so titanic that he needs to masturbate multiple times a day. Elias' \"condition\" is treated matter-of-factly by his brother (who pulls over to the side of the road to let Elias get out and do his thing behind a tree). Gabriel is a philosophy professor who dry-retches and gags every other minute for unknown reasons. Elias and Gabriel track down their three half-brothers holed up in a dilapidated former sanitarium, overrun by chickens, ducks, goats. The brothers call to mind the locals in \"Deliverance\": They are barely civilized, beating one another (and Gabriel when he first approaches) with huge dead birds or slabs of wood. They threaten each other with \"the cage\" for rule infractions. It's a madhouse. They all have cleft palates and other physical abnormalities and live in a raw state of nature (putting the lie to Rousseau's theories). They are petty, vicious, savage, rule-bound. Interrupting one another is strictly forbidden.\u00a0 The sanitarium is an incredible and inherently cinematic location, utilized beautifully by Jensen. There are echoing long hallways, mysterious upstairs rooms and an off-limits basement. There is no electricity. The brothers play badminton in one room, all wearing tennis whites, and they treat the game as seriously as a World Cup match. At any time, a fist fight could break out. Every night they curl up by the fire and have a bedtime story hour, where they discuss plot points and character analysis, and nobody is allowed to interrupt anyone else, and of course nobody can obey that rule perfectly. The family unit is a tinderbox. The ensemble acting is terrific.\u00a0 Advertisement Gabriel, determined to find answers about their shared background, tries to wrestle the wild brothers under control. Elias, however, takes to the chaos like a duck to water.\u00a0Within 24 hours, he's dressed up in tennis whites playing badminton as though he had lived there all his life. He never wants to leave.\u00a0 Mads Mikkelsen, an exquisite actor, so elegant, controlled and frightening as Hannibal on NBC's \"Hannibal,\" is barely recognizable as the constant-masturbator Elias. He's got a haircut and a mustache reminiscent of Christopher Walken's sleazy look in \"At Close Range.\" But it's not just the externals that make him unrecognizable. Elias is chatty, impulsive, rude, irritated by his frustrated sex drive. Mikkelsen, as Elias, is always thinking, processing, eyes shifting around as he takes in new information. He thinks\u00a0so much more than he says, and that's one of the reasons that the performance is so funny. It's not strange just for the sake of being \"wacky\" or \"quirky.\" Mikkelsen has made sense of Elias, and has connected all of those disparate pieces to create a very real character. Humphrey Bogart once said that good acting was six feet back in the eyes. Mikkelsen goes that deep, and that's why he is so transformed. Elias is so strange that one might struggle to place him, or compare him to someone else. But he is his own thing, and you can't take your eyes off of him.\u00a0 Strange motifs and themes emerge and recur: copious ejaculation, dead birds, evolutionary mutations, hybrid breeds, survival of the fittest, inherited characteristics. Nature creates \"monsters,\" and man can create monsters of his own. Jensen uses horror movie tropes: strange things glimpsed at night, closed doors, phonographs playing in empty rooms. But there are farcical elements too: the brothers running around the sanitarium wielding badminton rackets, the repeated beatings with a stiff dead bird and the casual discussions afterwards (\"I'm not mad at you for beating Gabriel with the mute swan. It happens to the best of us.\") There's also a grotesque element, in the traditional sense of the word: \"freaks,\" cages, mutations limping through their lives. What was their father up to? What's with the cleft palates? What is in that basement? At some point, is someone going to sexually assault a chicken? It is discussed as a valid option.\u00a0 Audience members looking for a character to \"relate to\" or \"like\" may have a rough time. But nobody is likable in farce or absurdist black comedy: it's not that kind of genre, nor should it be. What does all of this add up to? Damned if I know. But it's fun to see a film that plays by its own rules to such a degree that any comparison to anything else falls apart.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Human Capital", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Set in a town in Brianza and in Milan, mostly on the night before the night before Christmas, \"Human Capital\" is the kind of movie that embeds the significance of its title into every subplot, then defines it in an onscreen title at the end, just to make sure you got it. Essentially \"American Beauty, Italian Style,\" with a similar \"Ah, sweet magical mystery of life!\" score and an artfully scrambled timeline, this ensemble drama about troubled upper-middle class strivers\r\n is slick, confident, and rather empty, and structurally more self-defeating than clever.  Advertisement The script slides back and forth along a timeline, always returning to the script's central gathering place, a private school student awards ceremony/dinner after which a waiter is hit by a car while bicycling home. This is supposed serve as a Macguffin, stoking a sense of mystery and anticipation: Which person (or persons) hit the waiter? Why didn't they cop to it? How to they plan to escape punishment?  But as the movie unreels\u2014leaping from one character and subplot to another, as one might explore different Wikipedia biographies by clicking on hypertext-linked names\u2014the movie runs out of gas, and your attention wanders instead to the individual characters, their world, and the themes that writer-director Paolo Virzi (\"Napoleon in the City,\" \"Every Blessed Day\") tries too strenuously to explore: the oblivious arrogance of the One Percenters; the way\u00a0 greed tends to drown out decency; modern capitalism's tendency to treat everything, including people, as raw material to be bought, consumed, or discarded.\u00a0 The ensemble cast is strong, though; their performances and \r\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Alm\u00e9ras's cinematography ensure that \"Human Capital\" remains watchable even after you feel you've gotten the point already and the movie is belaboring it. Fabrizio Bentivoglio brings a Jack Lemmon-like wheedling desperation to the role of Dino Ossola, a local real estate success story who borrows seven hundred thousand Euros to buy into a supposedly high-yield hedge fund. The fund is overseen by Giovanni Bernaschi (Fabrizio Grifuni), a filthy rich investor who lives in a mansion with a marble driveway. He's connected to Dino through his teenage son Massimiliano (Guglielmo Pinelli), who attends the aforementioned private school with Dino's lovely, kindhearted daughter, Serena (Matilde Gioli).  Giovanni is a classic money-grubbing cinematic yuppie. He's always seen in an expensive suit and tie or in silk robes that probably cost more than some people's cars; why they didn't just give him a top hat and monocle is beyond me. His wife Carla (Valeria Bruna Tedeschi) is a onetime actress morally numbed by abandoning her art and spending her days spending her husband's money. When she convinces Giovanni to buy and rescue a doomed local theater for her to restore, it rekindles her sense of possibilities, and sparks a powerful attraction between her and one of the theater's trustees, the idealistic college professor Luigi Lo Cascio (Donato Russomanno).  Advertisement There are more characters where these came from. They're connected by the central question of who hit the cyclist, as well as by the (often tangentially) related themes of greed, poor impulse control, and guilt (or the lack thereof). Nearly every major character is harboring a devastating secret which, if exposed, could ruin them or bring shame to their families.  This sounds like a tasty recipe for a domestic melodrama, but Virzi avoids any filmmaking that might suggest overwhelming passion or messiness. The movie is as neat and tidy as can be, every character slotted into a particular section, every repeated scene marked on an unseen master timeline, every lesson reflecting every other lesson. The photography is elegant and tasteful, especially during long confrontations between two characters that are shot in unbroken, claustrophobic takes; but maybe elegant and tasteful were the wrong values to embrace? This material about repressed rich and near-rich people cries out for some visual or rhythmic instability\u2014a sense that the normal patterns (of storytelling as well as life) have been disrupted, destroyed, rewritten. What's onscreen feels rote, clean, safe. All the puzzle pieces drop into place one-by-one, because the filmmaker knows what the finished picture will be.  The performances are superb, with the conspicuous exception of Pinelli, whose overwrought acting plays like a tone-deaf parody of wealthy teenage entitlement. Tedeschi's Carla is the film's most affecting character, a once-passionate woman tamed by comfort and only now reawakening, at long last. If the entire film had been about her, I wouldn't have minded; it would've at least given us more time with Tedeschi, an actress whose transparency of feeling bonds us to her. Instead, the picture feels like what a critic friend calls a \"tax shelter movie\": hire a lot of name actors of different generations, put them in a modestly budgeted ensemble movie with interlinked subplots so that everyone gets a \"big\" moment or two, tie it all together with a Big Idea, and voila: commercial art. That's \"Human Capital,\" a film whose title resonates in all the wrong ways.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Tom of Finland", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "How to describe the art of Touko Valio Laaksonen, aka Tom of Finland? Shall I compare thee to a Village People wet dream? No, that\u2019s not quite it. His depictions of gay masculinity, to my eye, are kind of a gender inversion of the iconography of, say, a female bombshell like Jayne Mansfield. The men who sprang from the imagination of Tom of Finland are perfectly chiseled, bubble-butted, well-endowed boys who can\u2019t help it. Their emotional range runs the gamut from friendly (there are some big smiles) to intimidating (there are more impassive-to-frownlike expressions, often camouflaged by thick mustaches). Heterosexual males had their Vargas pinups and other varieties of cheesecake. Tom of Finland drew their gay equivalents, but in a way that tended more toward the surreal/irrational, at least to my eye. A part of the effect had to do with the fact that so much of his artwork was done in black-and-white, pencil drawings of such exquisite and varied shading that one could marvel at the peculiar, painstaking craft as much as one might drool over the impossible physiques. Advertisement Laaksonen lived from 1920 until 1991, and while he moved comfortably and, if this film is to be believed, delightedly in international gay circles, he was not known as a personality in the mainstream culture. This fiction film, directed by Dome Karukoski and written by Aleksi Bardy (in collaboration with, apparently, five other scenarists/contributors), is a heartfelt tribute to the artist. It\u2019s also a too-often diffuse one.    The movie opens with Pekka Strang, who plays the title character, in rather unconvincing old-age makeup sitting in what looks like a railway station waiting room, having a conversation in English. The framing device is a celebration he is given in America\u2014which was a country where his work could be more openly celebrated than his native land, where homosexuality was a crime until 1971, and its \u201cpromotion\u201d was a crime until 1999, several years after Laaksonen\u2019s death. The movie flashes back to World War II, in which Laaksonen was a soldier; a defining event of his time in the army, the movie tells us, was when he stabbed to death a Russian parachutist. Shorter shrift is given to the Nazis, of whom the real-life Laaksonen once observed, \u201cthey have the best uniforms.\u201d A different film might have made dramatic hay out of an examination of Laaksonen\u2019s abhorrence of what the Nazis\u2019 stood for versus his admiration for a certain strain of fascist fashion/style, but this is not a movie with a lot on its mind.    Rather, it\u2019s all about personal struggle. \u201cTom\u201d hides his drawings from his sister, who disapproves of his preferences, referring to them as a \u201cphase.\u201d There\u2019s a bit of drama when a roomer arrives, and a possible romance between him and the sister turns into a lifelong love story for \u201cTom.\u201d There is not a lot concerning the job Laaksonen had at the Finnish office of McCann Erickson, the advertising giant. The most interesting stuff in the movie is about the artwork\u2014not how Laaksonen made it, the movie is hardly concerned with craft, but rather its initial uses. How Laaksonen first used his postcard size-drawings as invitation cards of a sort, requests to men he found attractive as to whether they were interested in that sort of thing. In a society that makes homosexuality illegal, gays are obliged to speak in code, and that\u00a0the drawings served as an extension of code\u2014as a crossing of little or no return in certain respects\u2014is fascinating.\u00a0 When \u201cTom\u201d starts selling his drawings in America and begins to travel there, the movie takes on an almost magical-realist tone. In the \u201850s and \u201860s \u201cTom\u201d has to live in shadows, and a trip to Berlin during which authorities discover one of his drawings is a near-catastrophe for him. In Beverly Hills, when a group of cops walks in on a pool party his hosts have arranged for him, Laaksonen fears the worst, but the scene ends with an amusingly ironic twist. Unfortunately, little else in the movie carries that kind of impact. Its lively finale is heartening, given the patience that Laaksonen was obliged to exercise before he could live his life out in the open. But the insights of the movie are too scant for much of a real impression to take hold of the viewer. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Against The Sun", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Arriving on the heels of Angelina Jolie's \"Unbroken,\" which also featured a sequence involving a life raft adrift in the Pacific ocean during WWII, The American Film Company's \"Against the Sun\" tells the true story of an air crew who had to take to the life raft after their plane went down in the Pacific. The three man-crew was presumed missing at sea, after a cursory \"box search\" was done for them. It was January, 1942. \"Against the Sun\" is a respectfully told survivalist story of pilot Harold Dixon (Garret Dillahunt), bombardier Tony Pastula (Tom Felton), and radioman Gene Aldrich (Jake Abel) in a life raft with no food, no flares, no water, no supplies, all of it had gone down with the plane. Advertisement There's a universal appeal to such stories, perhaps because they enact a horrified sense of empathy and worry: What would I do in such a situation? How would I fare? Stories as varied as \"Touching the Void,\" \"All is Lost,\" \"Lifeboat,\" books like Alfred Lansing's Endurance, Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air, or Piers Paul Read's Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors, examine the lengths human beings will go to to survive, the problem-solving stamina required, and how often it is the will to make it out of the situation that makes the difference. \"Against the Sun\" takes place almost entirely in the life raft, with a short prologue showing the crew's final moments in the plane when they realize they have somehow flown off-course and don't have enough fuel to get back to the aircraft carrier. The film features three strong no-frills performances from actors who are quite literally on top of each other for the duration. Director Brian Falk, who co-wrote the script with Mark David Keegan, worked well with cinematographer Petr Cikhart to keep the story visually interesting, despite the limitations placed on the tale by the monotonous setting. Sometimes the camera is in the raft, the men's limbs pig-piling on top of one another, and sometimes the camera pulls back to long shots, the raft appearing tiny and fragile in that vast heaving ocean. There are a couple of effective overhead shots showing the sharks circling beneath the raft, or the men tearing into a raw fish with their bare hands, shoveling meat into their mouths. The best parts of such stories are when the characters have to troubleshoot terrible situations. How will they make fish hooks? How will they gather water? What about sunburn? How will they know in which direction they are drifting, and how far? In Laura Hillenbrand's book Unbroken, she describes how Louis Zamperini and the other men in the raft would talk to one another about food back home, going into intense detail about recipes, and preparation. It was not just a way to stave off hunger, but to keep their minds sharp. The men on the raft in \"Against the Sun\" do that, too, pantomiming pouring one another hot cups of coffee, and discussing the foods they can't wait to eat again back home. Advertisement The script in \"Against the Sun\" is slightly over-written, with characters exclaiming things like, \"Maybe if I could get one of these magazines open we could use the springs as a hook!\" The real power of \"All is Lost\" lay in the fact that the character was alone. He had to troubleshoot by himself in a tense silence. It was all action and thought. There are nice touches, though, small unexpected details like the three men introducing themselves to one another once they clambered into the life raft after the crash. They shake hands as though they are at a dinner party. There's another nice scene when Aldrich suggests they pray together. The other two aren't sure, one isn't the praying type, the other only knows prayers in Polish. But they do pray, Pastula finishing it up with, \"Dear God, I'll go along with what the other guys said, but mostly we need some rain, dear Lord.\" There's a realistic feel to moments like that, a practical and humorous edge. There are a couple of hallucinatory sequences that don't quite work, and the score by Paul Mills comes swooping in, insistent upon being inspirational in a way that feels like unnecessary underlining. One doesn't need the score to be inspired by these guys' gritty will to survive.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Chi-Raq", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Chi-Raq\" is a modern-day musical satire about violence and guns and men and women and sex and power. Its title is a slang term coined by residents of Chicago's violence-plagued South side, empowered by statistics showing that more Americans have died from gunshots in the last twelve years than soldiers involved in the American occupation of Iraq. The movie is angry and horrified and mournful but also warm, sensual, life affirming, and so blisteringly funny that critics and political commentators are sure to blast it as distasteful.  Advertisement No matter: \"Chi-Raq\" clearly does not give one-fiftieth of a damn what anyone thinks of its methods; it knows what it is and what it wants to do and commits to its singular vision from start to finish. It's a \r\nmovie that only Lee could have directed with such imagination, high and \r\nlow wit, and sorrow. It is the director's first straight-up, unabashed musical\r\n since \"School Daze,\" his best work in at least ten years, and a culmination of tendencies we've seen percolating in his work since his 1986 debut feature \"She's Gotta Have It.\"  The film is co-written by Lee and independent filmmaker and University of Kansas film professor Kevin Willmott (\"CSA: Confederate States of America\"). It has a plot drawn from Aristophanes' ancient Greek comedy \"Lysistrata\" and dialogue written mostly in rhyming couplets (\"In the style of his time/Aristophanes made that shit rhyme!\") It features spectacular, gliding widescreen camerawork by Matthew Libatique, nearly nonstop musical numbers, eruptions of bawdy sex and appalling violence, and a narrator played by a fedora'd Samuel L. Jackson who stalks through the film in an array of dazzling suits, playing essentially the same role that he played in \"Do the Right Thing\" by way of the stage manager in Thornton Wilder's play \"Our Town.\" Its loopy magnificence makes every other current American film in wide release seem comparatively timid. And that's the triple truth, Ruth.  Rapper-actor Nick Cannon stars as Demetrius Dupree, leader of a purple-clad gang called the Spartans that have warred for years against the orange-clad Trojans, led by the fearsome but humor-impaired Cyclops (Wesley Snipes, who of course wears an eyepatch). The film begins with Cannon's uninterrupted, four-minute performance of the film's title track, which plays out as audio-only: no actors, no dancers, no scenery, just a black screen with lyrics superimposed in bold lettering, maybe the most audacious use of onscreen text in a major motion picture since Jean-Luc Godard's heyday.  Advertisement Then we see a horrifying close-quarters shootout during a live rap show where Demetrius taunts Cyclops. Soon after, an 11-year old girl (the daughter of a character played by Jennifer Hudson) is killed during a shooting incident, and Demetrius and his girlfriend Lysistrata (Teyonah Parris)  are temporarily made homeless by an arson fire that was meant to drive them out of their apartment so that the Cyclops could kill his most hated foe. Something is about to change. Something has to change. The people of Chi-Raq have grown existentially blas\u00e9 about the violence because they think there's no way to stop it; but this latest round is just too much for them. As Jackson's neighborhood DJ, Mister Senor Love Daddy, asked in \"Do the Right Thing\"\u2014in mirrored phrases that anticipate this film's ostentatiously poetic language\u2014\"Are we gonna live together? Together, are we gonna live?\" Lysistrata moves in with her neighbor across the street, a nonviolence advocate known only as Miss Helen (Angela Bassett, who has the eyes and voice of a Greek oracle). Under the older woman's tutelage, Lysistrata hatches a plan to stop the violence: she will urge every woman who's involved with gang members to deny her man access to sex, and only restore \"privileges\" when the gangs sign a peace treaty and agree to put their guns down. \"The red wine has been drunk/The plan has been strunk!\" the narrator \r\nexclaims, in a delightful bit of Dr. Seussian rhyme-mangling.  The movement spreads beyond Chicago and then beyond U.S. borders, encompassing prostitutes and phone sex operators as well as the sex partners of criminals, politicians, lawyers, cops and, seemingly, every man alive (there are even lines suggesting that some gay men are going on strike, too), and sparking a worldwide feud between the sexes. The increasingly militarized police forces of major cities, and the military proper, are deprived of carnal pleasure until they agree to embrace peace. Lysistrata and her women occupy the National Guard Armory by seducing the staff (including David Patrick Kelly's Confederate apologist, General King Kong (a nod to \"Dr. Strangelove\") and move the local chapter of a fez-wearing, African-American fraternal organization (led by the great Steve Harris of \"The Practice\") to lead a counter-protest and plan an insurgency to end what they believe to be an unconscionable dry spell. \"These hos have literally shut down the penis power grid!\" he almost-whines.\u00a0  Advertisement John Cusack shows up as a white priest in a black church (he later explains that he grew up in the neighborhood) who delivers a long, blistering sermon on violence and guns, state indifference and community paralysis, until his voice goes hoarse. It's another kind of musical number, one powered by the musicality of Biblical language and evangelical locutions, the words dipping and rolling and twisting and jumping, the speaker's volume rising and rising and rising, the congregation murmuring and muttering and shouting: Amen! Amen!\u00a0  Lee's 2000 satire of television and racism, \"Bamboozled\"\u2014which has been recently reclaimed as a lost masterpiece, but that I never particularly liked\u2014started with a dictionary definition of the word \"satire,\" which is the surest possible way to signal that a movie has no real control over its tone. \"Chi-Raq\" requires no such audience hand-holding. It is eerily sure of itself, a true satire, at once serious and irreverent, ridiculous and sublime. And like most of Lee's best work (\"Do the Right Thing\" especially; the more I think about this new movie, the more it feels like a companion, even a mirror, to Lee's 1989 masterpiece) it doesn't cook the viewer's interest into paste by sticking to one emotional temperature for too long.  Many stretches of \"Chi-Raq\" are purely musical or purely comedic. But others are explicitly polemical, as when Miss Helen shames Lysistrata for her supplication to Demetrius and gives her brief history of gangs and guns in Chicago, or when Jackson's narrator drops knowledge about the history of violence in the United States and the country's institutionalized legacy of oppression and genocide. Still other scenes are beautiful for beauty's sake, as when Libatique's camera watches an elevated train pull into a station at night. And throughout, there are moments when Lee's direction makes the images themselves seem to dance along with the dancers: watch for the moment in an armory dance number when the image bisects into two very wide, skinny, lateral split-screens, and the motion of a female dancer dipping down low in her frame seems to \"push\" the frame beneath her off'-screen.\u00a0 Advertisement Every Lee film has an affinity for the theatrical. Characters \r\nsometimes stand at center stage (center screen in a film) and talk right\r\n to the audience, often in a tight closeup, or chatter among themselves \r\nto create a communal buzz that can feel like what 1960s activists might \r\nhave called a \"rap session\" (\"rapping\" as in talking; see the \r\nguys on the \r\nstreet corner in \"Do the Right Thing,\" or the women debating the \r\npolitics of skin color in \"Jungle Fever\"). Sometimes\u2014as in the birthday \r\npresent to Nola in \"She's Gotta Have It,\" much of \"School \r\nDaze,\" the opening credits of \"Do the Right Thing,\" the Harlem sequences\r\n of \"Malcolm X,\" and the dance floor number in \"Summer of \r\nSam\"\u2014Lee's \r\ncharacters burst into dance, or song, or both. Lee has often said that he wanted to make another full-on musical after \r\n\"School Daze\" but never got around to it, although he kept circling \r\nversions of \"Rent\" and \"West Side Story\" without landing on them. \r\nThere is a sense in which Lee has always been a theatrical director, as \r\nwell as a rhetorician or commentator and a stand-up comic, even as he \r\nproved himself a master of images who directs in a way that's equally \r\nintuitive and intellectual (not unlike a jazz musician who sticks to the\r\n sheet music sometimes, but improvises other times). All these \r\ncomplementary and conflicting aspects of Lee come together in \"Chi-Raq,\"\r\n a movie that's held together by force of conviction.  Is the movie self-conscious, busy, perhaps all over the place? Absolutely. But this is what a Spike Lee film is, and does. And here, at least, it all seems to be of-a-piece, because the whole thing has been conceived by Lee and Willmott as a spectacularly cinematic equivalent of a stage play: a bit of literal street theater (with reference to gang and drug war and police brutality incidents dating back to the eighties) that aims to provoke and astonish, surprise and shock.  The movie does all of these things and more. There are scenes that are gut-bustingly funny, other scenes that are intensely sexy (especially the final musical number, a \"duet\" of sorts between Cannon and Parris). And from time to time the movie seems to calm down and clear its head so that it can concentrate on a single character at a single moment, often one of great distress. I will never forget the sight of Hudson's grieving mother on her knees in the street, trying to scrub her daughter's blood from the pavement with a sponge.  The movie offers no answers to the problems it presents\u2014rampant street crime in poor neighborhoods; a gun-worshiping American culture tied to capitalist rapaciousness that's hooked into the country's culture of Permanent War; the lure of machismo, which makes violent confrontation seem \"sexier\" than negotiation and de-escalation. But it is not a film's job to offer answers. The job of a movie like this one is to stimulate arguments and hook itself into the viewer's imagination, and \"Chi-Raq\" accomplishes that job brilliantly. Its timing could not be worse, or more perfect. It is the movie we need right now, whether we're willing to admit it or not. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Hector and the Search for Happiness", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Peter Chelsom's \"Hector and the Search for Happiness\" (based on the book\r\n by Fran\u00e7ois Lelord, a psychiatrist in real-life, just like the \r\neponymous Hector) treats happiness as an easily-digestible \r\ncross-stitched homily, the kind hung as harmless decorations in people's\r\n living rooms. It's chain-mail wisdom, sprinkled with balloons and \r\nkitty-cat faces, forwarded by people with too much time on their hands. \r\nIt's \"Eat, Pray, Love\"-lite, and \"Eat, Pray, Love\" was already \"lite.\" \r\nOne of the things \"Eat, Pray, Love\" and \"Hector\" have in common is that \r\nthey feature economically privileged people with enough disposable \r\nincome that they can leave their jobs for an indeterminate period of \r\ntime and take multiple international flights on their quest to \r\nunderstand themselves. Advertisement \r\nHector (Simon Pegg) is a psychiatrist. His patients bore him, and he has\r\n a hard time empathizing with them anymore (if he ever did). He has a \r\ngirlfriend named Clara (Rosamund Pike), who works for a pharmaceutical \r\ncompany, and is congratulated by her boss at a company meeting for \r\n\"never having heard of the two following words-'maternity' and \r\n'leave.'\" Hector and Clara have a tidy high-end life, make each other \r\nlaugh, seem to complement one another, and yet still, Hector is lost. He\r\n packs a backpack and flies to China. Why China, we don't know. \r\nDuring Hector's worldwide search for happiness, he scribbles down \r\nrealizations in his journal, numbering them neatly and accompanying each\r\n one with drawings. The drawings sometimes become animated, showing \r\nHector's growing sense that the world is alive with beauty and mystery. \r\nHector's realizations, though, would be self-evident to any child who \r\nhas seen a Disney movie, not to mention the fact that these realizations\r\n have already been expressed, and far better, by some of the greatest \r\nwriters and thinkers in history. Hector may want to save the money spent\r\n on international airfare and just stay home and read Shakespeare's \r\nplays, or George Eliot's novels or Carl Dennis's poetry. Hector, as \r\nplayed by the very talented Simon Pegg, is a man so shallow he has never\r\n asked himself any personal questions involving any depth whatsoever. \r\nThat's quite a feat for a man pushing 40. \"Hector and the Search for \r\nHappiness\" is extremely forgiving of its lead character, treating his \r\nquest romantically. There are a couple of moments when other characters \r\npoint out Hector's faults (one fight scene with his ex-girlfriend, \r\nplayed by Toni Colette, puts it extremely plainly), but those moments \r\nend up calling into question the point of the entire film. While \r\nunderstanding that \"Hector and the Search for Happiness\" is meant to be a\r\n parable, and not realistic, it uses the most condescending \r\nfortune-cookie thinking possible, not to mention calling in entire \r\nforeign nations to act as props to highlight one man's quest for \r\nenlightenment. \r\nOn his flight to China, Hector meets Edward, a wealthy businessman \r\n(Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), who ends up showing Hector around Shanghai. There \r\nare montages of the two of them wandering the streets, eating \"weird\" \r\nfood and pointing at the sights; Hector agog at the \"exotic\" setting. At a \r\nnightclub, he meets a sexy woman named Ying Li (Ming Zhao).

Bedding sexy natives is one of the \r\nperks of international travel. She is the only person he meets in China,\r\n and she is an amalgamation of unimaginative stereotypes. She is sexy, \r\nand also sweet, and kind of a damsel in distress, too, and she's also \r\nreally just a good girl inside! It doesn't help that some of her moments\r\n are accompanied by the sound of a Chinese gong. Advertisement \r\nHector meets smiling Tibetan monks who have faced terrible persecution \r\nand torture, and yet still, they laugh, circling rapturously underneath \r\nfluttering colored prayer flags, all as Hector watches in amazement, \r\ninspired. That is why Tibet is there, apparently: to inspire the rest of\r\n us. \r\nAfrica is a continent, not a country, and yet \"Hector and the Search for\r\n Happiness\" treats the entire gigantic land-mass, made up of multiple \r\nand diverse countries, as one place: Africa(\u2122). The airplanes in Africa\r\n are filled with breastfeeding women wearing colorful robes, men smoking\r\n cigars, and chickens wandering the aisles. The plane nearly crashes and\r\n everyone laughs uproariously. Hector is inspired by their careless joie\r\n de vivre! He meets a woman on the plane who tells him the secret to \r\nhappiness is in her recipe for sweet potato stew and she invites him \r\nover for dinner. The entire village in the unnamed African country turns\r\n out to greet Hector joyously, whooping it up supportively as he drinks \r\nwine and dances with them. These people have nothing better to do with \r\ntheir lives than try to teach some dumb white guy that it's fun to have a\r\n dinner party and hang out with your friends. The African sequence is a \r\nparticular low-point. Africa is shown as dangerous, gunfire in the \r\nstreets, and the entire \"country\" is boiled down into a place containing\r\n elephants, antelopes, saintly white aid workers, women with baskets on \r\ntheir heads, happy villagers and scary rifle-carrying soldiers. \r\nAs beautifully filmed as the worldwide tour often is (the film was shot \r\nby Kolja Brandt), \"Hector and the Search for Happiness\" has an \r\nundeniable strain of poverty tourism, mixed with the insulting belief \r\nthat those who have nothing somehow hold the secret to life. \"Hector and the Search for Happiness\" ends up, \r\nunintentionally, being a treatise on the cluelessness of affluent \r\ndo-gooders, those who look at a smiling poverty-struck woman in a \r\nrefugee camp and see her as evidence that the world is good because she \r\nis still able to smile! Sure, money isn't \r\neverything, but it certainly isn't nothing either. \r\nHector couldn't trek around for months on end without it. \r\nThe supporting cast features such heavy-hitters as Jean Reno, as a \r\nColombian drug dealer Hector meets in Africa, and Christopher Plummer as\r\n a brilliant and eccentric (he wears a pink sweatshirt during lectures) \r\nneuro-scientist devoted to studying happiness. Toni Collette's character \r\nAgnes seems openly irritated with Hector's quest, and by that point in \r\nthe film, many audience members will feel the same way. Hector is a \r\ncipher, a nonentity, a man with no inner life, until \u2026 smiling Tibetan \r\nmonks show him their prayer flags and something clicks for him. Pegg, a \r\ndiverse and sensitive actor, is fine, but here he's in the service of \r\nextremely poor material. Advertisement \r\nGood intentions are all over \"Hector and the Search for Happiness.\" \r\nClear care has been put into the project. There is nothing wrong with \r\ntrying to put on film a parable about what it means to be human; stories\r\n about unhappy trapped characters who discover a way to cherish the life\r\n that they have. Films like \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \r\n\"Stranger Than Fiction,\" to name just a few, treat this same topic with\r\n sensitivity, creativity, and emotional honesty. \"Hector\" is an animated\r\n Power Point presentation in comparison.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Love, Simon", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Love, Simon\" is a mainstream-styled teenage rom-com that uses\u00a0every cliche in the book. There's the nerdy Vice Principal, the bacchanalian high school party, supportive yet somewhat clueless parents, witty voiceover from the protagonist, public declarations of love in front of the whole school, all held together by a stream of catchy pop tunes. But \"Love, Simon\"'s use of these cliches represents a huge first, because it is the story of a young closeted gay kid's difficult and often humorous march towards coming out. Director Greg Berlanti, who has helmed a string of hit television shows as producer and writer, uses the familiar teenage romance genre to tell an LGBTQ story, and in so doing makes these tropes feel fresh, fun, entertaining. Based on Becky Albertalli's YA novel\u00a0Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, \"Love, Simon\" is a radically inclusive act. Advertisement As Simon (Nick Robinson) tells us in his opening voiceover, he lives a normal life \"just like you.\" He lives in a nice house, has two supportive parents (Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel) and a young sister obsessed with \"Top Chef\" (Talitha Eliana Bateman). He's a good student and participates in the Drama Club. His best friends are Leah (Katherine Langford), Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) and Abby (Alexandra Shipp). Nothing is wrong, except, as Simon says in voiceover, \"I have a huge-ass secret.\" His secret is he is gay. He is pretty sure his parents would be fine with it and his friends would be okay too. He is afraid, instead, of how it will change everything, how people might perceive him differently. He also resents having to \"come out\" at all (which leads to a very funny sequence imagining kids having to come out as heterosexual to their devastated sobbing parents). Why is \"straight the default,\" he asks. When someone with the alias \"Blue\" writes a post on a popular local message board about being afraid to come out as gay, Simon reaches out privately, using the alias \"Jacques.\" The two kids start a correspondence, hesitant at first and then increasing in intensity. The identity of \"Blue\" is the cliffhanger of \"Love, Simon,\" and Berlanti has a lot of fun keeping us in suspense. There are many potential candidates, and as Simon drifts from one to the other, wondering, \"Are you Blue? Are you?\" It could be any one of them. One of the beautiful aspects of \"Love, Simon\" is that the intimacy blossoming between the two characters is based on how much they come to care about each other, how much they support one another's journey. The romantic feelings come out of a soul and heart connection. Things get weird when fellow Drama Club member Martin (Logan Miller) enters the scene. He finds out about Simon's secret correspondence and blackmails Simon into helping him get a date with Abby, who wants nothing to do with him. Simon becomes a reluctant hidden puppeteer of the ever-shifting extremely-fraught landscape of various high school romances involving Leah, Nick and Abby, people who are supposed to be his best friends. His manipulations lead to enormous confusion, hurt feelings, emotional chaos, with Simon rationalizing it all to himself as doing what he has to do to protect Blue's identity. If Martin reveals the correspondence to the school, as he threatens to do, then Blue will be scared away for good. The stakes could not be higher. Advertisement Berlanti, who brought us \"Dawson's Creek\" and \"Riverdale,\" knows this teenage territory extremely well. He understands teen neuroses, and cares about teenage experience, its intensities, its depths, how important romance is to the teenage kids engaged in it. There's one scene where Leah shares with Simon how she always feels like she's on the outside looking in. She says, in one of the many wonderful lines in the film, \"I am the kind of person destined to care so much about one person it'll nearly kill me.\" This is how sensitive smart teenagers talk. Screenwriters Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker (whose shared credits include \"This Is Us\" and \"About a Boy\") have a great ear for the undulating rhythms of comedy and pathos. \"Love, Simon\" is filled with humor\u2014in its characters, dialogue, and situations\u2014but it doesn't sacrifice emotional depth. The two work in tandem. Historically, \"coming out\" stories in the movies have involved their own kinds of cliches: torment, tragedy, parental/societal rage, fear of disease, and sometimes even death. Such films underline the perils of living in a homophobic world, of being \"out\" in an atmosphere not just unwelcoming but deadly. These stories are important ones too, and have been breakthroughs in representation. But in mainstream films, playing in a Multplex, the gay characters are still more often than not sidekicks to the hetero leads. Recent films like \"Call Me by Your Name,\" and \"Blue is the Warmest Color\" show characters who are not punished for their sexuality by the world, their parents, their peers, and these films are huge steps forward. But \"Love, Simon\" is a mainstream film for teenagers.\u00a0 I did not see the movie at a press screening surrounded by critics. I went to an audience preview, and the excitement as the lights dimmed was palpable. I noticed no surreptitious checking of cell phones during the film, only an\u00a0energy of complete engagement. People were talking back to the screen or gasping in sympathy or howling with laughter. When Simon's anonymous crush finally revealed his identity, the audience erupted into screams and applause. There was a feeling of cathartic release in the theatre, unique in my experience, especially with teenage rom-com fare. In one poignant scene, Simon's mother says to him, \"You can exhale now, Simon.\" That's what I sensed in the screening of \u201cLove, Simon,\" and that's what the film is. A long overdue exhale.

{"Title": "Annihilation", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Alex Garland\u2019s visionary, unsettling \u201cAnnihilation\u201d doesn\u2019t fall into the same neat categories as so many recent films in what has been a sci-fi genre boom of late. Whether it\u2019s the big films like \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d or the Netflix ones like \u201cMute\u201d and \u201cThe Cloverfield Paradox,\u201d sci-fi is everywhere in the late \u201810s, with most of it owing a great deal to some combination of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001,\u201d Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and the Wachowskis\u2019 \u201cThe Matrix.\u201d Even within this resurgence, rarely do you see a film that\u2019s built from the templates of\u00a0Tarkovsky films like \u201cSolaris\u201d or \u201cStalker,\u201d movies that used sci-fi in a discomfiting, emotional register because, well, that kind of filmmaking is incredibly difficult to pull off. It\u2019s so difficult in fact that Paramount had no idea what to do when they saw \u201cAnnihilation,\u201d barely promoting it, holding it from press until a few days before release, and selling it to Netflix for international markets. Maybe they\u2019re still burned by the failure of \u201cmother!,\u201d but they\u2019re burying a genre gem here, an ambitious, challenging piece of work that people will be dissecting for years. Don\u2019t miss it. Advertisement What looks like a meteor hits a lighthouse in the opening shots of \u201cAnnihilation.\u201d Flash forward, we presume, to a woman being interrogated by a man in a hazmat suit. People watch the interrogation through glass and wear protective masks even though they\u2019re not in the same room with her. Who is this woman? Why is everyone treating her like a biohazard?    Flash back, again we presume, to a time before Lena (Natalie Portman) was possibly radioactive. A successful biologist, Lena seems just about ready to get over the grief of her missing husband\u2014who has been gone on a covert mission for a year and presumed KIA\u2014when he walks up the stairs and into her bedroom. Kane (Oscar Isaac) may be home, but there\u2019s a sense immediately that something is wrong. In a quick flashback, Garland shows us a playful, smiling Kane, so we the viewers can sense along with Lena that something is not right with the dead-eyed man in front of her. Garland is brilliant in the way he parcels out information with a quick scene, line, flashback, etc.\u2014giving us just what we need to process and analyze the action in front of us while also staying one step ahead of us, making us eager to catch up. Then Kane starts spitting up blood.    Before long, Lena is brought to a place called the Southern Reach, a research facility a few miles from that lighthouse in the opening shot. On the horizon, near a tree line, she sees what can best be described as a rainbow wall. Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) informs her that it\u2019s called \u2018The Shimmer,\u2019 and that they have been investigating it for three years now. Past The Shimmer, no radio signals have returned, and no manned missions have produced a survivor \u2026 until her husband. The assumption is that something in there kills people or people go crazy and kill each other. Lena, Dr. Ventress, and three others\u2014tough-talking Anya (Gina Rodriguez), shy Josie (Tessa Thompson), and sweet Cass (Tuva Novotny)\u2014will venture into The Shimmer, get to the lighthouse, and return. Maybe.    If you\u2019re wondering how much has been spoiled at this point in the review, the answer is almost nothing. \u201cAnnihilation\u201d really becomes itself once the team crosses that threshold into the woods, a fascinating setting for a sci-fi flick that reveals itself slowly. This is not an alien planet, and yet there\u2019s a sense of danger and some sort of biological aberration within these woods. Garland reveals just enough at every turn to keep us confused but also in the moment with Lena and the crew. It\u2019s a film that balances disorientation with the grounded performances of its cast, who keep us engaged in each interaction, believing the danger as it unfolds. \u201cAnnihilation\u201d could have easily become campy or silly. If I described some of its scarier scenes, you might laugh, but Garland finds a way to make the insanity work, and watching that balancing act can be invigorating.    Advertisement \u201cAnnihilation\u201d is an exercise in maintaining tone and keeping the action of the piece relatable enough so that it doesn\u2019t spin off into something easily dismissible. Cinematographer Rob Hardy, who also shot \u201cEx Machina,\u201d works with Garland to use the natural world as effectively as the pair used those sleek lines and reflections of the lab in their previous film. And the sound design, especially in the climax, is spectacular, keeping us disoriented and frightened with atonal noises that almost sound like they\u2019re turning in on themselves. Most of all, the artistic success of \u201cAnnihilation\u201d comes down to the way Garland metes out information visually. He\u2019ll often show us one thing and then subvert it with the next image, which is an ambitious but perfect way to tell a story about duality and corruption. There\u2019s also a centerpiece scene involving an attack at night that\u2019s straight-up one of the most terrifying things I\u2019ve ever seen in terms of design and direction. It reminded me of the first time it's clear that everyone is probably\u00a0going to die in\u00a0John Carpenter's \u201cThe Thing.\u201d    There are times when the structure of \u201cAnnihilation\u201d frustrated me just a little bit (although I\u2019m eager to see it again to see if that complaint fades away)\u2014flashbacks within flashbacks often do that\u2014and I\u2019m not sure Garland\u2019s final act works as well as it could have. There\u2019s an inherent problem with mission films like \u201cAnnihilation\u201d in that the journey is almost always more engaging and interesting than the destination. Questions make for better art than answers. However, Garland leaves enough open for discussion that he saves it artistically. And he produces some of his most striking visuals in those closing scenes.    \u201cAnnihilation\u201d is not an easy film to discuss. It\u2019s a movie that will have a different meaning to different viewers who are willing to engage with it. It\u2019s about self-destruction, evolution, biology, co-dependence, and that which scares us the most\u2014that we can no longer trust our own bodies. It's\u00a0meant to linger in your mind and haunt your dreams. In this recent wave of sci-fi films, it's one of the best.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Anomalisa", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "There's everything else happening in America cinema, and then there's whatever Charlie Kaufman is up to.\u00a0 Ever since 1999's \"Being John Malkovich,\" he has been on a short list of American screenwriters whose work is so original that he must be thought of as an auteur, even though film is supposedly a director's medium. Formidable filmmakers have adapted his scripts, including Spike Jonze (\"Malkovich\" and \"Adaptation\") and Michel Gondry (\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" and \"Human Nature\"), but however assured the results, they were still unmistakably Charlie Kaufman movies, speaking their own alternately down-to-earth and elevated language.\u00a0 Advertisement Kaufman's mix of mordant humor, broad slapstick, self-aware storytelling devices, and images and language drawn from psychoanalysis, poetry and dreams coalesced even more strongly in his directorial debut, \"Synecdoche, New York,\" about a playwright spending years (or a lifetime?) rehearsing and rewriting a massive production that was about his life but seemed indistinguishable from it. The undercurrents of wonder and despair ran deeper there than in any other Kaufman story, even \"Eternal Sunshine.\"\u00a0 They course throughout \"Anomalisa\" as well. The film could be described as a midlife crisis drama with puppets, about a depressed corporate efficiency expert (voiced by David Thewlis) who hears every voice, male or female, as the same voice (Tom Noonan's), and who becomes infatuated with a shy young woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who is attending his seminar in Cincinnati, Ohio.\u00a0\"Anomalisa\" is based on an \"audio play\" by Kaufman. It was originally presented as part of a series of such plays, in collaboration with Joel and Ethan Coen and composer Carter Burwell, who has scored movies by both directors, including this one. The actors performed their lines while Burwell conducted a live score and sound effects artists provided background noises.\u00a0Kaufman co-directed this film version with stop-motion animator Duke Johnson, whose work includes the \"Community\" episode \"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas.\" It puts a \"visual track\" to Kaufman's audio play. The puppets are physically recognizable as \"puppets,\" down to the segmented lines of their \"face plates.\" But they move so realistically and speak so naturalistically (even when they're skipping across the tops of desks, as in the image at the top of this page) that there are times when you may forget that they're not people.\u00a0 The puppet characters in most other films are more sprightly. They exist mainly to amuse. The characters in \"Anomalisa\" unsettle.\u00a0Their plight makes you think about 21st century loneliness, despair and alienation\u2014 subjects that would be unpalatable if Kaufman didn't write his characters so compassionately and with such dry humor. Kaufman and Johnson shoot the characters in a carefully considered way, not cutting much, just sort of letting them sit there, and be. There are a few stealthy \"long takes\" in this film that would be much praised if they appeared in a live-action feature\u2014sequences where the filmmakers simply follow characters as they traverse levels of the hotel, or have sex in a slab-like bed.\u00a0 Advertisement It might sound strange to say, but this puppet movie gives you a more accurate sense of what it's like to spend a few days in a nice hotel in a city of bad memories than most live-action films ever do\u2014not that that's necessarily the kind of description that will make people want to rush out and see \"Anomalisa.\" Like so many Kaufman characters, the ones in this movie are struggling, stumbling even, towards what might be a mirage of happiness, while battling both their own social conditioning and pathologies and the bland indifference of the world around them\u2014a world that includes billions of other people who all think they are the stars of their own life-movies, and at times seem deeply frustrated by the fact that they haven't experienced one of those transformative moments that tell moviegoers, \"Everything is going to be fine for this character now, don't worry.\" Thewlis' Michael Stone is clearly unhappy with his work, his marriage, even his child. He seems disconnected from himself and the world. Not much happens to him in the plot sense. His plane touches down in Cincinnati. He settles into the hotel and orders room service while pacing and smoking a cigarette. He impulsively invites an old flame out for a drink hoping to get lucky, oblivious to the fact that he hurt her so terribly that it's painful for her to be in the same room with him.\u00a0 Then he becomes smitten with a guest at the conference, a young woman who wears her hair to one side to hide a scar on her face. Her name is Lisa (Leigh), and she's the only character in the film who has her own voice (everyone else is voiced by Tom Noonan, remember). It's love at first sight\u2014or Michael thinks it is. He seems to view Lisa as a redemptive figure, somebody who will pull him out of his existential malaise. But by that point we've spent enough time with Michael to know that he's not the best judge of what he needs. In fact his judgment is consistently terrible, and in typically Kaufman-esque fashion, we move from feeling for Michael and rooting for him to be happy to wondering if he's got some sort of debilitating emotional or mental condition (beyond the titular disorder). Then we progress into thinking about ourselves as much as Michael, contemplating our own fears, weaknesses, blind spots, and repetitive behaviors in relation to a world that barely seems to notice us.\u00a0 For all its visual audacity and honest feeling, \"Anomalisa\" is a modest, even slight work, aesthetically sealed off from the same reality it engages. It ends a bit abruptly, just when it seemed to be ramping up towards a more definitive statement of some kind, and the general outlines of Michael's story aren't new. (Middle-Aged, Upper Middle-Class Male Grappling with Despair is pretty much a genre by this point.) But there's so much beauty and sadness in it, and so many exquisitely conceived scenes (including an impromptu musical performance that ranks with Kaufman's greatest moments), that it would be miserly to underrate it. Whether you leave the film ecstatically impressed, indifferent or disappointed, you will know you've seen something unique. Too many movies speak in a boringly typical storytelling voice. This one speaks in a voice as singular as Lisa's.   Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Code Black", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The title \"Code Black\" refers to a specific medical condition:\u00a0a patient in cardiopulmonary arrest whose suffering is so great that alleviating it requires a whole team of providers. This documentary by Ryan McGarry, a physician and filmmaker who shot \"Code Black\" while he was a resident at LA County General, tells us of another definition. It was created to describe the condition of the emergency room's waiting area in terms of color-coding. Code Black means things are as bad as they can get. It means the \"system\" that is the county hospital is overwhelmed, as a body is overwhelmed during a heart attack, and may in fact be on the edge of death. As this bleak but sadly illuminating movie shows us, the whole U.S. healthcare system is in Code Black. The advent of limited socialized medicine hasn't begun to ease the misery.\u00a0 Advertisement The problem, as the movie explains, is twofold. There's funding, and then there's paperwork. Medical care costs too much in this country. It's so expensive that a major injury or the onset of a major illness can bankrupt whole families. There's still tremendous resistance to the idea that society should collectively pitch in for everyone's health care, even though, as one doctor in the film explains, everyone already IS paying for everyone else's health care: when poor or working class people with no decent health insurance go to emergency rooms, the taxpayer ends up footing the bill anyway, so getting on a high-horse about it is silly. The question isn't whether you should have to contribute to a stranger's health care, since you already are contributing in the form of taxes; it's what form that contribution will ultimately take, and how efficiently and sensibly the money will be used. The paperwork problem is thornier. As \"Code Black\" points out, emergency medicine as we now know it was created at\u00a0C-Booth, a ward in LA County General that in flashbacks has a touch of the battlefield tent about it. Because\u00a0C-Booth was located in a cramped area of an old building, it was spared some of the usual administrative requirements placed on similar facilities in newer hospitals. The doctors and nurses who worked there were sort of grandfathered in, as professionals empowered to concentrate on treating patients and not worrying so much about dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's. When\u00a0C-Booth moved to a new, state-of-the-art facility in 2008, the waivers disappeared, and now those same healthcare providers talk about spending most of their days filling out paperwork, instead of establishing a rapport with patients and then treating their ailments. Wait times in the waiting rooms began creeping upward. Many patients now wait hours, sometimes whole days, to see a doctor. A few simply give up and go home untreated. \u00a0 What can be done about all this? I don't think McGarry has any solutions, or pretends to have any. This is to his credit. \"Code Black\" is more of a description of a set of conditions, or problems\u2014a diagnosis without a prescription. It's heartfelt and messy. It feels like a pretty good segment of \"60 Minutes\" blown up to feature length. It wants to put a human face on social problems, and sometimes succeeds, but at the cost of getting distracted from the complex arguments it is (often lucidly) making. Perhaps it would have been better as a drier, more analytical piece about systemic ills (a touch of \"Frontline\"). It's more fair-minded than you might expect, given that it's a film about doctors directed by a doctor. It's aware that something fine was lost when\u00a0C-Booth relocated and the paperwork monster swallowed everyone up. But it's also aware that there are a lot of players involved in health care treatment\u2014patients, doctors, nurses, administrative staff, hospitals, hospital networks, health care insurance companies, the government\u2014and that they all demand accountability, as well they should. No one enjoys paperwork. There must be a better way. What is it? Advertisement There are personal portraits in \"Code Black\" as well\u2014sketches of doctors, some young and comparatively new, others seasoned\u2014but they're the weakest part of the movie. They feel more like advertisements for the goodheartedness and fundamental idealism of doctors than actual portraiture, and taken together, they have a whiff of \"good guys versus an anonymous and coldblooded system\" feeling, which one hopes was not the intention. (Recurring scenes of the doctors sitting around a big, well-lit table and shooting the breeze are especially regrettable; they feel like outtakes from an unscripted TV series intended as a timeslot companion to a scripted one.) The movie is at its best when it's immersing you in a series of conundrums and letting you feel what it's like to live with them, and wrestle with them. All of these people are doing the best they can, but the system is broken.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The World Made Straight", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Do feuds ever really end? Is history ever really in the past? \"The World Made Straight\" asks these and other big questions as it adapts Ron Rash's novel, telling the story of a 17-year old North Carolinian who gets tangled up with drug dealers in the mountains sometime in the 1970s, diving deep into film noir/pulp territory while occasionally flashing back to Civil War-era brutality.\u00a0\u00a0The movie never entirely rises to the height of its ambitions, though: there are moments when you can practically hear it straining to impart significance to what is, in the end, a fairly standard sensitive-young-criminal-in-over-his-head story, and the final stretch seems torn between wanting to resolve everything with violence and telling us violence never solves anything. Advertisement You certainly couldn't accuse the novel's adapter, Shane Danielsen or its director David Burris of aiming too low. If you succumb to the film's very deliberate rhythms, there's much to admire here, including the desaturated widescreen photography (by Tim Orr, who has shot many films by David Gordon Green), which seems at least partly inspired by the silvery Civil War photographs of Mathew Brady; the acting, by an admirably focused cast that includes a bearded and deep-voiced Noah Wyle (\"E.R.\") and singer-songwriter Steve Earle; and Earle's score of bluegrass-flavored instrumental cues and quiet yet menacing songs, which enfolds and subsumes the film in the manner of Leonard Cohen's bard-like contributions to \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller.\" Jeremy Irvine of \"War Horse\" stars as Travis, a high school dropout with a good heart but a tendency to take moral shortcuts that set him ever farther back in life. The story begins with Travis getting fired from his grocery store job for giving food to a homeless man; soon he falls in with a pot dealer named\u00a0Leonard (Wyle), who lives in a trailer with his drop-dead-gorgeous blonde girlfriend, Dena (Minka Kelly), a drug addict and unnervingly blatant flirt. Their association begins when Travis cuts a marijuana plant from the property of Carlton (Earle), Leonard's main rival in the region, and sells it to Leonard.\u00a0\u00a0 Here, as elsewhere, the film goes the extra country mile to invest standard crime movie types with rich, eccentric life: Leonard is a former high school teacher who lost his wife, daughter and job in an incident tactically withheld till later in the story, and though he has a honeyed bourbon drawl and a beer-drinker's gut-first walk, there's something intriguingly private and sensitive about him. He keeps Civil War literature in a bookcase above his bathroom toilet, hunts for Civil War relics with a metal detector, and listens to Aaron Copland records, which he somewhat peevishly defends against the complaints of Travis' dull-witted buddy (Haley Joel Osment), who thinks it's terrible and boring. Advertisement Leonard warns Travis that it's not a good idea to steal pot from feared criminals, but the kid won't listen, and during a return trip to Carlton's property, he gets his foot stuck in a bear trap, passes out, and finds himself in Carlton's house, with the bearded, bearish crime boss looming over him. Earle is a revelation here: he's given decent performances elsewhere, notably in David Simon's HBO series \"The Wire\" and \"Treme,\" but this is a full-bodied character turn filled with right-on choices, including the measured, vaguely philosophical way that Carlton delivers threats, as if he's always speaking hypothetically even when describing exactly what he's going to do to someone. After a brief stay in a clinic where Travis is tended by a kind nurse and future love interest named\u00a0Lori (Adelaide Clemens\u00a0of the Sundance series \"Rectify\"), he returns home to his family only to get kicked out, and holes up with Leonard, who takes a somewhat fatherly interest in the young man's fortunes and encourages him to study for his GED.\u00a0 As you've probably gathered, a good portion of \"The World Made Straight\" is an Appalachian-flavored realistic drama about hard people living through hard times. The filmmakers take care to situate the crime, threats and one-upmanship within the context of reality. The houses, cars and clothes seem lived in rather than designed. Orr's photography pays loving attention to the texture of forests and hills and the way that sunlight flashes over a winding road at dawn. And the characters' economic distress always seems practical, never a storytelling conceit. (\"You got too much damn pride to work a day like regular folks,\" his father tells\u00a0the\u00a0hero. \"When's the last time you had a damn job?\" Travis retorts.)\u00a0 In all,\u00a0however, the metaphorical and historical weight that the film\u00a0places\u00a0on the story's shoulders sits rather awkwardly, and the characters just can't bear the weight, even with Earle's plaintive and heroically un-ironic songs ringing out on the soundtrack. Like\u00a0\"Out of the Furnace,\" a present-day crime drama with similar elements that's set in similar terrain (though much farther north), \"The World Made Straight\" never figures out how to smoothly integrate its\u00a0straightforward melodrama and literary pretensions. The music and photography sure are magnificent, though: every frame a painting, every scene a song.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Coldwater", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "What happens when a society built on violent, dictatorial\r\npower faces collapse? How do we deal with violent youths whom we cannot\r\ncontrol? How much freedom should we give those who we allow to shape our\r\nchildren from boys to men? Vincent Grashaw\u2019s SXSW drama \u201cColdwater\u201d tries to deal\r\nwith these challenging questions in the form of a narrative about a juvenile\r\nboot camp, the kind of place that thinks violence and Army training techniques\r\nare the way to deal with teens whose parents no longer have the answers. It\u2019s a\r\npromising topic for a drama, and Grashaw\u2019s talented leading man carries it\r\nuntil the filmmaker steals it from him and destroys everything built up in the\r\nfirst hour. The final act of \u201cColdwater\u201d is horrendously misguided, the kind of\r\ninsincere melodrama that erases the memory of what came before. It\u2019s a\r\nparticular shame because there\u2019s an hour of decent filmmaking here. Advertisement The title refers to a remote location at which parents\r\nessentially give up the protective rights to their children and allow alpha\r\nmales to form them into \u201cbetter citizens.\u201d These places exist, and, as the end\r\ncredits inform us, do so with little governmental oversight, leading to\r\ninjuries and even death. When your son has reached a point where bad behavior\r\nbecomes violent and illegal, what do you do to keep him out of jail? It\u2019s a\r\nserious question facing hundreds of families.  Grashaw clearly believes that places like Coldwater are not\r\nthe answer. From the minute that Brad (P.J. Boudousqu\u00e9) gets there, Coldwater\r\nis painted as a testosterone-heavy corner of Hell. The teens are forced to run\r\nmiles every day, given little water along the way, and that\u2019s the highlight for\r\nmany of them. Sprayed with fire hoses, strung up by their wrists and left\r\novernight, etc.\u2014Colonel Frank (James C. Burns) seems to honestly believe that\r\nhis reform structure will turn boys to men but it\u2019s a harrowing process to do\r\nso. And, perhaps worst of all, Frank has a system in which the \u201cgood kids\u201d\r\nbecome Trustys and eventually employees of Coldwater, which naturally\r\nencourages in-fighting among the barracks. When a friend of Brad\u2019s named Jonas (the naturally talented Octavius\r\nJ. Johnson) gets hit by a counselor-driven ATV on a run, Coldwater starts to\r\nfall apart. The incident brings in some authority figures and Colonel Frank\r\nbegins to sense that his days may be numbered. What happens when a mad man\r\nstarts to lose his control? You can imagine that it gets worse before it gets\r\nbetter. And when one of Brad\u2019s old buddies (Chris Petrovski) comes to\r\nColdwater, it\u2019s the match hitting a lake of gasoline. The majority of what works about \u201cColdwater\u201d for its first\r\nhour can be laid at the feet of Boudousqu\u00e9, who looks like a young Ryan Gosling\r\nand has a bit of that actor\u2019s remarkable internal gravity. The actor is allowed\r\nto essentially play multiple iterations of Brad, as we see flashbacks to what\r\ngot the young man to Coldwater in the first place, watch the struggle of his\r\nearly days, and end with a character who seems broken to the degree that one\r\ncould argue the Colonel\u2019s strategy worked. He\u2019s a shell of a man by the middle\r\nof the film, but he\u2019s more of a man than a rebellious teen. There\u2019s a daring\r\nfilm there\u2014the idea that these facilities are breaking troubled teens down to\r\nthe point that they may be more \u201cmature\u201d but they\u2019ve lost their identities in the\r\nprocess. Advertisement \u201cColdwater\u201d is one of those films that we know can\u2019t\r\npossibly end well, and yet the final act feels unearned and manipulative. The\r\nsubtlety of the performances in the first two acts are discarded for explosions\r\nof violence and surprisingly tidy resolutions. Grashaw offers a climax in the\r\ntraditional sense of the word in that the film almost becomes an action movie,\r\nand strains credulity by taking that route. Instead of the character drama, \u201cColdwater\u201d\r\nbecomes something designed to provoke and thrill in the final act when it\r\nshould be finding the sad truth of troubled youths and people who abuse the\r\npositions of power granted them. It\u2019s as if Grashaw couldn\u2019t stomach the\r\nthought that these kind of nightmarish situations often don\u2019t have the closure\r\nthat filmmaking can provide.

{"Title": "Hateship Loveship", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Johanna Parry (Kristen Wiig) wears sensible lace-up shoes, ankle socks, and linen dresses, with a little cardigan over her shoulders. When she cooks or cleans, she puts on a flowered apron. She is so unworldly that when she is told to \"set up a password\" at the library in order to use the computer, she asks the librarian, \"My own word?\" She has worked in the service of others, as a housemaid/nanny/nurse since she was 15. Her voice is soft and flat, and when she speaks, she uses functional practical language. She has feelings about the families with whom she lives, but you would never guess any of it looking at her face. She has no self-pity. And so, when Johanna suddenly awakens to love, early on in \"Hateship Loveship,\" it is both electrifying and perilous. She is not used to being overwhelmed with feelings, sexual and romantic, and she doesn't know how to behave; she doesn't know where to put it all. Watching Kristen Wiig's lived-in and alive performance as this blunt, practical, and yet totally innocent woman is to be in the presence of something very very special. Advertisement After working in the employ of an elderly woman for most of her life, Johanna (Wiig) gets a job as a housekeeper in Iowa for Mr. McCauley (Nick Nolte) and his feisty teenage granddaughter Sabitha (Hailee Steinfeld). Sabitha's mother was killed when her father Ken (Guy Pearce) crashed their car, drunk at the wheel. He has done time in prison, which is why Sabitha lives with her grandfather. Ken is visiting when Johanna shows up on the doorstep for her first day. He is friendly to her, inviting her out for burgers with his daughter, saying to her off-handedly when she does something helpful, \"Thanks, gorgeous.\" At his comment, something enormous arises from the depths in Wiig's face. We don't know anything about Johanna, not really, and yet the strange blush that creeps up over her face, the sudden smile struggling at her lips, makes us understand everything. Guy Pearce plays Ken as a guy who, despite all of his problems, still has glimmers of the charm and warmth that he probably had as a young guy. His kindness to Johanna is not targeted or creepy, but automatic and casual. He is filled with self-loathing over his mistakes: his drug addiction, being a terrible dad unable to take care of his daughter, and knowing that everyone thinks he is a loser. But watch how he approaches McCauley about a loan for the motel he wants to fix up in Chicago. He \"sells\" it in a way that is almost convincing, what a good investment it will be, how great it all will be when it is done, how it will be the very thing he needs to get his life in order. And Pearce plays him without judgment: Ken is a guy who buys his own lines, at least while he is saying them. It's a complex character, in other words, and \"Hateship Loveship\" lets him be complex. It doesn't ask us to come down on one side or the other. His actions are often reprehensible. And sometimes he is beautifully warm and accepting. Both are true. Sabitha and her friend Edith (Sami Gayle) concoct a cruel joke to play on the new housekeeper, who floats drably around the house, cooking and cleaning and wearing weird clothes. They send her a letter, purportedly from Sabitha's dad, basically saying he can't stop thinking about her ever since they first met, and would she be his friend? Johanna, alone in bed, reads the letter, again with these uncontrollable feelings swarming up from the depths and doing battle on her face. There is an absolutely extraordinary scene, breathtaking in its vulnerability, where Johanna presses her lips up against the bathroom mirror and kisses herself passionately, slobberingly, like she maybe saw in a movie once. The moment could be pathetic. It isn't. It has in it all of the need and yearning of lonely people everywhere. Advertisement Knowing that none of this is real, that Ken never wrote her a letter at all, that he is holed up in a rundown motel by a Chicago freeway with his junkie girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh) makes watching the film an incredibly uneasy experience. We see what happens when a woman who has never been loved, who has never even thought of love as something she could have, is given a glimpse of it. We see how it alters her, utterly. She does not know it is a fiction. A more experienced woman would have seen through the lines in those letters, would have guessed that something was amiss. Johanna is not that woman, and instead of battening down the hatches, she runs towards those letters, to what they express, arms awkward and open. To say any more about the plot would be to ruin the experience of the film. I kept waiting for it to pander, to explain, to judge. It doesn't. The best thing about it is that you literally do not know what will happen next. Christine Lahti shows up as a gossipy bank teller with a big laugh, who has been a business associate of Mr. McCauley for years. Their scenes together are amazing. Sabitha and Edith, young and cruel as they are, are also complex, creating their little game out of conflicting emotions, burgeoning hormones, and boredom. Based on a short story by Alice Munro, \"Hateship Loveship\" is directed by Liza Johnson and shot by cinematographer Kasper Tuxen in a simple and unsentimental style. There is barely any score, and so moments stretch out in their silence, their awkwardness, and their huge unspoken feelings. When music does enter the picture, it is usually from the radio; George Jones or Tammy Wynette in the background. Delicacy is required with such material. Pushing for an emotional response from the audience, or underlining certain moments with music cues or closeups, would tip the film over into melodramatic soap opera. Johnson, instead, holds back. We see characters through doorways, as though we are eavesdropping, glancing in at a life that is going on whether the camera is pointing that way or not. This technique gives the characters room to breathe. Behavior can be unpredictable. Liza Johnson's direction allows for that and encourages it. Advertisement Kristen Wiig is a chameleon, and many of her comedic characters tap into a strain of tragedy that borders on the Greek. There is a great amount of empathy in her work. She enters into the experience of being another human being, and does so invisibly, without fanfare or wanting to be congratulated for her \"bravery\". In the short story on which the film is based, Alice Munro writes of Johanna: \"It was the rare person who took to her, and she'd been aware of that for a long time.\" Wiig has absorbed that character description until Johanna seems as though a role she was born to play. There is not a hint of condescension in her portrayal. You worry for her. You are embarrassed for her. You feel protective; you wince at her openness. You keep discovering how much you have under-estimated her. It's a great performance.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Calvary", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The second feature written and directed by the prodigiously\r\ntalented Irishman John Michael McDonagh opens with a quote from Saint\r\nAugustine: \u201cDespair not, one of the thieves was spared; presume not, one of the\r\nthieves was not.\u201d (It is no accident that this bit of wisdom is cited in\r\n\u201cWaiting For Godot,\u201d an obscure theatrical work by another talented Irishman\r\nname of Beckett.) Later in the movie, Fiona (Kelly Reilly) the daughter of\r\nCounty Sligo priest James Lavelle (Brendan Gleeson)\u2014Lavelle took the vows after\r\nhis wife, Fiona\u2019s mother, died years earlier\u2014takes confession with her literal\r\nand spiritual father, and, obliquely addressing the troubles that informed her\r\nrecent, half-hearted suicide attempt, asserts, \u201cI belong to myself, not to\r\nanyone else.\u201d To which Father James responds, \u201cTrue. False.\u201d  Advertisement A mordant sense of duality that eventually takes on\r\nnear-apocalyptic dimensions runs through this very darkly comic tale, telling a\r\nweek in the life of Father James. Sunday kicks off pretty horribly. A man\r\nostensibly offering Father James his confession explicitly describes his sexual\r\nabuse at the hands of the priest years earlier, and outline his plan for\r\nrevenge: he intends to kill a \u201cgood priest\u201d in exactly a week. He means for\r\nthat good priest to be Father James, and invites him to a beach spot to meet\r\nhis doom. This disturbs James, as well it might. But he does not go to\r\nthe authorities. Instead, he tends to his flock, such as it is. And a more\r\nperverse bunch would be hard to find anywhere else than in a provincial, lonely\r\nIrish remote. There\u2019s the local butcher (Chris O\u2019Dowd), who might well be\r\nslapping around his sexpot wife (Oria O\u2019Rourke), who\u2019s brazenly conducting an\r\naffair with an African immigrant auto mechanic (Isaach de Bankole). The local\r\nbarkeep\u2019s a ball of resentment, the town\u2019s most dapper young man is completely\r\nsocially inept, the police chief\u2019s a glib sourpuss who makes no attempt to\r\ndisguise the fact that he does business with a manic,\r\nJimmy-Cagney-impersonating male prostitute. The local hospital biggie is a\r\nmonstrously cynical atheist with a monstrous anecdote to explain his poor\r\nattitude. The local fat cat is swilling in his ale, and worse, at his manse\r\nafter being abandoned by his wife and child. And so on. It is again no accident\r\nthat the only characters who are at all kind to Father James, besides his\r\ndaughter, are non-Irish ones: a very aged American ex-pat author (M. Emmett\r\nWalsh, whose presence is extremely welcome despite his looking like death\r\nwarmed over, which admittedly works for the character), determined to off\r\nhimself before he goes completely decrepit, and a French widow (Marie Jos\u00e9e Croze)\r\nwho commiserates with Father James after he performs last rites on her husband. McDonagh\u2019s structuring is unusual: almost all the\r\nscenes are what are referred to in the theater as \u201ctwo handers,\u201d that is,\r\nexchanges between only two characters. Each scene tackles a particular\r\nvariation on the movie\u2019s theme, which is the earning of forgiveness, and\r\nwhether taking what\u2019s said to be the right action is sufficient to do so.\r\nGleeson\u2019s performance is magnificent; sharp, compassionate, bemused, never not\r\nintellectually active. McDonagh\u2019s dialogue is similarly never not sharp, and\r\nonly occasionally lost to an actor\u2019s Irish accent. As the picture progresses,\r\nFather James\u2019 parishioners morph from a group of perverse individuals to one of\r\nintransigently spiteful lunatics. McDonagh takes considerable risks, in this\r\nday and age, crafting what\u2019s essentially an absurdist allegory. By the film\u2019s\r\nfinale, this viewer felt that one or two of the risks didn\u2019t entirely pay off,\r\nbut my admiration for McDonagh\u2019s brass remained intact. This is the kind of\r\nmovie that galvanizes and discomfits while it\u2019s on screen, and is terrific\r\nfodder for conversation long after its credits roll. Even if you are neither\r\nCatholic nor Irish, this \u201cCalvary\u201d will in no way be a useless sacrifice of your moviegoing time. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Jungle Book", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "I saw the newest Disney version of \"The Jungle Book\" in the company of my enthralled 12-year-old son, and there were moments when I envied him\u2014but not too many, because the film is so surefooted in its effects, so precise and simple in its characterizations, and so clear about what it's trying to say about the relationship between humanity and nature, that it made me feel about his age again, too. Maybe younger. From the opening sequence of young Mowgli (Neel Sethi) racing through the jungle in the company of his adoptive wolf family and his feline guardian, the black panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley), through its comic setpieces with the layabout Baloo the Bear (Bill Murray) and its sinister interludes with the python Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), the despot orangutan King Louie (Christopher Walken), and the scarred Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba), the movie bears you along on a current of enchantment, climaxing in a thunderous extended action sequence that dazzles while tying off every lingering plot point, and gathering up all the bits of folklore, iconography, and Jungian dream symbols that have been strewn throughout the story like Hansel and Gretel's breadcrumbs.  Advertisement It's not accurate to call this \"Jungle Book\" a \"live-action\" version, since so much of it has been generated on a computer. But screenwriter Justin Marks, director Jon Favreau and their hundreds of collaborators render such distinctions moot. Combining spectacular widescreen images of rain forests, watering holes and crumbling temples, a couple of human actors, and realistic mammals, birds and reptiles that nevertheless talk, joke and even sing in celebrity voices, the movie creates its own dream-space that seems at once illustrated and tactile. It's the sort of movie you might inadvertently dream about after re-reading one of Rudyard Kipling's source books or re-watching the 1967 animated Disney film, both of which contributed strands of this one's creative DNA.  The Disney animated version was the last cartoon feature personally  overseen by Walt Disney, and its release one year after his death  marked the start of a period of creative wandering for the company (though other  features that had been in development for years, most of them lackluster, would appear throughout  the decade that followed). Like a lot of the company's 1960s and '70s  output, it was relaxed to a fault\u2014a succession of beautifully rendered,  mostly jokey set-pieces strung together by memorable songs, including  \"The Bare Necessities,\" \"I Wanna Be Like You\" and the python\u2019s seduction song \"Trust in Me\"\u2014but it still made a deep impression on  '60s and '70s kids like the 49-year-old Favreau. This incarnation is a more straightforward telling that includes just two brief, according-to-Hoyle musical numbers, \"The Bare Necessities\" and  \"I Wanna Be Like You\"\u2014performed by Sethi with Murray and Walken,  respectively. It relegates a longer version of the ape's song and a  torch-song-y version of \"Trust in Me,\" performed by Johansson, to the  approximately seven-minute end credits sequence, which is so intricately  imagined as to be worth the ticket price by itself. Other numbers, including the elephants' marching song and \"That's What Friends Are For,\"\u00a0performed by a barbershop quartet of mop-topped vultures, are MIA, presumably in the interest of pacing.  I mention all this not because I consider the film's lack of music a shortcoming, but because it gives some indication of how gracefully this \"Jungle Book\" juggles the competing interests of parents and kids. Musically, visually and tonally, there are enough nods to the 1967 version to satisfy nostalgia buffs, but not so many that the film becomes a glorified rehash. Kipling's tales are a stronger influence, down to the scenes where the wolves, Mowgli and other creatures recite a stripped-down version of Kipling's poem \"The Law of The Jungle\" (\"...For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf/and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack\"). And there are nods to Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan stories and the masterful comics illustrator Burne Hogarth's adaptations, which seem to have influenced the way the movie's CGI artists render the movie's trees: as gnarled, knuckled, pretzel-twisted, vine-shrouded wonders, rising from the forest floor.  Advertisement The film creates its own, more politically evolved version of Kipling's literary ecosystem, with its ancient animal beliefs and practices, such as predators and prey declaring a \"water truce\" during a drought so that they can all drink unmolested from a parched watering hole. And it invests Mowgli with a touch of optimistic environmentalist fantasy: where human mastery of fire and tools was presented in earlier films as a threat, and Mowgli's fated exit from the jungle as an unfortunate necessity, in this film the boy is shown using his ingrained ingenuity to solve problems beyond the capabilities of his animal pals, as when he builds a rappel and pulley system to help Baloo claim honey from a cliffside beehive he's been coveting. The idea here seems to be that humanity is not necessarily fated to subjugate and destroy nature. People and animals can live in harmony if we behave with kindness and mercy while showing reverence for the ancients of other species, like the elephants that Bagheera credits with creating the rain forest and directing the flow of water by digging canals with their hooves and tusks. The movie takes these ideas and others seriously, but in a matter of fact way, so that they don't feel clumsily superimposed, but rather discovered within a text that has existed for more than a century. Kingsley's unhurried storybook narration hypnotizes the audience into buying everything Favreau shows us, as surely as Johansson's Kaa voice-work hypnotizes Mowgli. (The latter sequence includes one of the new movie's most extraordinary embellishments: as Mowgli stares into one of Kaa's eyes, he sees his own origin story play out within it.)  Another kind of balancing act is happening in the voice actors' performances. Favreau leans on distinctive-sounding stars to earn knowing chuckles from the audience, and lets some of their familiar physical and facial tics seep into the animal \"performances\": Murray is a shambling pleasure-seeker in life as well as in many of his movie roles. Walken is legendarily good at playing funny-scary villains who love to mess with heroes' minds (he's merged here with Marlon Brando's performance as Kurtz in \"Apocalypse Now,\" entering the story swathed in Rembrandt gloom). Kingsley has aged into one of the cinema's great mentor figures. And so on.  Advertisement But the film is never content to use our affection for its voice actors as a storytelling crutch. These are strong, simple, clearly motivated characters, not movie star cameos wrapped in CGI fur. The most impressive is Elba's Khan. His loping menace is envisioned so powerfully that he'd be scary no matter what, but the character becomes a great villain through imaginative empathy. As was the case with Magua in Michael Mann's \"The Last of the Mohicans\" and General Zod in \"Man of Steel,\" we understand and appreciate his point-of-view even though carrying it out would mean the death of Mowgli.  In every way, this quietly majestic film should be considered a triumph. The familiar, picaresque story of a young boy raised by forest creatures  but fated to re-join Man has been re-imagined as a funny, scary,  affecting family  adventure with mythic heft but a refreshing lack of swagger. It was made with the latest in movie-making technology but has the ethical values and wide-net storytelling sensibility of an Old Hollywood classic. At its best it feels as though it always existed and we are only now discovering it.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "A Quiet Place", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "John Krasinski\u2019s \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is a nerve-shredder. It\u2019s a movie designed to make you an active participant in a game of tension, not just a passive observer in an unfolding horror. Most of the great horror movies are so because we become actively invested in the fate of the characters and involved in the cinematic exercise playing out before us. It is a tight thrill ride\u2014the kind of movie that quickens the heart rate and plays with the expectations of the audience, while never treating them like idiots. In other words, it\u2019s a really good horror movie. Advertisement With his script, co-written by Bryan Woods and Scott Beck, Krasinski wastes no time. We see a family\u2014Krasinski plays the unnamed father, his real-life wife Emily Blunt plays the mother, and Noah Jupe (\u201cSuburbicon\u201d), Millicent Simmonds (\u201cWonderstruck\u201d), and Cade Woodward play their three children. The eldest, the girl, is deaf (as is the remarkable young actress who plays her). A title card says it\u2019s \u201cDay 89,\u201d and we can tell we\u2019re in a recently-post-apocalyptic world. The family very slowly\u2014on tiptoes\u2014moves around a small-town store, taking some of the few remaining supplies and some prescription drugs for the older boy, who looks like he has the flu. They communicate in sign language and are incredibly careful not to make a sound, but the youngest boy draws a picture of a rocket on the floor\u2014the thing that he signs will take them all away.    We quickly discern that sound in this world is dangerous. And the danger is intensified in the following sequence as the youngest child finds a toy that makes noise and ...\u00a0things don\u2019t end well. The bulk of \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d takes place over a year later, as the family continues to grieve and the mother is about 38 weeks pregnant. Preparing for the arrival of a newborn baby in a world without noise is difficult, and the father continues to pore over newspaper articles and research, looking for a way to stop the creatures that kill at the slightest sound.    Larger-than-life enemies that can detect their prey aurally have been a part of great cinema for years, from the xenomorph hunting the crew of the Nostromo in \u201cAlien\u201d to the dinosaurs of \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d and Krasinski knows that lineage. He\u2019s incredibly smart about the way he brings the viewer into this auditory game. He\u2019s regularly\u2014but not too regularly\u2014setting up what could be called 'auditory expectations.' He\u2019ll show us a shotgun or an exposed nail in the floor or a timer in silence\u2014and we know full well what sounds those are likely to produce. Don\u2019t worry\u2014Krasinski doesn\u2019t overplay it at all. There aren\u2019t rooms of wind chimes or broken glass. It\u2019s a very subtle, clever storytelling tool to build tension when a\u00a0director and his co-screenwriters aren\u2019t allowed to use dialogue to do so, and it pulls us into this world in a way that's unexpected and incredibly enjoyable. Advertisement It also helps that Krasinski displays a sense of composition and economic storytelling that he hasn\u2019t really before in other films. \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d is a no-nonsense, lean movie\u2014the best kind when it comes to thrillers. It feels like every shot has been considered incredibly carefully as the film ticks like a clock on a bomb, perfectly balancing scares with scenes that set up the emotional stakes and the world of these characters. The film has a beautiful sense of geography, almost all of it taking place on a farm that Krasinski and his technical team lay out in a way that allows us to feel like we know it. This is not one of those films that mistakes shaky camerawork for horror storytelling. It\u2019s got a refined visual language that plays beautifully with perspective and the terrifying nature of a world in which we can\u2019t yell to warn/find people or, in the case of the deaf daughter, hear what\u2019s coming.    On that note, there\u2019s also\u2014without spoiling anything\u2014a strong, enabling message at the core of \u201cA Quiet Place.\u201d It\u2019s a film that\u2019s about empowerment more than sheltering, and it\u2019s that emotional hook that really elevates the final act. It helps a great deal that Krasinski completely sticks the landing. It has one of the best final shots in horror in years\u2014and, of course, it comes with a familiar auditory cue that had the audience here at SXSW cheering.    With almost no dialogue, \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d relies a great deal on visual storytelling, but I'll admit that it\u00a0also uses the crutches of composer Marco Beltrami's\u00a0strings for jump scares a bit too much. It\u2019s total conjecture, but one can almost sense Platinum Dunes head Michael Bay insisting on those devices, and I\u2019d love to see a version of \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d that\u2019s even sparser in terms of on-the-nose choices like sound-scares and an overheated\u00a0score.\u00a0 We live in a such a noisy world that it\u2019s hard to imagine that constant sound being taken away. We use noise to express ourselves\u2014it\u2019s a part of who we are as people. And \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d weaponizes that part of the human condition in a way that owes a debt to films like \u201cAlien\u201d but also charts its own new ground. So many great horror films are about people who have to adapt to survive\u2014they have to challenge their own insecurities or preconceptions to make it through the night. In that sense, great horror films are often about empowerment, taking away that which some might perceive as weak. \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d shreds the nerves, but it does so in a way that feels rewarding. You don\u2019t just walk out having experienced a thrill ride, you walk out on a high, the kind of high that only comes from the best horror movies.

{"Title": "The Treasure", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The Romanian director Corneliu Porumboiu has a style that\u2019s likely\u2014and I\u2019m being super-optimistic here\u2014a potentially acquired taste for mainstream American moviegoers. His best-known picture in this country is 2009\u2019s \u201cPolice, Adjective,\u201d a tense and mordantly funny drama whose examination of the ethics of law-enforcement (which climaxes in a marathon scene centered around the definition of the word \u201cpolice,\u201d hence the movie\u2019s title) gained extra resonance for being made and set in a country that was for much of the 20th century more or less a police state. His best movies embody a kind of stylistic paradox: they are slow-paced, but also narratively concise; they contain long, slow scenes in which nothing in particular \u201chappens\u201d but they also feel entirely fat-free.\u00a0 Advertisement \n Porumboiu\u2019s new picture \u201cThe Treasure\u201d is entirely in keeping with that mode but also expands on it, with disarmingly delightful results. It is in a sense the director\u2019s first out-and-out comedy, and it\u2019s also something of a fairytale. No sooner has the movie begun, with working man Costi (Toma Cuzin) invoking Robin Hood to gain his son\u2019s pardon for picking him up from school late, than the not-thematically-unrelated premise pops up: Costi\u2019s neighbor Adrian (Adrian Parcarescu) knocks on the door and requests an 800 Euro loan. Costi\u2019s pretty strapped for cash himself, so he demurs, but soon Adrian is spinning an intriguing tale: he wants the money to buy a metal detector to go searching for buried treasure in the yard of a relative\u2019s house in the country.\u00a0 \n It\u2019s a ridiculous idea on its face, and Costi\u2019s wife implies as much, as they sit in their kitchen and discuss it. The white tile of that room is identical to that seen in Adrian\u2019s apartment, and it brings home the humdrum nature of existence for the lower middle class in Bucharest; it\u2019s like they\u2019re all actually living on the set of \u201cTHX-1138.\" And even Costi and Adrian\u2019s soon-shared dream of riches has a societal catch: if what they uncover is determined to have \u201cstate heritage\u201d value they\u2019re obliged to turn over the find to authorities, who will allow the duo to have 30% of its worth. Costi soon finds a metal-detector/treasure hunting \u201cexpert\u201d named Cornel (Corneliu Cozmei) who\u2019s willing to cut some corners and most importantly not rat out the fellows, and soon they\u2019re in the village of Islaz with picks and shovels and a metal detector whose annoying noise means real encouragement for their prospects. \n Once there, the fellows discover that digging for treasure is no picnic, and Porumboiu is painstaking in depicting the hard labor and quiet frustration. By this time the movie has found a quiet comic tone that\u2019s terrifically dry and droll. Trying to mask his activities from his boss, Costi goes along with that fellow\u2019s suggestions that he\u2019s involved in an extramarital affair, which admission first elicits the man\u2019s nudge-nudge-wink-wink approval, then his mild disapprobation. It\u2019s good absurdist stuff, a little reminiscent of the work of Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki, albeit without that filmmaker\u2019s wooly-headed whimsy. It does help, though, to be a good \u201cGodot\u201d person if you\u2019re going to appreciate the push-me/pull-you tensions of the digging scene. Advertisement \n After which come a few twists, which lead up to a denouement that, surprisingly enough, may prove richly satisfying to viewers more accustomed to conventional fare, provided they\u2019ve been able to stick it out. The film\u2019s final scene is both charming and hilarious and puts a delightful ribbon on top of what the film\u2019s opening so sneakily established. I\u2019m not sure if Porumboiu\u2019s choice of a closing song\u2014it\u2019s by Laibach, just to let you know\u2014is meant to undercut the ending or not. I don\u2019t think it does. And even if it does, I\u2019m not too concerned.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "King Arthur: Legend of the Sword", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Guy Ritchie is that fun friend whose texts you don\u2019t always return because his energy level is always cranked up to 10, and even when you\u2019re in the mood for him, he still wears you out. His best entertainments are 1990s lad mag confections, chock full of funny, well-dressed, hardboiled men (and a couple of women) who bust each other\u2019s chops when they aren\u2019t joining forces to steal something. They\u2019re the kinds of films you forget exist until you stumble across them and end up watching the whole thing again because the tone is just right\u2014edgy but lighthearted\u2014and never for a moment does the movie pretend that watching it is going to make you a better person. \u201cLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,\u201d his two Sherlock Holmes films, \u201cSnatch,\u201d the bizarre self-help action film \u201cRevolver\u201d and 2015\u2019s unexpectedly marvelous \u201cThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u201d are assortments of savory treats presented in the most stylish boxes Ritchie can devise. But there are times when Ritchie makes his own style the star of the film, crowding out the actors and the story because neither is terribly interesting. The result is an oxymoron: a frenetic slog. That\u2019s unfortunately what happens to \u201cKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword,\u201d a knowingly anachronistic riff on the legend starring Charlie Hunnam. This version envisions Arthur as a working-class hero with entirely contemporary sensibilities. He was raised in a brothel after his father and mother were murdered by his uncle Vortigern (Jude Law). Vortigern is an unworthy King of England and a pampered sadist who owes a supernatural debt to the Lady of the Lake, envisioned here as a mass of CGI tentacles enfolding three women, one plump and the others slender and curvy.\u00a0 Ritchie and his cowriters,\u00a0Lionel Wigram and Joby Harold, aren\u2019t interested in historical fidelity because the historical Arthur was a mystery anyway and they\u2019re mainly having fun here. They take Arthur\u2019s childhood trauma seriously (he keeps re-experiencing it in nightmare form, like Bruce Wayne remembering his own parents\u2019 murder by a mugger) but ultimately treat it mainly as the centerpiece for a standard-issue \u201chero\u2019s journey,\u201d one that owes quite a bit to the \"Star Wars,\" \"The Matrix\"\u00a0and \"Lord of the Rings\"\u00a0films. When he pulls the sword from the stone, he, we and the baddies all know that he is truly The One; when he grips it with both hands and then swings, the earth trembles and the camera starts whirling in circles around and around CGI Charlie Hunnam and his adversaries, in the manner of a video game with 3-D graphics. This Arthur wears what looks like a brown leather bomber jacket, sports a 2016 movie star haircut, calls everybody \u201cmate,\u201d and makes a big show of not wanting to get involved in politics, much less embrace his destiny. That is, until circumstances require him to round up a crew of hyper-competent misfit outsiders and depose the kind heist-movie style, treating every skirmish and siege as if it were another vault that the \u201cSnatch\u201d guys were hoping to empty. The future Knights of the Round Table are just as contemporary. They\u2019re a multicultural crew: this film\u2019s Sir George is nicknamed Kung Fu George, tutors Arthur in martial arts, and is played by Hong Kong-born actor Tom Wu; Sir Bedivere is a Moor played by Beninese movie star Djimon Hounsou. And the Anglo actors\u2019 characters get a dusting of Dickensian chimney soot to enhance their rough-and-ready bona fides.\u00a0The future Sir William (Aiden Gillen), master of the longbow, goes by Goosefat Bill Wilson. I love all this stuff in theory\u2014it\u2019s not far from what Martin Scorsese did in \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ,\u201d populating ancient Jerusalem with New Yorkers, Midwesterners and Brits who spoke in their native accents and used modern slang, slicing and dicing the action into music video beats, and scoring the whole thing with Peter Gabriel\u2019s chants and synth beats. The Ritchie sense of style suits a revisionist approach. He\u2019s as slick and easygoing as a rock and roller showman can be, and because the totality of the film is so knowingly absurd\u2014in addition to the slow-motion, acrobatic swordfights, there are gigantic CGI snakes, rats, wolves, and Godzilla-sized Indian elephants\u2014the whole thing feels like a lark even when the characters are being beaten, tortured and executed. There are even moments when Hunnam, not an actor exactly known for his scalawag charm, evokes Errol Flynn\u2019s devil-may-care jerk incarnation of Robin Hood. Astrid Berg\u00e8s-Frisbey\u2019s\u00a0version of Guinevere, a witch whose eyes go black when she summons dark forces, is a fresh variation on the character, though it would\u2019ve been nice if Ritchie had allowed her to crack a few jokes like the boys.\u00a0 No, the real problem is that the movie is unmodulated from start to finish. It never lets up in the exact way that a cocaine addict who wants to tell you his life story before closing time never lets up. Michael Bay has often been accused of turning in feature length motion pictures so over-edited that they feel like trailers for themselves, but I don\u2019t think Bay has ever made a movie as frantically, pointlessly, tediously busy as \u201cKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword.\u201d Not content to do that time-tested Guy Ritchie story-about-a-story thing in every other scene of the picture\u2014you know, the bit where a character tells an audience, \u201cAnd then I sez to him,\u201d and the movie cuts to the same character five days earlier saying, \u201cPut down the money, mate!\u201d\u2014the film does it constantly for two hours, dicing dialogue, performances and story points into microscopic narrative particles that disintegrate in the mind. On one level, you have to admire the skill necessary to tell a story in this manner. You can\u2019t just make a six-hour film and then cut it down to two. You have to think about how every piece, no matter how small or large, will fit with every other piece when the whole narrative is stitched together. But the downside of this strategy is that it doesn\u2019t allow room for any single moment to truly live and breathe, and it\u2019s in such moments that we really get to know a character and care about what happens to them. The emotional heavy lifting that might be done by acting, writing and careful direction is done here in shortcut form by whooshing, tilting, diving camerawork, ominous \u201cwhoosh\u201d and \u201cboom\u201d noises on the soundtrack, and other signifiers of awesomeness.\u00a0 There\u2019s so much narrative and visual motion, such fast cutting, such loud music, and so many rapid shifts of time and place that on those rare occasions when the movie slows down and lets two characters speak to each other, in relative quiet and at length, it feels as if something\u2019s gone wrong with the projection. Ritchie keeps rushing us along for two hours, as if to make absolutely certain that we never have time to absorb any character or moment, much less revel in the glorious, cheeky ridiculousness of the whole thing. The entire movie is an information delivery device with top-dollar production values, forever mistaking getting to the point for the point itself. It\u2019s the legend of King Arthur as told by an auctioneer. I\u2019m not sold.    Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Quest", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"When you talk to people, you find out they're not as hard as they appear to be.\" - Christopher \"Quest\" Rainey Every\u00a0Friday, Christopher Rainey hosts a \"Freestyle\" night in Everquest Recordings, his small music studio located in the basement of his North Philadelphia home. \"Freestyle Fridays\" are a tradition in the neighborhood, the one night of the week when hopeful hip-hop artists\u2014or anyone who can put some rhymes together\u2014hang out and let off steam at the mic. Children sit on the sidewalk outside the basement windows, trying to hear what's going on. Surrounded by friends crowding around the mic, with Chris Rainey at the control panel, these young men don't have to be \"hard\" anymore. They can be joyful, free, angry, hurt, human. \"These young men need someone to talk to,\" Rainey says. \"They need someone to give them encouragement.\" Over the course of \"Quest,\" Jonathan Olshefski's extraordinary documentary almost a decade in the making, \"Freestyle Fridays\" emerge as an anchor, not only for the film, but for the Rainey family and members of the community. Advertisement \"Quest\" is the story of 10 years in one family's life. The film opens with the marriage of Christopher and Christine\u2019a (known as \"Ma Quest,\" even though she says,\"I don't want to be everybody's mom but somewhere along the line, they just started calling me Ma.\") The couple had been together for years, and both came into the relationship with adult children from prior relationships. They have one child together, a girl named P.J., 8 years old at the start of the film, who wants to be a drummer, or maybe a DJ. Christine'a works in a homeless shelter and Chris has an early-morning paper route. One of Christine'a's adult sons, William, lives with them. He has been diagnosed with a brain tumor and has an infant son. We get to know the family's routines. Christine'a braids Chris' hair, braids P.J.'s hair. The black cat purrs in P.J.'s lap. Chris walks P.J. to the school bus, quizzing her on the Presidential campaign going on (Obama's re-election). And every\u00a0Friday\u00a0night, the rappers show up to freestyle in the basement. Only 90 minutes long, the film feels intimate and yet at the same time vast. It has a relaxed pace, but an intensity of focus. Editor Lindsay Utz had to sift through 300 hours of footage and somehow craft it into a narrative. The project started when Chris Rainey's brother took Olshefski to visit Everquest Recordings. Olshefski had never made a documentary before, and he initially thought of doing a photography project about Everquest, but eventually abandoned that idea and decided to broaden the scope. What interested him was Chris and Christine'a, as people. They are both riveting to watch, and even more so to listen to. Maybe it is because they approach life from a thoughtful and deep place, even as the slings and arrows come at them from every which way. They opened themselves to the filming process, they allow us to see them, in times good and bad. There is not a sense of exploitation here, even when things get really tough (and they get extremely tough). The couple is a co-creator in this project with Olshefski. He embedded himself in the family, more or less, for the next decade. We see William struggling with chemo, Christine'a reveling in being a grandmother, Chris taking one of \"his\" rappers\u2014a talented but troubled young man named Price\u2014to task for going down the wrong path. Halfway through the film comes a random tragedy that will mark P.J.\u2014and the family\u2014forever. What makes \"Quest\" special is that none of these story elements are prioritized as more important than others. It's all important. Because that's how life is, on the ground, as you are living it. It's not that the film doesn't make its points. It does. But the narrative cannot be boiled down into a cliched Thesis Statement. Since it takes place over the course of a decade, it is clear what does change and what does not. Moments where news items flash on the TV screen in the house\u2014Obama's re-election night, Obama's post-Sandy Hook speech, Hurricane Sandy\u2014anchor the film down into specific dates, but other than that, Olshefski gives an impression of the flow of time. Advertisement When I hear people cautioning others to not \"politicize\" certain events, I wonder what world they live in. It's an extremely privileged point of view. Politics is not theoretical, it affects our everyday world in the most intimate ways. Whoever's in charge can impact our lives, our futures, with a swipe of his pen. A school shooting is inherently \"politicized,\" whatever side of the fence you stand on. \"Quest\" takes place during Obama's two terms in office, with the Rainey family heavily involved in the re-election campaign, watching as the returns come in. \"I wish my mom woulda seen this,\" says Christine'a. \"She'd be trippin'.\" The neighborhood they live in is a close-knit one, but with out-of-control elements, and after a couple of people die in corner shootouts, residents take to the streets, calling for a stop to the violence. The rage is palpable. Late in the film, Chris and Christine'a are shown watching Trump's now-infamous, \"African-Americans, what the hell do you have to lose?\" campaign speech, and their faces recoil in disgust. \"How does he know how we live?\" murmurs Christine'a. He doesn't. There's a beautiful scene when the neighborhood throws a party for P.J. on her return home. People eat food, do back-flips down the street. Kids run around. The Everquest hip hop artists, including Price, do welcome-home raps for P.J. Music blasts, and all the ladies jump up to do a group line-dance in the middle of the street. The mood is pure joy and hilarity. The neighborhood cops are there, too, holding paper plates of food, and laughing in admiration at P.J.'s basketball dribbling skills. It's a community. \"Freestyle Fridays\" represent a fragile microcosm of the whole. It is a place where\u2014in the midst of struggles to make ends meet, health issues, political wrangling far away\u2014people can come and speak their minds and be supported. Watching the film makes you think, \"This space must be protected. It represents the best of us. It shows us who we are when we decide to take care of each other.\"", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Horse Money", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Pedro Costa's first narrative film in nine years, \"Horse Money,\" is as gorgeous and impenetrable as a dream. It might be set in an afterlife where souls contemplate their lives (and their mistakes, and their misfortunes), or there might be something else to it; like many of the Portuguese filmmaker's works, this one teases and baffles but refuses to explain itself. It makes a quartet of what was once called the\u00a0Fontainhas Trilogy. It is named after the poor neighborhood in Lisbon where Costa originally went with 35mm film equipment to make a lush dramatic feature in the 1990s, only to abandon it and shoot the film with a small video camera\u2014a decision that led Costa down the path that eventually developed his unique aesthetic, which is simultaneously gritty and glossy, a look that delves into the emotional essence of experience by bypassing the signifiers of \"realism\" entirely. Advertisement The film's main character is the 60-year old\u00a0Ventura, a working class Cape Verdean immigrant. He's playing a highly stylized version of himself in situations drawn from his own life, developed in conversations with his friend Costa. Ventura was the star of Costa's last film, \"Colossal Youth,\" and although Costa has suggested that Ventura, never a professional actor anyway, probably doesn't have any more movies left in him, one hopes that they will continue to work together, because theirs is one of the great actor-director collaborations in recent cinema.\u00a0 The intervening years since their last film together have not been kind to Ventura. He (or the character? is there a difference?) has a nerve disease that makes his hands shake. Where he seemed mysterious and implacable, rock-like at times, in much of \"Colossal Youth,\" here he seems mostly regretful and anxious and often terrified. His lack of vanity as he confronts his own physical decline verges on heroic. There is no vanity in this performance.\u00a0 Even if there were, though, Costa's filmmaking would've undercut it. He shoots Ventura's face, and the faces of all the other actors, in tight closeups and in harshly lit long shots that emphasize the shapes of their bodies and the creases in their faces. Tears well up in Ventura's eyes as he lingers in the pitch-black halls and rooms of an unnamed mental hospital, occasionally leaving and being brought back by authorities. There are other inmates in there with him. A\u00a0group\u00a0of inmates appears, materializes almost, by his bedside early on. They share their own life stories. They are laborers, criminals. They are the\u00a0dispossessed, the oppressed.\u00a0 Ventura is tripping down memory lane to such a degree that he seems to be suffering from dementia, but it might just be a Willy Loman or \"The Singing Detective\" type of situation\u2014heavy on metaphorically ripe scenarios, but less affected than a stage play or time-jumping film might be, because the past is described verbally but not envisioned in flashback. In one scene, Ventura tells a doctor that he is a teenager and has been taken to the hospital by the\u00a0the MFA, the Portuguese revolutionary army ended the African colonial war and won independence for Cape Verde. In a lot of Ventura's monologues, he thinks he is 19, or that it's 1975.\u00a0 Advertisement Costa's compositions enfold him in the gloom of regretful memory as he speaks. He is visited by figures from his past, including\u00a0\u00a0Vitalina (Vitalina Varela), a woman who has returned to Lisbon from Cape Verde to bury her husband, who died three days earlier. Ventura assures her that her husband is \"here with me,\" but we aren't sure how to take that. Here in the hospital? Here in Ventura's heart? The movie is content with not knowing, even though the not-knowing may confuse or even infuriate the viewer. The film's final stretch is dominated by Ventura's ride in an elevator with a gun-toting soldier who never speaks. He just stands there like a statue. At times you aren't sure if he's alive. Are any of the characters alive?\u00a0 You'll see the word \"dream\" used a lot in descriptions of the movie. The stark, high-contrast cinematography aims for the sort of effect rarely conjured outside of a German Expressionist movie from the 1920s, or the noir-est of film noir, two modes that often posed their stories in someplace other than recognizable reality\u2014a psychological space where feelings dictate the shape and texture of the frame and the way the characters behave within it. The title refers to a horse that was torn apart by vultures.\u00a0 At points I was reminded of some of the most photographically stylized narrative features produced during Hollywood's postwar era, including \"My Darling Clementine\" and \"Moontide,\" which have much more in the way of a traditional \"story\" than this but seem similarly inclined to let things unfold in a figurative space, one that is seemingly disconnected from any timeline or map even though the characters mention actual places and actual dates as they speak. \u00a0 The rating at the top of this page is for originality and conviction, not for entertainment value, as if that phrase could mean anything when applied to such a gravely serious and mysterious movie. This is not a movie that comes to you. You have to go to it. There are long stretches of \"Horse Money\" in which you will have no idea what's going on or how the movie wants you to take it, if indeed it wants you take it in any particular way, and on the basis of Costa's past work, that seems unlikely. The best approach is to surrender to it as you might a dream and let the images overwhelm you. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Please Stand By", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "This movie begins with an evocation of space, with shots of a sci-fi desert and a voiceover describing characters we all know pretty well. Dakota Fanning, in the role of a woman we\u2019ll soon know as Wendy, is narrating a \u201cStar Trek\u201d adventure. Is there some copyright infringement issue here that we should know about? Not to worry, if you are the sort to worry about such things. Wendy, who has a form of autism and has to live apart from her sister, whose relatively newborn baby could fall victim to Wendy\u2019s inability to process anger properly, is a big \u201cStar Trek\u201d person. She\u2019s hell bent on completing an epic (500 pages total) \u201cTrek\u201d film script to submit to a Paramount Pictures-sponsored script-writing contest. (The idea of such a contest actually being sponsored by Paramount, incidentally, is more far-fetched than any \u201cStar Trek\u201d movie or episode; on the other hand, \u201cStar Trek\u201d fan organizations regularly have fan-fiction competitions and such.)    Advertisement The early portion of the movie sees Wendy struggling in various contexts\u2014with her therapist/caregiver, Scottie (good name!), who thinks she\u2019s making considerable progress; with sister Audrey, who\u2019s still more than a little scared of Wendy\u2019s sudden rages; and with her colleagues at the Cinnabon where Wendy works, tentatively. Soon the focus homes in on the script, and the plot turns on a single fact: having missed getting the script in the mail on Saturday, Wendy realizes \u201cThere\u2019s no mail pickup on Sunday, and Monday\u2019s a holiday\u201d and so she\u2019s going to miss the deadline for the submission. She\u2019s close enough to Los Angeles to take the bus, but given that Scottie and (implicitly) Audrey have forbidden her from crossing a particular street in their town, and she\u2019s been obeying that order since forever, she\u2019s pretty challenged in road-tripping. That being the case, many misfortunes befall Wendy, the first involving the small dog she was unable to prevent following her out her bedroom window at dawn. Mishaps involving thieves, insensitive civil servants, and other such types follow. \u201cPlease Stand By\u201d is a sensitive character study whose story beats are a little bit overly familiar, to be frank. Dakota Fanning is excellent as Wendy. The former child star has grown up to proportions that could be described as rangy, and Fanning in particularly uses her arms to convey the character\u2019s social awkwardness, often flailing them as if batting away unseen demons. Toni Collette is determinedly compassionate as Scottie, and Alice Eve (herself a \u201cStar Trek\u201d movie veteran) is confounded and sometimes helpless as Audrey. The movie becomes slightly more engaging in the final third, largely thanks to a brief turn by Patton Oswalt as a cop who has a unique insight into how to get the on-the-run Wendy to listen to him. The movie ends with an implausible but potentially crowd-pleasing scene of Wendy asserting herself in a more or less socially permissible way. Director Ben Lewin doesn\u2019t seem to bring any added value to Michael Golamco\u2019s script, but by letting the performers do their best stuff, he makes \u201cPlease Stand By\u201d palatable even in its most commonplace moments. \u00a0  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Discovery", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "The first scene of \"The Discovery\" shows the taping of an interview with Thomas Harbor (Robert Redford), a controversial reclusive scientist who has discovered undeniable proof of an afterlife. The reporter (Mary Steenburgen) attempts to get him to talk in-depth about his findings. The mood is tense. The interview ends abruptly with a sudden event that shocks all those present, stunning even Harbor who has seemed unflappable. The opening of the film instantly sets up a mood: uneasy, cagey, solemn. \"The Discovery,\" directed by Charlie McDowell, does not sustain that mood. The entire thing feels like it's happening underwater, sound distorted, movements impeded. A lot happens, but without any urgency inspiring it. Advertisement In the aftermath of Harbor's discovery, suicide rates spike to an all-time high. People check out in droves to get to the promised land on the other side. It's a plague-like crisis, and the world adjusts to its new normal, the news dominated by mass suicides, with suicide-counters hanging in public spaces. Jason Segal plays Will, one of Harbor's sons (Redford), who has serious reservations about his father's work. On a ferry ride out to the remote area where his father works, Will strikes up a conversation with the only other person on the boat, a prickly and aggressive woman with platinum hair named Isla (Rooney Mara). Their dialogue\u2014snippy, randomly aggressive, adversarial\u2014is written in a way that is clearly supposed to show potential romantic chemistry, but instead just feels irritated. Thomas Harbor has holed up in a fortress, the home of his mad-scientist laboratory and a devoted band of acolytes, all of whom tried to commit suicide before being drawn towards the light (i.e. Harbor's important work). The acolytes wear matching jumpsuits. Will confronts his pot-smoking brother Toby (Jesse Plemons) about the cultish atmosphere, but Toby brushes it off. Their father is doing great work, and Will needs to get on board. There are riveting elements here: the dynamic of the cult members, their submission to Harbor, the \"pep talks\" he holds, the guided meditations, the experiments in the lab. Riley Keough is very touching as one of the acolytes, a woman with an intensity and depth of feeling that makes her later scenes so frightening. There's not enough of Keough in \"The Discovery.\" The film spends most of its time trying to create a romance between Will and Isla, but they have so little chemistry it's hard to focus on what's happening between them. The characters remain indistinct, their connection ill-defined, muted. When they talk, their dialogue is clearly supposed to sound like \"banter,\" but it's forced. \"You're so annoying,\" exclaims Isla at one point. There\u2019s no subtext. The plot trudges on, with new revelations about the afterlife, Harbor's backstory, Will's backstory, and Isla's backstory, but it all unfolds in such a circuitous fashion that there's no sense of real forward motion. \"The Discovery\" has a lot of interesting ideas (mostly reminiscent of the 1990 film \"Flatliners\"), but the plot struggles to make any headway, as though it's trying to move through mud. Charlie McDowell's first feature was the thought-provoking \"The One I Love,\" written by Justin Lader (who also co-wrote \"The Discovery\" with McDowell). \"The One I Love\" tells the story of a couple (Mark Duplass and Elizabeth Moss) on a marriage retreat at an isolated location. Things get very weird. The overall atmosphere is one of psychological confusion, dissolved boundaries, fractured identity. It's frightening. Much of the mystery of the film remains intact. It's meant to destabilize one's sense of reality and certainty. \"The Discovery\" shares many of these elements, but it's a far more ambitious film, taking place on a grander scale. The strain shows.

{"Title": "Life on the Line", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "At the end of this movie, before the closing credits, a few screens\u2019 worth of text informs the viewer of the casualty rate of the electrical lineman over the past few years, and gives the name of a website whose mission \u201cis to memorialize fallen electrical line workers, and care for the families who have lost or are impacted by a severe injury of a loved one in the line of duty. We strive to consolidate accident and injury information to share openly for a safer work environment.\u201d Its web address is http://fallenlinemen.org and the site is well worth visiting. Advertisement I point this out now because I am obliged to assess the movie that preceded it. That movie does not, I think, do the job it intended, which was, I think, to make the lineman's work accessible to the viewer and to honor the courage and sacrifice of those who labor to keep the nation\u2019s electrical grid safe and operative. This is one of those \u201cbased on true events\u201d movies that give you the distinct feeling that the true events deserved better.  After introducing the framing device of an interview with a lineman played by Devon Sawa, the movie begins again with a prologue set in 1998 Texas, with John Travolta, in unconvincing young-age makeup, as Beau Ginner, a Texas lineman working in the middle of a lightning storm. He fails to rig some wires properly; his coworker, who\u2019s also his brother, chastises him, goes up the pole, and is soon killed after lightning hits a wire. His sister-in-law is killed in an auto accident rushing to the scene. Ginner is left with his memories, his job, and his young niece Bailey, who grows up to be played by Kate Bosworth, who also played the sister-in-law.  Experience has made Beau a safety maven, and sentiment has made Bailey a \u2018round the way girl who has the potential to go to college (one would think so, at age 33, although I guess Bosworth\u2019s playing younger) but prefers to work in a diner and be a townie\u2014which means being part of the lineman extended family. Here is where the narrative complications come in, and boy is director David Hackl not up for them. Here we go: Bailey has a sort-of ex-boyfriend named Duncan (that\u2019s Devon Sawa\u2019s character) who\u2019s a bit of a bad boy, motorcycle and all. (He\u2019s also got an alcoholic mom, a lineman widow, played by Sharon Stone in dampened \u201cCasino\u201d mode.) He\u2019s decided to straighten out, so he gets a job working the line, much to the chagrin of Beau. Then there\u2019s Ron (Matt Bellefleur), a creepy ex of Bailey\u2019s who\u2019s hanging around all sorts of places where he isn\u2019t welcome. Beau and Bailey also have new across-the-street neighbors, Ryan Robbins\u2019 Eugene, a lineman who\u2019s also an Iraq war veteran with PTSD, and his wife Carline (Julie Benz), who\u2019s good-hearted and loyal up to a point, and who picks the wrong way to balk at Eugene\u2019s neglect and borderline abuse. As a major storm approaches their town\u2014you know this because every other scene or so a title comes up saying \u201c[X] Days Before THE STORM,\u201d with graphics like some cable news special or something\u2014the characters abrade each other in various ways, Bailey reveals a secret, and something\u2019s gotta give. In case you missed it, it\u2019s pretty clear that the storm is gonna make everything and more do that giving. These plot lines aren\u2019t simple, but they\u2019re not exactly convoluted either. Frequently while watching \u201cLife on the Line\u201d I thought how much better they\u2019d be handled\u2014straight and clean and without fuss\u2014in a 1930s or 40s working-man\u2019s melodrama from Warner Brothers, maybe one by a director along the lines of Raoul Walsh. He made one of the great men-in-a-dangerous-profession pictures, 1940\u2019s \u201cThey Drive By Night,\u201d about truck drivers. But \u201cLife on the Line\u201d muddles them hopelessly, first by way of its myriad and busy structural devices, and then by inserting flashbacks that have all the logic of hiccups, and then, finally, by overplaying its melodramatic hand.  Advertisement To John Travolta\u2019s credit, he doesn\u2019t phone in what could have been an indifferent role. His accent gets a little broad at times, but he\u2019s sincere and conscientious in his portrayal of a working man who doesn\u2019t want to be a hero, but will if he has to be. Sawa is better than okay too, as is Gil Bellows; only Bellefleur strays into egregious ham territory. The themes and the actors make you want the movie to be better, but the overreach combined with the sloppy sensationalism of the suspense scenes make \u201cLife on the Line\u201d the wrong kind of cinematic ordeal.", "Critic": "Gamma"}

I myself was kind of curious as to how, at a time when it\r\nseems so many of the best film directors are moving over to television because\r\nthe feature filmmaking process can\u2019t accommodate their artistic ambitions, this\r\npompous, know-something-ish, navel-gazing, indulgent, pissy, priggish, albeit\r\nreasonably well-photographed, pile of sick got financed to completion. Because\r\n\"Among Ravens\" is, finally, a thoroughly noxious concoction.  \u201cRavens were once among the most colorful of birds,\u201d begins\r\nthe narration from the young girl Joey (Johnny Sequoyah, the best performer in\r\nthe movie). Joey sees her extended family as raven-like. Her biological dad, a\r\nbest-selling author named Saul King, who refers to himself as \u201cThe King,\u201d lists\r\n\u201cAn Unkindness of Ravens\u201d as among his tomes. So the metaphors, you see, start\r\nhitting right off the bat, as the movie introduces a schlubby life-coach\r\ncharacter (Calum Grant)\u00a0 and his\r\nsuper-post-hippie-dippie teen girlfriend (Castille Landon, playing a terribly\r\nunappealing variant on the Meg Tilly character in \"The Big Chill\"), Joey\u2019s\r\nconflicted-about-being-bourgeois mom Wendy (Amy Smart), Wendy\u2019s\r\nstrapped-for-income but not-wanting-to-show it husband Ellis (Joshua Leonard),\r\nall bantering and trading success stories until oddball Chad (Will McCormack)\r\ncomes along.\u00a0The\r\nstranger-who-upends-the-lives-of-complacent-characters trope is one with long\r\ncinematic history, and as soon as you get a long look at McCormack\u2019s goofy mug\r\nyou hope this isn\u2019t going to be a \"Teorema\"-style seducing scenario.

{"Title": "In Stereo", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "Film scripts make many mistakes that are easily survivable if you have talented actors and fluid direction. But a script that features low-stakes conflict is difficult to survive, especially if the film doesn't have those other elements working in its favor. Mel Rodriguez III\u2019s \"In Stereo,\" a \"romantic\" \"comedy\" (quotations required for both words) is one of the lowest-stakes movies in recent memory, and the worst part is that it thinks that it is a high-stakes movie. It also thinks these characters have \"relatable\" problems. They don't. The main problem they share is that their personalities stink and they don't know it. Rodriguez, who wrote the script, doesn't seem to know it either. Advertisement \n David (Micah Hauptman) is a fortunate and gifted photographer who is successful enough to have his own show coming up in an enormous gallery but still spends his time feeling put-upon and wronged. Exactly what he photographs is unclear, but when the movie begins, David is a rage-boy, provoking people (strangers, his girlfriend, cops) and then taking pictures of their reactions just before they punch him out or flip him off. He always has a split lip or a black eye. He is an angry, vicious little man, and he is the hero of our story.  In the film's opener, he kicks his ex-girlfriend Brenda (Beau Garrett) to the curb when she suggests they move in together. Not even a year later he has moved in with a rebound girl named Jen (Melissa Bolona), a gorgeous nonentity with resting bitchface whom he suspects is cheating with his best friend Chris (Kieran Campion). The fact that David is a terrible boyfriend, un-giving and cold, may have something to do with her infidelity, but \"In Stereo\" gangs up on Jen, demonizing her in scene after scene, even though she's selfish but ultimately no worse than the rest of them. Chris, the best friend, is a gloomy Byronic gadabout, bored with everything, even sex with hot women. He does nothing with his life because his family is rich.\u00a0 \n David decides to live his life \"in stereo,\" which means following Jen through the streets and subways, taking surreptitious photographs of her, and obsessing on what she does when she is not with him. In voice-over, he tells us that his uncle was a private investigator who gave him advice: when you follow people, the key is to know where they are going and to get there first. (This concept is lifted, almost word for word, from the far more effective \"Zero Effect.\") Meanwhile, we catch up with Brenda, an actress, who is so unpleasant to work with that she just got fired from a reality-TV hostess job for being rude to the show runner and who rolls her eyes at other students' work in her acting class, even taking phone calls during someone else's monologue. When Chris tells her later in the film that she is like a \"ray of moonlight\" in a chaotic world, you assume he hasn't seen how she treats waiters. Advertisement \n But the filmmaker seems to believe that he has created a \"ray of moonlight\" in Brenda, and that David is an interesting character, troubled and lost and therefore somewhat sympathetic. He's not. He's a bully, emotionally and otherwise. He starts trouble with strangers, one encounter having an unpleasant homophobic quality, and then takes pictures of the people freaking out. He's a troll. He is also in therapy, but he does nothing in therapy except complain and prop up his own aggrieved and righteous sense of himself.  What David wants is a low-stakes life and, ultimately, that is the main issue, because in real life, things matter to people. Who you fall in love with matters. Your career matters. Your friendships matter. In \"In Stereo\" nothing really matters. David doesn't even seem to like Jen. He just uses her as a punching bag for his rage and entitlement. \"In Stereo\" doesn't realize that the problem is not Jen, but David.\u00a0 \n \n When Tommy Lee Jones appeared on \"Inside the Actor's Studio,\" he was asked about playing murderer Gary Gilmore, and whether or not an actor had to like the character he was playing. Jones' response was typically blunt: \"No. But I think you have to want to watch the character.\" Films don't have to feature likable people to be successful. Far from it. But a film has to let us know why we want to watch these people. Like its lead character, \"In Stereo\" does not want to do the necessary work.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Burying the Ex", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Nobody doubts that director Joe Dante, the eye and\r\nsensibility behind \u201cThe Howling,\u201d \u201cGremlins,\u201d \u201cInnerspace,\u201d and more, is a\r\ngenre master, a guy who can blend gory horror with mordant comedy with apparent\r\nease, who can bring a true Looney Tunes feel to live-action sci-fi and fantasy,\r\nand more. Even masters have their off days, however, and Dante\u2019s new picture,\r\n\u201cBurying The Ex,\u201d seems to have been made over the course of quite a few of\r\nthem. Scripted and co-produced by Alan Trezza, and admittedly shot on the cheap\r\nover what must have been a very punishing 20-day shoot, the picture has\r\nintermittent charm and very little flair. Its eagerness to ingratiate long-time\r\nhorror fans, what with its multiple references to obscure films and nods to\r\nspecialist publications such as Video Watchdog (and yes I am a proud\r\nsubscriber), actually gets a little irritating after a while.

His rather\r\nimprobable girlfriend Evelyn (Ashley Greene) is a prim (in every respect except\r\nsex-wise, which trait I guess is meant to register as \u201cquirky\u201d) eco-warrior who\r\nhas little patience for Max\u2019s enthusiasms or his ultra-loutish half-brother\r\nTravis. The whole Max-Travis dynamic is reminiscent of the male relationships\r\nin early Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg scripts such as \u201cSuperbad,\u201d only those works\r\nhad good jokes. Trezza\u2019s script teems with clumsy lines such as \u201cJust let me\r\nfinish up this blog\u201d (the character means \u201cblog post\u201d) and \u201cThat was\r\nfangtastic.\u201d And the Max/Evelyn relationship is reminiscent of \u201cKnocked Up,\u201d I\r\nguess, because the couple only ever has Bra Sex. Evelyn moves in and takes down\r\nall of Max\u2019s cherry Italian horror movie posters, while a local ice-cream shop\r\ngives Max a taste of alternate dating reality in the form of horror-movie\r\nloving Olivia (Alexandra Daddario). Also: a talisman at Max\u2019s shop puts,\r\napparently, some form of curse on Evelyn. So that when she\u2019s killed in a street\r\naccident, she doesn\u2019t stay dead. Hence the title.  Zombie Evelyn isn\u2019t like other zombies: she\u2019s fully\r\nfunctional, brain-wise, and weirdly for Max, just as frisky as she was when she\r\nhad a beating heart. She doesn\u2019t even look that bad\u2014not falling-off body parts,\r\nsome bruising around the face and neck and a generally hollowed-out thing going\r\non. \u201cYour girlfriend is so Goth,\u201d Olivia says to Max, not suspecting the\r\nbizarre love triangle she\u2019s walking into. That last line is about as close to a\r\ngood one-liner as the movie offers up, by the way. As for the zombie stuff,\r\nit\u2019s even less convincing and engaging as I\u2019m making it sound. I know that\r\nhorror movies, or horror comedies, aren\u2019t for people who like their film\r\nscenarios plausible, but \u201cBurying The Ex\u201d offers such a watered-down and\r\ninternally inconsistent idea of zombiedom that it makes any kind of willing\r\nsuspension of disbelief well nigh impossible. The material proves, I fear,\r\nintractable for director Dante, who shows a little verve in the last third,\r\nintercutting a new-love sequence with a bit of human-organ-eating on\r\nabandoned-for-the-evening Zombie Evelyn\u2019s part. Different strokes, as they say.\r\nPotentially tautological as this may seem I\u2019m not even sure I can, with good\r\nconscience, call this a film for Dante completists only.

{"Title": "Bessie", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "HBO\u2019s \u201cBessie,\u201d premiering Saturday on the network, is a\r\nflawed drama that nonetheless warrants a look simply because of the bright\r\nspotlight it gives the underrated talents of star Queen Latifah, who does quite\r\neasily the best work of her career here. This sexually-charged, intense look at\r\nBlues icon Bessie Smith often feels defiantly episodic, as if\r\nco-writer/director Dee Rees is purposefully trying to sketch a portrait of a\r\nlife in incomplete brush strokes, but Latifah, who is in nearly every scene,\r\nnever falters in her portrayal of a woman who was too edgy, too real, and too\r\ntough to be famous before the world came crashing down around her.  Advertisement In the first full scene of \u201cBessie,\u201d the title character\r\n(Queen Latifah) is getting hot and heavy in an alley when her paramour goes a grope\r\ntoo far and starts to get violent when she refuses. She does not give in, grabbing\r\na glass shard off the pavement and stabbing her attacker, before going on stage\r\nto sing a number. Bessie takes no shit from anyone. Even those who would offer\r\nher good advice or further her career are often pushed aside by pride and ego\r\nas much as artistic integrity. Across most of \u201cBessie,\u201d we see the title\r\ncharacter confronting authority, patriarchy, the white male establishment, etc.\r\nShe is presented with an opportunity to find a broader audience but compromise\u2014she\r\nrefuses. She encounters a violent KKK sect trying to shut down a performance\u2014she\r\nmeets violence with violence. In one great moment, Langston Hughes warns her to\r\n\u201cplay\u201d to her white, snooty crowd before she heads into a party to perform. She\r\nshoots him down with a glance. Bessie Smith was a vaudeville smash in the 1920s, successful\r\nenough to have her own train on which she toured the country, and to inspire\r\nNina Simone and Billie Holliday. She rose to fame purely through talent and\r\nsheer will, but demons like addiction and the ceiling she eventually hit by\r\nrefusing to bend to the will of white producers kept her out of the spotlight,\r\nand even sunk her so low that her family was threatened. \u201cBessie\u201d hides none of\r\nSmith\u2019s demons or resilience. Reportedly in the making for 22 years from a\r\nscript by Horton Foote, it\u2019s easy to see why \u201cBessie\u201d was a film inevitability.\r\nThis is a great story of a relatively unheralded talent.  And everyone involved should be grateful that Queen Latifah\r\nagreed to take on this challenging role, one that she had reportedly been\r\ncircling for over a decade. She is powerful, fearless, and, when needed,\r\nvulnerable in a role that could easily win her an Emmy and a Golden Globe.\r\nCriticisms of \u201cBessie\u201d fall away when this performance is considered,\r\nespecially when one balances the emotional intensity of the final act with the\r\nbravado of the first two. Bessie never feels like a dramatic creation; she\r\nresonates with truth, whether it be in the longing that led her to multiple\r\naffairs (including ones with characters played by Mike Epps and Tika Sumpter),\r\nor in her downright allergic reactions to what she saw as fakeness in her profession.\r\nBlues legend Ma Rainey (Mo\u2019Nique) tells Smith early on, \u201cYou got to put something else in it. The blues is not about people\r\nknowing you, it\u2019s about you knowing people.\u201d Queen Latifah really got to\r\nknow Bessie Smith in ways that other actresses couldn\u2019t have.  Advertisement Sometimes scripts that have been around as long as \u201cBessie\u201d\r\nget over-worked, over-edited, over-analyzed to the point that they lose some of\r\nthat screenwriting \u201cmagic.\u201d The first half of \u201cBessie\u201d feels a bit too\r\ncalculated, too episodic in a way designed to give Latifah and her co-stars\r\n(including the great Michael K. Williams) the right number of big moments\r\nwithout linking them together in the arc of a life. And regular TV cinematographer Jeffrey Jur shoots too much of the film like a TV movie. It doesn't have the cinematic scope or visual language I wish it did outside of the musical numbers. As for storytelling, I found myself too often asking, especially in the first half, \"What are we supposed\r\nto take away from this story?\" Maybe nothing. Maybe we're just supposed to know more about an underrated musical icon. For that reason, \u201cBessie\u201d is best appreciated as a character/performance\r\npiece.

{"Title": "A Most Wanted Man", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Anton Corbijn\u2019s \u201cA Most Wanted Man\u201d has an added and perhaps\r\nunwanted gravity by virtue of forever bearing the title of \u201cThe Last Leading\r\nRole of Philip Seymour Hoffman.\u201d Watching one of the great American actors embody his final leading man gives the entire piece the air of a haunting, particularly\r\nbecause PSH\u2019s character is such a world-weary, melancholic guy, someone who\r\nseems to be out of time and patience. It has been difficult to sever the truth\r\nof cinema\u2019s loss from his characters when watching Hoffman\u2019s work since his\r\npassing but this is the only time in which it feels like his tragic death has\r\nactually changed the final product (it was somehow easier to get past in \"God\u2019s\r\nPocket,\" the \"Capote\" screening at Ebertfest and I imagine it will be in \"Mockingjay\"\r\nlater this year). Corbijn keeps the action of \"A Most Wanted Man\" at arms length or greater, never finding the heart of the piece despite mostly solid performances and strong production values. He allows us to stay disengaged from the narrative itself and to be\r\ndistracted by how much the movie world has lost. Advertisement Hoffman plays Gunther Bachmann, a man trapped in bureaucracy and shackled by a government that doesn\u2019t give him the trust or\r\ntools he needs to do his job. Bachmann is an intelligence expert in Hamburg,\r\nGermany, a place that will never be the same in terms of espionage because it\r\nserved as the home base for the 9/11 hijackers. How did the entire intelligence\r\ncommunity there not see that coming? Since that fateful day, Bachmann and his\r\nteam (which includes Daniel Bruhl and Nina Hoss) have been forced to work on an\r\never-shifting landscape. The government wants to hammer down on any nail that\r\nlooks out of place but Bachmann knows that it\u2019s the long, patient game that\r\nreaps the biggest rewards in the world of espionage. Bachmann stumbles upon one of the biggest cases of his\r\ncareer when a Russian man named Issa Karpov (Grigoriy Dobrygin) arrives in\r\nHamburg, seeking asylum and his notoriously evil father\u2019s massive fortune. Issa\r\nis a half-Chechen, half-Russian Muslim, a title that raises every possible red\r\nflag in the eyes of Bachmann\u2019s team and those above him. Bachmann\u2019s superiors\r\nwant to grab Issa immediately. Bachmann knows that finding out\u00a0why Issa arrived in Hamburg is more important than just capturing him. So\r\nthe follow game begins.  Issa tracks down a banker (the always-effective Willem Dafoe), seeking his father\u2019s\r\ndirty money. He also forms a friendship with a human rights activist named\r\nAnnabel Richter played hollowly by Rachel McAdams, who ends up an important cog\r\nin Le Carre\u2019s machine, as do a CIA operative played by Robin Wright and a\r\nsuspicious Muslim leader played by Homayoun Ershadi. As in \"Tinker Tailor\r\nSoldier Spy\" and \"The Constant Gardener,\" everyone has a role to play in the\r\nspy game. And it\u2019s remarkable how much tension Le Carre can draw without\r\nmuch violence or traditional action at all. In \"A Most Wanted Man,\" every\r\ndecision, every admittance, every secret revealed or held can collapse the\r\nhouse of cards that Bachmann needs to stay upright to stop another 9/11. It is\r\na vision of the spy game as one of neverending frustrations and roadblocks. Advertisement It is also a cold, distant film; more than it needed to be. \u201cConstant\r\nGardner\u201d and \u201cTinker Tailor\u201d drew audiences into their complex world through\r\ntheir relatable characters, mostly the pair played so expertly by Rachel Weisz\r\nand Gary Oldman, respectively, but Corbijn offers no such channel into \u201cA Most Wanted Man.\u201d\r\nThere are glimpses of humanity in Hoffman\u2019s staccato German-accented delivery\r\nbut the problem comes in the dynamic between Annabel and Issa. This should be\r\nthe heat and emotion of the film, balanced against the cold visual palette that\r\nCorbijn and his team have chosen for the rest of it. Amidst the metal of\r\nsurveillance fans and glass windows of conference rooms in which life and death\r\ndecisions are being made, there is a tortured, broken soul of a Muslim/Chechen\r\nyoung man looking for anything human to latch on to. Sadly, Corbijn doesn\u2019t seem\r\ninterested enough in the characters of Issa and Annabel, making both of them\r\nmere plot devices. Anton Corbijn is a detailed, precise filmmaker, a fact that\r\nbrought a fascinating level of detail to the underrated \"The American.\" Here, his\r\nprecision plays up Le Carre\u2019s hopelessness in a spy game that one knows will\r\nnever work out the right way for all parties involved. In today\u2019s world of\r\nespionage, someone is always going to lose. It's far from a complete failure but the flaws of \u201cA Most Wanted Man\u201d remind us not of how much humanity\r\nand hope we\u2019ve lost internationally since 9/11 but how much we\u2019ve lost by saying\r\ngoodbye to an incredible actor.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "3 1/2 Minutes, Ten Bullets", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "On Friday, November 23, 2012, around 7:30 p.m., a Jacksonville, Florida gas station erupted with gunfire. When the smoke cleared, 17-year old Jordan Davis was dead of gunshot wounds, and the car in which he and his friends had been traveling was riddled with bullet holes. \"3 1/2 Minutes, Ten Bullets\" is an account of the event and its legal and racial implications. It's told in a contemplative style that brings the story's emotions to life without hyping them. The shooter was Michael Dunn, 45 and white. Davis and his friends\u2014Leland Brunson, Tommie Stornes, and Tevin Thompson\u2014were teenage and black. The altercation started when Dunn and his girlfriend, Rhonda Rouer, stopped at a gas station. They pulled into a parking spot adjacent to the teenagers, who were blasting rap music. Tommie Stornes was already in the store buying gum and cigarettes. Rouer entered the gas station's convenience store for white wine and chips. On her way inside, she heard Dunn complain about the teenagers' \"thug music\"\u2014Dunn later insisted he hadn't used that word, but had instead called the music \"rap crap.\" Dunn then asked the teenagers to turn it down. Thompson complied, but then Davis told him to turn the music back up. Dunn said Davis threatened to kill him, opened his car door and pointed what Dunn thought was a shotgun, and Dunn opened fire. But police who searched the vehicle found no evidence of any kind of weapon. Rouer later said that Dunn didn't say anything to her about a gun until a day later, though Dunn insists he described it to her repeatedly.  Advertisement Dunn was ultimately convicted of first-degree murder in fall, 2014. An earlier 2014 proceeding found Dunn guilty of second degree murder for shooting at the other teenagers in the car, but jurors could not agree on the first-degree murder charge for killing Davis. Dunn's legal team invoked Florida's \"Stand Your Ground\" law, which allows for the possibility of legally killing another person that the killer believes might pose a lethal threat. Davis' parents have subsequently called for a repeal of that law as well as tighter restrictions on guns.  This all adds up to as explosive a documentary topic as you'll ever see.The violence originates in multi-layered resentment\u2014racial, cultural and generational\u2014with \"Stand Your Ground,\" gun control and machismo stirred into the mix.  Luckily, Marc Silver and his collaborators avoid anything that might seem inflammatory. They explore the case in empathetic, detached images that are carefully composed, and often beautiful in a sad way, and mostly resist the urge to treat people's suffering as a thing to be photographed. Shots of towering trees, knotted highways and urban southern panoramas squashed beneath blue-grey cloud banks contribute to a sense of spiritual torment. The documentary favors Davis' side of the story, partly because \r\nJordan's parents gave the filmmakers access to their lives and stories, \r\nwhile Dunn, his girlfriend and his family apparently didn't. (They're represented in the\r\n film mainly through courtroom shots of them testifying and \r\nlistening to others' testimony.)\u00a0  But mostly the movie appears to side with Davis' parents because Dunn's story is full of contradictions and holes. He comes off seeming like very bad news even though Silver omits or glosses over details that might have made him even more unsympathetic, such as the fact that he and Rouer left the gas station where Dunn had shot a stranger to death without reporting the incident to the police, then went back to their motel and ordered a pizza.  Advertisement It's often said that when you're presented with conflicting accounts of \r\nan event, the one that seems most plausible is probably correct. The movie\r\n seems to align itself with that sentiment. There is nothing in the pasts of Davis or his friends to suggest that they would have had a shotgun in the car, which makes Dunn's insistence that he saw one seem like racist paranoia\u2014an excuse to act out a homicidal fantasy that he might've been nursing for years before pulling into that parking spot. The film goes into some detail about how, to quote one of Davis's friends, \"'thug' is the new 'n-word,'\" and establishes Dunn as a man with anger management issues that\u00a0 overshadowed his likable qualities.  The most damning testimony, though, comes from Rouer. She could easily have taken Dunn's side and told authorities that she saw Jordan open the car door and pull a shotgun on her boyfriend (actions that nobody else at the gas station saw), but she says she saw nothing of the kind, and disputes other key points of his account as well, including his insistence that he never used the word \"thug\" to describe the teenagers' music. Dunn told authorities that the following morning he called a friend in \r\nlaw enforcement to arrange to talk to police, but Rouer later said that\r\n the friend called Dunn, not the other way around, and the two men \r\ndidn't talk about the shooting. There are no heroes in this story, but Rouer nearly qualifies. She sided with strangers over her own boyfriend because she thought it was the right thing to do, and when she breaks down on the witness stand, you can see how much the decision cost her. It all adds up to a portrait of a man who knows he's done something inexcusably awful and can't face the consequences. Police interrogation room footage and recorded phone calls contribute to the feeling that Dunn was disconnected from the murder, and cared mainly about his own fate. He's eerily dry and \"rational,\" at times lighthearted, when he discusses the shooting with a detective after the event; he talks out various scenarios as if describing a fender-bender. There are moments in the audio where Dunn seems to be as callous and self-serving as his detractors claim, including a bit where he compares himself to \"the rape girl that was attacked for wearing skimpy clothes.\" Advertisement Silver's documentary occasionally suffers from lack of focus and clarity. There are times when the dreamy mood derails the narrative, and makes it seem as though the film is being swallowed by sadness over the events it's chronicling. And while the movie's determination to let us find our way through the story is laudable, onscreen titles might have helped establish where we are, and whom and what we're looking at. You don't learn the names of any of the supporting players (including the lawyers) until somebody says them out loud, and unless you're paying close attention to every word of the TV news stories that Silver samples, you might not know what month or year you're in, much less which courtroom trial you're looking at.  There are also moments where you might wish that the mostly superb editing had found a way to shape the events more precisely, to pose questions that the film never asks in so many words, even though it seems to want to. Would a thorough mental-health screening process for gun licenses have prevented Dunn from carrying a handgun? Did anybody ask Dunn why he didn't immediately turn himself in after killing a stranger?  Was Davis' angry response to Dunn's request that he turn the music down culturally \"general\"\u2014a teenage black man/middle-aged white man/rap thing thing\u2014or was it rooted in specific incidents from Jordan's life? (One of Davis' friends says Jordan said he was tired of people telling him what to do, but this isn't followed up.)\u00a0 These are not deal-breaking flaws, though.  \"3 1/2 Minutes, Ten Bullets\" doesn't move or look like most documentaries you've seen. The movie's meditative quality makes you feel for everyone involved in this tragedy\u2014even Dunn, who seems very much a prisoner of fear and anger. Where a lot of documentaries would try to stir outrage, this one just leaves you shaking your head. The numb feeling comes from the knowledge that what we're seeing onscreen\u2014the racial and generational animosity, the normalization of gun violence, the checklist of reasons why nothing can be done\u2014are just pieces of one more American day.

{"Title": "Danny Collins", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"Danny Collins,\" about an old pop star discovering the true meaning of life, is an appealing comedy with an unabashed streak of melodrama, sharp dialogue, and a superb ensemble cast, anchored by a lead performance by Al Pacino in lovable scamp mode. Its excitement comes from watching its leathery, raspy-voiced star play the title character, a Neil Diamond-ish soft rock icon reconnecting with the family he's neglected for decades while wooing a Hilton manager named Mary Sinclair (Annette Bening) and trying to write something new and good. Advertisement If this sounds like a tidy arc, well, it is\u2014but only for Danny, and only at first. Written and directed by first-time feature filmmaker Dan Fogelman (\"Crazy Stupid Love,\" \"Tangled\"), the movie is a redemption tale in which a man who has long thought of nothing but money and pleasure experiences a series of emotional shocks, contemplates his life and image, and struggles to become a better man and a deeper artist. From the second we meet Danny, we think of him as a charismatic buffoon, a guy who'd probably be insufferable if he weren't aware of how little new material he's written during the last three decades of his career,  how few relationships he's forged of any depth, and how much money he's blown through (a lot of it went straight up his nose).  When Danny's manager and best friend Frank (the great Christopher Plummer) gives Danny a birthday gift\u2014a 1971 fan letter from John Lennon inviting him to come to New York and look him and Yoko up\u2014we expect the shakeup to put him on a straight line towards sainthood. After a few sleepless nights, Danny cancels his big-money tour, breaks off his engagement to a younger woman who's been cheating on him, checks into a suburban New Jersey Hilton, and sets about wooing Mary, working on a vaguely Leonard Cohen-esque confessional song, and reconnecting with his long-estranged son, Tom Donnelly (Bobby Cannavale), a real working-class hero (as per Lennon's hit) who lives in the suburbs with his pregnant wife Samantha (Jennifer Garner) and their special-needs daughter, Hope (Giselle Eisenberg). The dialogue and story details are often a bit much (did Danny's granddaughter have to be named Hope, and did the film have to use Lennon's music as emotional boldface?) and after a while, the film's meandering rhythm can seem too pleased with itself. But this is still a hugely effective film, mainly because the path between Danny and redemption proves steeper than he dreamed, and it's filled with obstructions, some placed by acts of God, others by Danny's personality and world view (and addictions\u2014not just to drugs and alcohol but to luxury).\u00a0 And this is what sets \"Danny Collins\" above other films of its type: its awareness of the gap between the narratives we fantasize for ourselves and the ones we live out. Although we have no cause to doubt the legitimacy of Danny's existential crisis, Pacino and his director never indulge in special pleading on his behalf; in fact they go the other way, driving home how Danny's self-improvement regimen is mostly smoke and mirrors. There's a touch of Royal Tenenbaum to the way he waltzes back into his son's life and affects a man-of-the-people vibe. It's possible for an arrogant S.O.B. to be forgiven, but it's not a matter of flipping a switch.  Advertisement The entire film could be a feature-length elaboration of the classic confession booth scene in \"Salvador,\" in which a boozing, whoring, drug-addled man promises to give up all vices in exchange for salvation, then instantly begins carving exemptions for himself. Danny's resolutions to quit snorting coke, cut back on his drinking, win the love of his son and his family, write great new material, and live a less ostentatiously empty life all seem absurd when you realize how big the challenges are, and how much effort he actually invests in achieving his goals. (\"I'm not runnin' for Pope!\" he protests.) Plus, even when Danny's at his most abashed and thoughtful, he's still a ludicrous figure, shoehorning a baby grand piano into his hotel room; zipping around in a gull-winged sports car or a tour bus with black leather couches and leopard-and-zebra print pillows; trying to buy his family's love with day trips and shopping sprees, and strutting through a suburban Hilton in pimp suits, Cuban heeled boots and Robert Evans glasses. (Only Frank can penetrate the shellac of his ego, maybe because he's the only character old enough to call Danny \"Kid.\") The film invites us to laugh at Danny's delusions while bearing in mind that it is, on various levels, the story of an addict inching towards recovery while backsliding. Pacino's vanity-free performance centers the film in reality even when it's flirting with \"Annie\"-style wealth porn or edging towards three-hanky-weeper territory. When Danny invites Mary, a witty and enticing but skeptical career woman, to spend the night in his suite, he reassures her that he's so old there isn't even a possibility of sex, and when Frank notes that Danny's new flame is \"age appropriate,\" Danny self-deprecatingly corrects him: \"Not really....baby steps!\" The script is more empathetic than withering, mocking the species instead of skewering individuals.  Better yet, not only are most of Danny's victories small, he seems aware of how small they are, yet grateful to have each one. The character lived much of his adult life at a level where no one could tell him anything (except Frank, and only sometimes). Now, suddenly, has he has to really listen to people and give a damn about their feelings. This proves critically important in his relationship with Tom, a strong and kind but understandably bitter adult son who refuses to give an inch, with good reason. (Cannavale is heroically moving here, playing a troubled but radiantly decent man.) It's not until fairly late in \"Danny Collins\" that you realize the redemption arc is a red herring. The film is less about the likelihood of people changing their essence than the necessity of accepting people's flaws along with their virtues, and making space in your life for anyone who has a good heart and is worth the trouble.\u00a0   Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Neruda", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The Chilean director Pablo Larrain gives the impression of aspiring to intellectual curiosity, political engagement, and committed anti-triviality. What a person aspires to and what he or she actually achieve are frequently extremely different things. I\u2019ve seen three of Larrain\u2019s features so far\u2014\u201cNo,\u201d \u201cThe Club,\u201d and this one, about the Chilean poet and political figure\u2014and the only thing I can say about him with near-absolute (subjective) certainty is that he\u2019s a persistently humorless filmmaker. Andrew Sarris had a category for guys like this: \u201cStrained Seriousness.\u201d Advertisement \u201cNeruda,\u201d directed by Larrain from a script by Guillermo Calder\u00f3n, begins in Chile just after World War II, and shows its title subject, a portly, bald-pated man who is not just a celebrated poet but also a Senator, enjoying all the perks of both positions. In the gigantic men\u2019s lavatory of\u00a0 the Senate building, he waxes pedantic to his colleagues. In his spacious house he hosts orgiastic costume parties; he dresses up as T.E. Lawrence at one. When asked to recite, he goes to a default verse, a famous one. As he performs grandiose and shallow postures, another presence makes itself known. In voiceover, an unseen enemy speaks of Neruda and his confreres: \u201cThey do not know what it is to sleep on the floor, but they are all red.\u201d The railing against the Limousine Left is coming from a police detective named \u00d3scar Peluchonneau, an anti-Communist whose sneers at Neruda and his kind will help fuel him once he\u2019s assigned to arrest the poet after a government shakeup that turns circumstances against Neruda and his fellow Communists.  The portrait of Neruda that continues is very different from the kindly poet depicted in the once-popular film fable \u201cIl Postino;\u201d this movie gives Neruda his teeth back, while at the same time lording it over him. Seemingly obliged to seek exile even as he aches to speak on behalf of his country\u2019s oppressed, he vacillates between bravery and peculiar cupidity. As he flees Peluchonneau\u2019s dogged pursuit, he baits the policeman, sending him genre novels and making his varied escapes in a deliberate nick-of-time fashion. Once Peluchonneau catches up with Neruda\u2019s wife, Delia, the woman has a surprise for him. Peluchonneau is not real, she tells him; he is a \u201csupporting character\u201d created by Neruda himself, to make the story of Neruda\u2019s escape from Chile that much more thrilling. This revelation throws the detective for a loop, to say the least.  And the movie itself takes Delia at her word, depicting Peluchonneau\u2019s mission in ever more melodramatic movie-movie fashion, depicting him goggled, riding in a motorcycle sidecar with bad mountainous-landscape rear-projection imagery behind him (shades of Guy Maddin). Larrain has cited the Argentinean fabulist Jorge Luis Borges as an influence, but this isn\u2019t really Borges\u2019 style of meta; and in any event a character becoming aware of his own fictional status goes back to Lewis Carroll if not farther.  The point of it all being that history and poetry are not possible without personified antimonies, real or imagined. \u201cNeruda\u201d does not make this point in any particularly convincing way, despite excellent performances by Luis Gnecco as the title character, a stolid Gael Garcia Bernal as his pursuer, and Mercedes Mor\u00e1n as Delia. \u201cNeruda\u201d is, like all the Larrain films I\u2019ve seen, laudable in its ambitions and ultimately unsatisfying in its execution.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Black Sea", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Peanut butter and chocolate. Fish and chips. The heist movie and the submarine picture.\u00a0These things go together so perfectly that it's a wonder they were ever apart.\u00a0 \"Black Sea\" combines its two genres with such enthusiasm that although the gears don't mesh perfectly and some of the story beats are predictable, the result is so altogether pleasurable that I can't imagine fans of either genre failing to enjoy it.\u00a0Directed by Kevin MacDonald (\"The Last King of Scotland\") from an original script by playwright Dennis Kelly, it's about a laid-off English submarine captain (Jude Law) who gets lured by a shady company into assembling a crack team of nautical misfits to board a refurbished Soviet sub, dive to the bottom of the Black Sea, and loot a wrecked U-boat full of Nazi gold. Advertisement Like most submarine films, this is a pressure-cooker story about what happens when already-tense men pile into a glorified tin can and spend a few weeks underwater. And like most heist pictures, it's about a group of people who are drawn together by a common cause (personal enrichment\u2014or if you prefer, greed), then splinter into factions during crises and start acting from insecurity, egotism, and fear. You could retitle the film \"Under the Ocean's 11\" if it weren't stocked with such misbegotten, miserable people.\u00a0 Law's character, Robinson, is not your typical iron-jawed Navy hunk. He's more of a working-class hero type, as bitterly angry about his lot in life as the protagonist of a 1950s kitchen sink drama. When the story begins, he's looking for redemption after losing his wife and child to, well, the sea; he spent the better part of 30 years in submarines, returning home only occasionally, and finally his spouse decided she'd had it. Now Robinson has nothing from his marriage but flashbacks to a beach vacation. Robinson's half-English, half-Russian crew are variations on his type: guys who don't fit into life on land, see themselves as martyrs to dog-eat-dog capitalism, and treat the mission as a Hail Mary pass at re-creation. They've all either been phased out of the new economy or never fit into it in the first place, due to personal flaws (alcoholism, socipathy, a tendency to take a wrench to the skull of anyone who crosses them, that kind of thing). And now they're all in the same boat, so to speak, risking everything for One Last Big Score.\u00a0The film wears its allegorical/political aspirations on its grimy sleeve, but these tend to enliven rather than deaden the action, because they remind you of what the mission means to everyone. This is especially helpful when things start going from challenging to hellish. Robinson's motivational rants against robber-barons might've been delivered on a soapbox in a town square in about 1926, but damned if they don't do the trick. Advertisement Robinson is a strong leader, but only if you define strength as a mix of scary intensity and a knack for pushing other people's buttons. His sailors are basically an assortment of giant, walking buttons, and as Robison hammers on them, they hammer on each other. The Russians (Grigory Dobrygin, Konstantin Khabensky, Sergey Seksler, Sergey Klesnikov, Sergey Puskepalis) are all stereotypically grim, taciturn Slavic types, many of whom have been outfitted with Perfect Storms of facial hair; the way MacDonald frames and lights them, etching their faces in desiccated shades of red, ochre and sea-foam green, they could be unnamed figures on the covers of 18th century fiction anthologies (Joseph Conrad, probably). The English are more talkative, demonstrative and needy. Like the Russians, they're all variations on familiar adventure-movie types, including the casually murderous psycho (Ben Mendelsohn's Fraser) and the teenaged newbie (Bobby Schofield's Tobin) whose innocence strikes fatherly chords in our otherwise cynical skipper. There's also a company man named Daniels (Scoot McNairy), who's so much like the glad-handing sleazeball yuppie Burke from James Cameron's \"Aliens\" that you're not surprised when he replicates some of Burke's more treacherous maneuvers, gesture-for-gesture. \"Black Sea\" looks so gorgeous and moves with such muscular grace that you might forget, or never imagine, that it's a relatively small action movie. It was shot with digital cameras the size of napkin dispensers, mainly inside a 1967-vintage Soviet \"Hunter-Killer\" sub owned by a private collector in the Medway River in the town of Rochester, in Kent. Once the characters batten down the hatches, about 90% of the story occurs within the confines of the submarine, with occasional cutaways that show a miniature version of the vessel diving, surfacing, taking on water, or navigating obstacles. MacDonald and his crew seem not only to have studied the classics of the submarine genre (notably \"Das Boot,\" \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" and \"Crimson Tide\") but to have borrowed specific camera moves and shots (including tilted angles that convey emotional as well as spatial imbalance). \u00a0 There are moments when the script leans too heavily on \"because I said so\" storytelling, pushing the plot to wherever it needs to go without coming up with a way to make it seem as though it's getting there organically. (The psycho Fraser is particularly irritating in this regard; he's at the center of so many sudden, horrendous crises that it makes you think less of Robinson for being reckless enough to hire him.)\u00a0 Nevertheless, \"Black Sea\" holds together, thanks mainly to its airtight rhetorical scheme (the crew members truly are little guys trying to grab a piece of the economic pie that's normally hoarded by one-percenters) and its keen sense of what's actually required to carry out this kind of mission, in terms of materials, training and temperament. Because the script does such a good job of explaining what needs to happen in order for the mission to succeed, your heart starts to race when things don't go as planned. These guys are, in every sense of the phrase, in over their heads, and under ungodly pressure. No wonder they start to crack. Advertisement The film is a technical triumph, filled with keenly judged performances. First among equals is Law, who's managed to pull off a Matthew McConaughey-esque resurgence in recent years, discovering a singular charisma in middle age that he mostly failed to put across in youth. Law will probably never not be handsome, but in this film, his handsomeness feels lived-in, and strangely tragic; with his receding hairline, pasty skin and near-permanent scowl, he seems less like a Hollywood matinee idol than one of those quietly seething fellows at the end of a bar that you know better than to try to cheer up. His coiled anger pulls the story together, and makes the hero comprehensible and sympathetic when he's behaving horribly. Even when Robinson spirals into \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\"-style mania, pushing the crew to its breaking point in pursuit of a fortune that seems increasingly elusive, you don't hate him, because you understand where he's coming from. \u00a0His parting closeup is magnificent: an image of an unappreciated man who's reached his full potential at last.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Out of the Furnace", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"Out of the Furnace,\" about two suffering brothers (Christian Bale and Casey Affleck) in Pennsylvania steel country, hits some of the same notes as \"The Deer Hunter\" and Bruce Springsteen's early albums\u2014\"Darkness at the Edge of Town\" and \"Nebraska\" especially. Unfortunately this film has none of their urgency or sense of control; for long stretches it just doesn't seem to have any idea what, exactly, it wants to say, or be.\u00a0 The trailers promise a white-hot tale of revenge, with Christian Bale's butt-kicking Jesus-with-a-rifle avenging some unspecified horrible fate that has befallen his younger brother, a \u00a0veteran who has fallen in with backwoods gangsters (including Willem Dafoe and Woody Harrelson) and taken up brawling to pay off gambling debts. But the revenge portion of the film takes up maybe the last half-hour, and plays out with a haphazard literal-mindedness. The rest seems torn between two modes: the grimy yet intimate art-house drama, and the star-flattering martyr's tale of a man more sinned against than sinning. Performances as strong as the ones the cast gives here belong in a more less cluttered, deeper film. Advertisement The first hour of this movie from director-cowriter Scott Cooper is atmospheric throat-clearing, establishing the obligation that hero Russell Baze (Bale) feels toward his family. His widowed old father is dying. His younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) has a gambling problem, and has fallen in with a very bad crowd that includes local nightclub owner and criminal fixer John Petty (Dafoe) and Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), a New Jersey hillbilly who lives in the Ramapo mountain forest with his gang. The brutal prologue to \"Out of the Furnace\" finds Harlan sexually terrorizing a date at a drive-in, then beating a man who tries to intervene. The scene effectively establishes that Harlan is not to be messed with, but it also has a whiff of macho art-house pretension, as if somebody saw \"Killer Joe\" and wondered what would happen if you put the harrowing climax of that film at the start of another one. It's also dramatically unnecessary, as Harrelson exudes menace even when he's not moving or speaking. Russell is positioned as a figure who suffers for the sins of others. Fate treats him as a human pincushion. When the movie opens, the hero has a loving girlfriend named Lena (Zoe Saldana) and decent job at the mill (even though the economic crash of 2008, an increasingly important event in recent American cinema, is scaring everyone to death). Soon after paying off his brother's criminal debtors, Russell lands in prison thanks to a mishap that wasn't really his fault. He endures brutality there, and emerges years later. His dad is dead, his former girlfriend has taken up with a local cop (Forest Whitaker, doing a bizarre \"character\" voice that makes him sound like a Muppet), and his younger brother, now a psychologically devastated war veteran, is bare-knuckle brawling in Harlan's secret matches to pay off his gambling debts.\u00a0 You could figure out where this story is going even if the ads and trailers hadn't made it crystal-clear. \"Out of the Furnace\" takes a long time to arrive at the inevitable point when Russell decides to take bloody action, without providing enough depth to make the lingering beforehand feel like time well-spent, and without envisioning the criminal showdowns in anything but the most perfunctory way.\u00a0The geographic and cultural details are documentary-credible, but its situations are pure Hollywood. This is an awkward mix that not many films can pull off.\u00a0 Advertisement Had \"Out of the Furnace\" been willing to fully embrace its coincidences, overheated emotions and allegorical touches, it could have been one of the great Guy Movies of all time, a bro tragedy on the level of \"The Indian Runner,\" \"A Perfect Storm\" and, yes, \"The Deer Hunter\" (a film that wouldn't be name-checked repeatedly in this review if \"Out of the Furnace\" didn't strive to remind you of it, at one point brazenly lifting a key sequence involving a rifle, a deer and a moment of hesitation).\u00a0Cooper's film has every element that bro tragedy requires: decent-souled yet emotionally constipated men toiling in working-class professions; a criminal subplot that leads to a grave offense and a desire for vengeance; a sense of an old order passing and a new, diminished one taking its place; and on the soundtrack, a string-laden orchestral score, interspersed with power ballads that sound as if they're being moaned by a man in pain. Serious or silly, this movie should have been irresistibly grand and propulsive.\u00a0 Instead it limps along, occasionally seizing a glimmer of purpose but then getting distracted by a smoky sunset, a mythic silhouette, or a portentous bit of cross-cutting between moments that don't really have all that much to do with each other. The script, co-written by Cooper and Brad Ingelsby, genuflects toward relevance, citing the War on Terror and the depression of 2008 and beyond, but rather than emerge gracefully from the story, these aspects feel as slapped-on as bumper stickers. Bale has played a number of intriguingly closed-off characters, including Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan's \"Batman\" movies, but his emotionally-numb-De Niro thing doesn't cut it here, however affecting the actor is close-up. The film fetishizes Russell by filming him like an epic hero even though he's a bit of a dope.\u00a0Affleck, one of the best and most original actors in American film, fares better as Rodney, using his high voice and sinewy body as contrast against the character's machismo. He has one scene opposite Bale\u2014an agonized confession of how badly the war has affected him\u2014that hints at the raw, truthful movie that \"Out of the Furnace\" might have been, had its priorities been different. Dafoe is believably conflicted as the guy who lets himself be shamed into hooking Rodney up with money brawls even though he fears that they'll ruin him. Harrelson's Harlan is leering cobra who strikes every chance he gets. Some of his intimidating moments have a Dennis Hopper-like charge that comes from realizing the character is capable of anything; this would be magnificent if Harlan weren't written as a garden-variety thug who lacks imagination.\u00a0 Most of the other actors are wasted, including Saldana, who's stuck in a generic girlfriend role (though she has one effective, painful scene with Bale on a wooden bridge), and Sam Shepard as Russell's uncle, who joins the hero on his adventures but doesn't get much dialogue or meaningful action.\u00a0Halfway through, there's a scene that feels like the beginning of a tighter, tougher, wilder movie, perhaps a \"Walking Tall\" in steel country. You'll know it when you'll see it, because for a fleeting instant you'll be fooled into thinking that \"Out of the Furnace\" is going somewhere.\u00a0 It's a shame, really. This is a rare big-budget American feature that's about working class characters doing things that could actually happen. It isn't a superhero picture, a sci-fi movie, a remake, or an adaptation of a bestselling novel. Mainstream cinema was thick with this sort of film forty years ago, but has offered fewer and fewer examples over time. I wish there were more films like \"Out of the Furnace,\" only good.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Life, Animated", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "When Owen Suskind was three years old, his motor and language skills deteriorated, seemingly overnight. He retreated from the world. His parents took him to specialists, hoping there would be some way to \"fix\" Owen. It was the 1990s, and so autism, or the concept of the \"spectrum\" had not moved into common currency yet. When Owen was diagnosed with autism, his parents were devastated. But finally, light from the caves of Owen's mind: his family discovered that Disney's animated\u00a0movies, beloved by Owen, allowed Owen to access his emotions and put those emotions into words. It was a huge breakthrough. Owen Suskind is now 23 years old, and his journey is the subject of Roger Ross Williams\u2019 heart-rending documentary \"Life,\u00a0Animated.\" Based on the book of the same name written by Owen's father Ron Suskind (a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist), the documentary shows Owen's childhood (through home-movie footage) and flips forward to his current situation where he is about to leave his group home and get his own apartment for the first time. Advertisement Ron Suskind wrote in a 2014 article in The New York Times, \"We were never big fans of plopping our kids in front of Disney videos, but now the question seemed more urgent: Is this good for him? [The doctors] shrug. Is he relaxed? Yes. Does it seem joyful? Definitely. Keep it limited, they say. But if it does all that for him, there\u2019s no reason to stop it.\" Disney movies helped Owen relate to whatever he was going through in his life, and it helped his parents and his older brother communicate. Owen is first shown as an adult, wandering along a sidewalk by himself, speaking what sounds like gibberish. Over the course of the film it becomes clear what he is doing: using funny voices from characters in Disney movies, dialogue from favorites like \"Peter Pan,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"The Lion King,\" \"The Little Mermaid.\" Unlike his three-year-old self, though, he now can speak words other than Disney dialogue (he also taught himself to read from the end-credits of Disney films). He uses slightly formal language, asking his mother at one point after a personal disappointment, \"Why is the world so full of pain and tragedy?\" He spends his time at his group home learning from therapists how to deal with everyday situations, in preparation for his exit from the safe environment. Owen started a Disney Club at his group home, where the residents gather, watch a film and then talk about it afterwards. Owen, leading the discussion, asks the group, \"What is Mustafa teaching Simba?\" Owen is a leader (he is now a spokesman-advocate for people who are autistic). Owen's childhood is presented in the film by his parents, Ron and Cornelia, and his older brother Walt, sharing memories of what happened, how they felt. These backstory sequences are accompanied by home movie footage as well as evocative\u00a0animation, created by Mathieu Betard, Olivier Lescot, Philippe Sonrier. The\u00a0animation\u00a0grows in complexity as Owen starts to join the world. At first, for example, there's a small black-and-white boy shown standing at the end of a long dark hallway, no way out. Later, the\u00a0animation\u00a0goes to fantastical Technicolor, as Owen accesses his own creativity. Owen was bullied in school, and he found comfort in drawing various Disney characters. Ron Suskind, looking at the piles of artwork by his son, realized at one point that Owen only drew the \"sidekicks,\" never the heroes. Owen declares: \"I am the protector of sidekicks. No sidekicks get left behind.\" Throughout, the adult Owen is shown dealing with the stresses of his life by watching Disney films. In the first night in his new apartment, he lies in bed watching \"Bambi,\" in particular the wrenching scene where Bambi's mother is killed. It's how Owen feels: He's lonely for his mother. The Disney movie says, \"We know. This is tough. Bambi got through it and so will you.\" Disney footage abounds in \"Life,\u00a0Animated,\" and these familiar images resonate in a totally new way, as seen through Owen's eyes. They are stories about adversity, pain, looking for belonging, sparks of joy and togetherness, being lost and then being found. The first thing Owen does in his new apartment is unpack his boxes and boxes of Disney movie VHS tapes. Advertisement Life is not all sunshine and roses. Owen's anxiety is often acute and debilitating. Ron and Cornelia still tear up when they talk about Owen \"vanishing\" (Ron's word) at age three. Owen's older brother Walt, older and wiser than his 26 years, speaks openly about his fear of what will happen to Owen later in life, what will happen when their parents die. It will be Walt's responsibility to make sure that Owen is okay, and the thought is overwhelming. Owen has a girlfriend named Emily, and there's an endearing scene where Walt and Owen play miniature golf, and Walt tries to give his brother the \"birds and bees\" talk, to prepare him for what a relationship might entail. Walt gives it a shot, saying, hoping Owen will fill in the blank, \"When people kiss, they don't just kiss with their lips. They kiss with their ... \" Owen guesses, \"Feelings?\" (It's actually a pretty good answer.) \"Life,\u00a0Animated\" is powerful and emotional, without being manipulative. It is deeply inspiring, without trying to be. It is honest about Owen's struggles, and the struggles of his family. It does not soft-pedal the difficulties. It shows the group-effort of the family to set Owen up in life, get him the help he needs, and validate who he is (as opposed to who they wish he could be, as opposed to yearning for who he was \"before\"). \"Life,\u00a0Animated\" is also (perhaps the most moving part of all) a testament to the power of art and a shining example of what it can do.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "BPM (Beats Per Minute)", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "In 1959, the writer and philosopher Guy Debord, best known for his work on what he called \u201cthe society of the spectacle,\u201d made a short film called \u201cOn the Passage of a Few Persons Through a Rather Brief Unity of Time.\u201d A simple title, but one with a lot of implications. It could serve as an alternate title for the French film\u00a0\u201cBPM (Beats Per Minute).\" Known as\u00a0\u201cbattements par minute\u201d in French, the phrase that initially\u00a0referred to the human heart was then\u00a0applied to modern dance music. The way this movie relates to the Debord title is in the fictionalized story it tells, about the Paris branch of the AIDS activism group ACT UP in the 1990s. Directed by Robin Campillo from a script by Campillo and Philippe Mangeot, the movie opens with a few members of the group storming the stage during a government presentation on their handling of the AIDS crisis. Their shock tactics get a little out of hand, and the movie cuts to a meeting of the group after the fact, comparing notes, admitting fault, expressing humorous confusion at the contradictions between individual accounts, and discussing what to do next. The movie makes canny use of non-linear editing, moving backwards and forwards with engaging fluidity, and it keeps this up throughout. But the movie, in its 140-minute or so running time, sets itself down purposefully enough to give the audience a good look at several characters sharing a \u201cunity of time\u201d in different ways.    Advertisement There\u2019s Thibault (Antoine Reinartz), the pragmatic head of the group, who\u2019s always looking to achieve a balance between the eye-opening protests of the group and a kind of constructive engagement with the government officials and big pharma reps who are slow to respond to the crisis. Sophie (Ad\u00e8le Haenel) is one of the relatively few women in the group, an eloquent and energetic front-of-the-line type. The group\u2019s makeup is mostly of gay men, but it\u2019s hardly exclusive. The teen Max (Felix Maritaud) got the HIV virus by transfusion, and both he and his single mom H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (Catherine Vinatier) are passionate factors in the group. Max mixes up, in his apartment bathtub, the fake blood that the group uses to decorate the office of one pharma company at which it stages an intervention.    None of these characters come across as a \u201ctype\u201d during the scenes in which we get to know them. The actors delineate them as strong individuals. The film\u2019s sharpest focus is often trained on Sean (Nahuel P\u00e9rez Biscayart), a pint-sized provocateur whose passion is matched by fierce logic and charismatic eloquence. He forms what seems an unlikely romance with Nathan (Arnaud Valois), a hunky, quiet newbie whose negative HIV status arouses initial suspicion when he joins the group. Their love story is frank, sometimes funny, and eventually heart-rending.\u00a0 What the movie does, beautifully, and unfortunately, necessarily, is remind the viewer that the axiom \u201cthe political is personal\u201d is not a fluffball bromide to be set aside in the postmodern world. \u201cBPM\u201d recounts with precision an era in which people died in part because governments tacitly (and sometimes not tacitly) agreed worldwide that a particular virus was punishment for deviant behavior and thus not something that deserved urgent attention. The tactics of ACT UP were deemed \u201cextremist\u201d by many. This movie demonstrates the humanity of these activists, people whose backs were against a wall. It does so with humor, compassion, affinity, and no condescension. Even if you consider yourself reasonably well-versed in the history, \u201cBPM\u201d is a kind of wake-up call, a cinematic alarm against complacency. Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Mine", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Fabio Guaglione & Fabio Resinaro\u2019s \u201cMine\u201d is practically a one-man show. There are tech elements that are essential to its success, but this film lives and dies on what Armie Hammer does at its center. He\u2019s not only in every scene, he\u2019s often the only person in the scene, playing a guy trapped in the middle of nowhere and reflecting on exactly how he got there. Hammer is riding a wave of success and acclaim, appearing in \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d and \u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d last year and about to blow people away in \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d later this year. It\u2019s easy to see him becoming one of his generation\u2019s most interesting actors. And when that happens people will come back to this relatively small thriller and appreciate how he\u2019s had the skills for some time now. Every time that \u201cMine\u201d threatens to come apart under its own pretensions (which is relatively often), Hammer does something subtle and believable to ground it.\u00a0 Advertisement Mike (Hammer) is a sniper; Tommy (Tom Cullen) is his spotter. They are on a ridge, on assignment in a dusty land, when it looks like their target is in sight. A convoy comes over the horizon, met by another group of people in the sand. Over the radio, Mike hears that their target is in the last car, but the color is wrong. Mike hesitates. What if this is the wrong guy? And the situation is complicated even further when Mike and Tommy realize that the group below them is gathered for a wedding. Is Mike really going to shoot the father of the bride at a ceremony when he\u2019s not even positive it\u2019s the right guy? He hesitates long enough that the situation goes haywire, and Mike and Tommy are forced to walk hours to the nearest village. Then Tommy steps on a land mine. And so does Mike.  Much like \u201cBuried\u201d or \u201cThe Shallows\u201d trapped their protagonist in a specific place, Mike literally can\u2019t move his left foot or risk going boom. He calls in the disastrous situation they\u2019re in and is told that someone can come rescue him \u2026 in 72 hours. He considers something daring called \u201cThe Shoeman Maneuver\u201d that involves basically digging a trench next to you and then trying to fall in it in time to minimize damage. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll only lose a leg. He has to deal with sandstorms, running out of water, and animals in the middle of the night. And then he starts going crazy, flashing back to his abusive father and a wife he left behind. \u201cMine\u201d is unapologetically philosophical. We all have land mines in our life that we\u2019re not willing to step off, dude. It\u2019s a film in which a character literally says, \u201cEvery day can be your last step.\u201d Oh, really? Thanks. In remembered moments of his past that got him here, we literally hear a mine sound, as if Mike has stepped on them symbolically before. We get it. \u201cMine\u201d is the kind of movie in which you will even likely say, out loud, \u201cWe get it,\u201d at least once. It hammers its themes and messages, and then hammers them again and again and again. Advertisement While it\u2019s clear that the filmmakers were somewhat scared of the simplicity of their concept in the way they weigh it down with flashbacks and messaging, the real tragedy is that Hammer could have pulled off a real one-man show. He does some of the hardest work of his career here, conveying both the trauma of his situation and the baggage that Mike brought with him to the desert. We believe that Mike is likely going to die\u2014eaten by animals, blown up by a mine, or simply dying of thirst. It\u2019s odd to say that Hammer gives a physical performance given he\u2019s stuck in one place, but he remarkably sells his predicament as a real, dangerous one. The film works because of him (with a shout-out to excellent editing by Filippo Mauro Boni, Guaglione, and Matteo Santi, too).\u00a0It\u2019s a really good performance from an actor I suspect will give several great ones over the course of his career.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Mad Max: Fury Road", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "George Miller\u2019s \u201cMad Max\u201d films didn\u2019t just make Mel Gibson\r\na star\u2014they completely transformed post-apocalyptic entertainment with their\r\nvisceral stunt work and singular vision of an increasingly desperate future.\r\nThree decades after the last film, the oft-maligned \u201cMad Max Beyond\r\nThunderdome,\u201d Miller finally returns to this desolate landscape for the\r\nhighly-anticipated \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d recasting the title role in the\r\ngrizzled visage of Tom Hardy and upping the stakes with promises of vehicular\r\nmayhem on a level commensurate with what modern CGI audiences have come to\r\nexpect.  Advertisement From its very first scenes, \u201cFury Road\u201d vibrates with the\r\nenergy of a veteran filmmaker working at the top of his game, pushing us\r\nforward without the cheap special effects or paper-thin characters that have so\r\noften defined the modern summer blockbuster. Miller hasn\u2019t just returned with a\r\nnew installment in a money-making franchise. The man who re-wrote the rules of\r\nthe post-apocalyptic action genre has returned to show a generation of\r\nfilmmakers how they\u2019ve been stumbling in their attempts to follow in his\r\nfootsteps.  \u201cWho was more crazy?\r\nMe, or everyone else?\u201d In \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d Miller has pushed his\r\nGilliam-esque vision of a world gone mad to its logical extreme. No longer are\r\nthe people of Max Rockatansky\u2019s world merely scavengers for oil or power; they\r\nhave been transformed into creatures of circumstance, either left with one\r\ndefining need or left without any semblance of reason. \u201cFury Road\u201d is a violent\r\nfilm, but the violent acts in this world don\u2019t feel like arbitrary action\r\nbeats\u2014they emerge from a complete lack of other options or a firm sense of\r\nstraight-up insanity. Miller\u2019s new vision of Max isn\u2019t a warrior. Rather, he\u2019s\r\na man driven by the memories of past sins to do little more than survive. He\r\nwalks with the ghosts of those he couldn\u2019t save, and his traveling companions\r\nhave pushed him to the brink of sanity. While wandering at this edge, Max is kidnapped and transformed\r\ninto a literal blood bag for a feral warrior named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who\r\nserves the whims of his maniacal ruler, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who\r\nalso played the villain Toecutter in the original \u201cMad Max\u201d). From the start,\r\nMiller gives you no time to \u201cease\u201d into this world or the story he wants to\r\ntell. The frame rate is accelerated, the editing is hyperactive, the bad guy\r\nspeaks through a mask that makes half his dialogue indecipherable (shades of\r\nHardy\u2019s Bane from \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d), and the horrific visions of Miller\u2019s\r\ntwisted future come fast and furious. Immortan Joe is a barely-alive freak of\r\nnature, kept breathing by tubes connected to his face and served by similarly\r\ndisfigured half-humans with definitive names like Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones)\r\nand The People Eater (John Howard).  Advertisement One of Joe\u2019s most notable warriors is a powerful woman known\r\nas Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who, as the film opens, is leading a\r\nconvoy from Immortan Joe\u2019s citadel to the oil refinery Gastown when she\r\ndeviates off course. It turns out that Furiosa has kidnapped Joe\u2019s \u201cbreeders,\u201d\r\nthe women he keeps prisoner in an effort to create a male heir. She\u2019s taking\r\nthem to \u201cthe green place,\u201d to safety. Of\r\ncourse, Joe sends his men after Furiosa\u2014including Nux, to whom Max is still attached\u2014and\r\nthe rest of \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d consists of one long sustained chase across\r\nthe unforgiving desert. With the exception of one centerpiece of dialogue, the\r\nfilm takes place almost entirely on the move, speeding, chasing, bouncing, and\r\nexploding across Miller\u2019s scorched landscape. As a reflection of more desperate times, Miller has updated\r\nthe needs of his future world from commodities like oil to pure survival. Max\r\nhas been reimagined as a fighting, driving machine, a man who \u201cfinds his own\r\nway,\u201d moving forward in an attempt to outrun his ghosts. Nux is a brainwashed\r\ngoon, a man-creature who believes that he will die and be reborn after\r\nsacrificing himself for a trip to Valhalla. Max eventually steps into the role\r\nof the action hero, but, in one of his most daring moves, Miller gives the\r\nweight of the narrative to Furiosa, a woman who holds on to the only thing that\r\ncould possibly give her hope in this violent world\u2014the next generation. Theron\r\ndoes arguably the best work of her career here, artfully conveying the drive in\r\nFuriosa\u2019s soul in a way that fuels the entire film. She does more with a\r\nsearing stare or clenched jaw than most actresses could with a page of\r\ndialogue. And one shouldn\u2019t undervalue the empowerment message at the heart of\r\nthis film\u2014Eve Ensler, author of \u201cThe Vagina Monologues\u201d consulted with Miller\r\non the script\u2014which suggests that women, as the creators of new life, will,\r\ninherently, always be the gender that holds hardest onto hope for the future.\r\nFuriosa looks at the insanity of the male leadership around her and decides\r\nenough is enough. When one of Furiosa\u2019s wards goes into labor and still defends\r\nherself and her yet-to-be-born child (after being shot no less), it\u2019s hard not\r\nto see \u201cFury Road\u201d as an answer to the macho nonsense that so often defines the\r\naction genre.  But none of that should remotely imply that the action here\r\nis lost in the message. The pacing, the sound design, the editing, the music\r\n(courtesy of Junkie XL and some of Joe\u2019s freaks who play drums and electric\r\nguitars during the action), and even the emotional stakes are all so far above\r\naverage that they make just about any other car-chase movie look like a quaint\r\nSunday drive by comparison. The first chase in \u201cFury Road,\u201d as Joe\u2019s men catch\r\nup to Furiosa and her precious cargo, is one of the most remarkable action\r\nsequences in film history. And that\u2019s really just a warm-up. It\u2019s no\r\nexaggeration to say that, if you think something in \u201cFury Road\u201d is the most breathtaking\r\naction stunt you\u2019ve seen in years, you really need only wait a few minutes to\r\nsee something better. This is a movie where you keep thinking that its reached its\r\napex and then, inexplicably, that moment is left behind in the dust. Advertisement From the very beginning, Miller and his team do something\r\nthat so many other filmmakers fail to do\u2014they define the geography of their\r\naction. Rather than merely tossing the camera around in the vain hopes of\r\ncreating tension, they constantly give the viewer overhead shots and clear\r\nphysical dimensions of what\u2019s happening and where we\u2019re going. And then they\r\nblow it all up. There are dozens of crashes, explosions, and flying bodies in\r\n\u201cFury Road,\u201d and yet the piece never gets repetitive, especially as the\r\nemotional stakes increase with each sequence. Miller knows when to let the pace\r\ncoast when it needs to, which is rarely, and then he pushes the pedal down and\r\nplasters you to your seat.  \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d is an action film about redemption and\r\nrevolution. Never content to merely repeat what he\u2019s done before (even the\r\nfirst three \u201cMad Max\u201d have very distinct personalities), Miller has redefined his\r\nvision of the future yet again, vibrantly imagining a world in which men have become\r\nthe pawns of insane leaders and women hold fiercely onto the last vestiges of\r\nhope. \u201cFury Road\u201d would be remarkable enough as a pure technical\r\naccomplishment\u2014a film that laughs in the face of blockbuster CGI orgies with\r\nsome of the best editing and sound design the genre has ever seen\u2014and yet\r\nMiller reaches for something greater than technical prowess. He holds aloft the\r\naction template that he created with \u201cThe Road Warrior\u201d and argues that\r\nHollywood shouldn\u2019t have been copying it for the past three decades, they\r\nshould have been building on it. \u201cFury Road\u201d is a challenge to a whole\r\ngeneration of action filmmakers, urging them to follow its audacious path into the\r\ngenre\u2019s future and, like Miller, try their hardest to create something new.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Look of Silence", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Director Joshua Oppenheimer\u2019s \u201cThe Act of Killing,\u201d a most\r\nunusual treatment of mass murder and the people who commit it, galvanized both\r\ndocumentary audiences and filmmakers in 2013. Oppenheimer, a writer, activist,\r\nand conceptual artist, invited the perpetrators of ostensibly-anti-Communist,\r\nstate-sponsored killings in 1960s Indonesia to reenact their deeds as heroic\r\nmovie scenes. The results, I myself noted at the time, were \u201cbracingly\r\nghastly,\u201d and also disturbing in their deeper revelations.  Advertisement Oppenheimer\u2019s new film, \u201cThe Look of Silence,\u201d is a\r\ndeliberate companion piece to \u201cKilling,\u201d and it too is strong and upsetting.\r\nIts conceptual framework isn\u2019t nearly as idiosyncratic as the previous film\u2019s,\r\nand that could be to its advantage. Instead of working with multiple criminal\r\nsubjects, Oppenheimer settles in with the family of one victim. \u201cSilence\u201d tells\r\nthe story of this man\u2019s death\u2014which, because of its circumstances, gained a\r\ncertain symbolic weight with certain Indonesians over time\u2014through the eyes of\r\nhis younger brother, Adi, an optometrist in his early 40s who was born after\r\nthe killings and was seen by his now very-aged parents as, if not a replacement\r\nfor their older child, a kind of proxy for him. The movie opens with Adi watching a television monitor,\r\nlooking at footage in which an older man gleefully recounts a killing. \u201cI\r\nripped him open; his intestines spilled out.\u201d A series of titles tells the\r\nviewer that over one million supposed \u201cCommunists\u201d were murdered during the\r\nperiod of Indonesian turmoil, and that the \u201cperpetrators still hold power\r\nthroughout the country.\u201d Oppenheimer and his cameras follow Adi as he travels\r\naround rural areas of his country, giving eye exams and prescribing glasses for\r\nseveral of his interview subjects, who confess their doings with often shocking\r\nnonchalance. Adi, who explains early on that \u201cWhen I meet older people, I like\r\nto hear about the past,\u201d is an often cheerful, pragmatic fellow who enjoys a\r\nlight-hearted relationship with his own daughter; when he watches the footage\r\nof confessed killers or listens in person to one-time thugs, his face takes on\r\na cast of intense scrutiny, the look of silence to which the film\u2019s title\r\nrefers. In a sense, he teaches the viewer on the other side of the screen how to\r\nprocess these stories.  And what appalling stories they are. \u201cDrinking your victim\u2019s\r\nblood is important, otherwise you\u2019ll go crazy,\u201d one old man tells Adi. A\r\none-time military man brags about trying to solicit a cruise to the U.S.A.\r\nafter completing his killing labors; he\u2019s earned such a thing, he says, because\r\n\u201cWe did this because America taught us to hate Communists.\u201d In the school room\r\nwhere one of Adi\u2019s children is taught, a teacher explains to his charges that\r\nthe \u201cCommunists\u201d had to go because they were \u201ccruel\u201d and would mutilate the\r\nfaces of military Generals who wouldn\u2019t cooperate with them, which is an interesting\r\nlittle fabrication. \u201cSo the communists weren\u2019t cruel?\u201d the child asks Adi later\r\non. It\u2019s a tough question for many reasons, one being that in many, many cases, the \u201cCommunists\u201d weren\u2019t even Communists.  Advertisement Almost as maddening and frightening as this material is the\r\nattitude adopted by some interviewees; \u201cThe wound has healed,\u201d grumbles someone\r\nwho doesn\u2019t want the murders brought up; the irony of someone who had a hand in\r\nperpetrating the wound pronouncing it \u201chealed\u201d is an exasperating one. Then there\u2019s\r\nthe ex-military man who starts lecturing Adi: \u201cDo the relatives of the victims\r\nwant this to start happening again?\u201d he rumbles, quaking a bit. The real danger\r\nthat Adi placed himself in is underscored by the film\u2019s end credits:\r\nOppenheimer\u2019s co-director is called \u201cAnonymous,\u201d and there are over thirty more\r\nacknowledgements of an \u201cAnonymous\u201d as the credits scroll down.  The 2003 documentary \u201cThe Corporation\u201d made much of the U.S.\r\nlegal gymnastics that grant corporations a kind of personhood, along with attendant\r\nrights, and concluded that if a corporation were a person, it would be a\r\nmalevolent sociopath. The portrait of Indonesia that emerges from \u201cThe Act of\r\nKilling\u201d and \u201cThe Look Of Silence\u201d places the national character in a sort of\r\nongoing psychotic fugue state. Post-Holocaust discourse frequently used the\r\nphrase \u201cNever Again\u201d as a slogan, specifically referring to persecution of the\r\nJews but also denoting a prohibition against barbarism; the events under\r\nconsideration in these films are dispiriting reminders that human progress in\r\nthis area has been meager at best.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Lobster", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"The Lobster,\" a black-hearted flat-affect comedy from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, making his English-language debut, presents a dystopian world where being single is a criminal act. A romantic breakup thrusts the \"single\" into the outer darkness of society. (Like all good satire, \"The Lobster\" is close enough to reality to disturb the waters.) A single person has 45 days after a breakup to find a new partner, and if the new partner does not materialize, the single person will be turned into an animal. The message is clear: Couples deserve official protection, and the privilege of being left alone by the unnamed State. Single people are accosted in public spaces with demands for appropriate papers. \"The Lobster\" plays rigorously by its own rules without once telegraphing \"Just kidding!\" While extremely funny, it is a bitter and ruthless film. Lanthimos plays target practice and his aim is deadly. Advertisement In its opening, David (Colin Farrell, in a wonderful performance) listens passively to the off-screen voice of a girlfriend, telling him it's over. The next scene shows David (dog in tow) checking into a hotel, answering a series of extremely intimate questions about his personal life. Not once does he balk. We don't understand the rules yet of this world, but David clearly does. (The script was co-written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, who collaborated before on \"Dogtooth\" and \"Alps\".) Soon the situation becomes clear: David has come to a facility where single people try to find a mate. No New-Agey retreat, this: the stakes are too high. There are callbacks to films as various as \"Defending Your Life,\" \"Never Let Me Go,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" and \"Safe,\" an institutionalized environment devoted to controlling the chaos of human emotions. There are expeditions in the forest, filmed in luxurious slo-mo, guests hunting each other down with stun guns, winnowing down the ranks. There are demonstrations in a lecture hall about the dangers of being single. (A woman walking by herself is attacked. A woman walking with a man is safe. And etc.) One night there is a dance, and a more joyless event could not be imagined. David befriends a couple of other inmates (no other word for it): a lisping man played by John C. Reilly and a limping man played by Ben Whishaw. Relationship rules require that the lisp-er mate with another lisp-er and the limp-er find another limp-er. It's a brutal fun-house-mirror of romantic compatibility. If every interaction contains the possibility of monogamy as well as societal-redemption, not to mention avoiding being turned into an animal, then personal connection becomes not only impossible but irrelevant. Colin Farrell gives one of his funniest and (strangely enough, considering the humorlessness of the character) charming performances since \"In Bruges,\" as David. David is baffled, obedient, depressed, defeated. Watch his face as he listens to other people's \"testimonies\" at group events. There's not a hint of self-awareness there. He has zero sense of the absurd. David is a mushy lukewarm pudding of a man. With his mustache and pot belly and nondescript glasses, Farrell is a completely believable everyman. \"The Lobster\" is narrated in a monotone by Rachel Weisz, who doesn't enter the film until some way in. The tone of the narration is key: It is as though Weisz is reading a love poem in botched translation by a third grader. She sounds like a child trying to talk the way she thinks adults talk. The term \"deadpan\" does not apply. The way people talk in \"The Lobster\" reveals a complete absence of nuance and subtext. How does one talk about emotions if one has no inner life? It would sound something like Weisz's voiceover in \"The Lobster.\" It's truly bizarre, with a devastating and comedic cumulative effect. Advertisement The second half of the film takes place in the forest surrounding the facility, teeming with random recently-human animals as well as a tough band of escaped \"Loners,\" their fierce leader played by L\u00e9a Seydoux. Seydoux gives a charismatic and terrifying performance, reminiscent of the \"children of Marx and Coca Cola\" in Jean-Luc Godard's early work, most particularly Veronique, the heartless redheaded revolutionary in \"La Chinoise.\" The freedom Seydoux represents is heady and deadly as pure oxygen. Her ideal is Kipling's Cat, who \"walked by himself ... through the wet Wild Woods, waving his wild tail, and walking by his wild lone.\" But in order for freedom like that to be possible, there must be rules. Lots of rules. Lanthimos is interested, here and in his other films, in the sometimes pathological human need for systems. Why wait for a totalitarian government to institute rules from the top-down when human beings submit to atomization of every aspect of their lives all on their own? If this \"need\" is wired into the human race, then where does that leave the individual? An individual who doesn't \"go along\" becomes a renegade, an outlaw, an unwelcome reminder that the system doesn't work for everyone. Lanthimos clocks the fact\u2014and relentlessly lampoons it with surgical precision\u2014that society values couples more it values single people. Valentine's Day, to a single person, can feel like living in a one-party State bombarding the populace with non-stop propaganda. Every magazine, commercial, movie, daytime talk show is a never-ending parade of relationship advice and aspirational examples of love winning out. Even the dropdown menu choices of \"Mr.\" \"Miss.\" and \"Mrs.\" forces individuals to state their relationship status (and, of course, men get to be \"Mr.\" whether they're single or not). It goes without saying that these everyday annoyances do not amount to \"oppression,\" but they are omnipresent enough that Lanthimos follows them out to their most extreme conclusions. What about \"opting out\" of all of it? But look out, freedom-seekers: Sociopaths like L\u00e9a Seydoux's character emerge out of power vacuums practically on schedule. The forest section of \"The Lobster\" doesn't work as well as the section in the facility, Seydoux's performance notwithstanding. Without the walls of the complex pressing in on the characters, the satire floats around in the air, searching for its proper landing-point. Lanthimos' real target is inside that facility. However, as \"The Lobster\" marches towards its conclusion, it becomes clear that it intends to go the distance. Lanthimos will not cop out on what his film has unleashed. In a world devoted to happy endings, where platitudes like \"the right person is out there waiting for you\" or \"someday your Prince will come\u201d are parroted as Unquestioned Truths, the film is a welcome breath of freezing cold, poisoned air.

{"Title": "Master", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Cho Ui-seok\u2019s \u201cMaster\u201d drops us into what might be considered second-act material for most films, but this epic has 143 minutes to go and there\u2019s no time for set-up. And so we meet Kim Jae-Myung (Dong-won Gang) deep into his criminal investigation of power player Jin Hyun-Pil (Byung-hun Lee). Kim is an audience member for a speech being given by Jin to his most emotional supporters. Even Jin is moved to tears by the powerful unity he\u2019s created through the One Network, one of the most profitable companies in all of Korea. However, as Kim has discovered through his work in the Financial Crimes Unit, Jin\u2019s empire is built on a pyramid scheme. While Jin preaches to his choir like a cult leader, Kim plans to take him down.  Advertisement The opening scenes of \u201cMaster\u201d promise an intricate, complex crime thriller a la \u201cInfernal Affairs\u201d and \u201cDrug War,\u201d and there are glimpses of that kind of movie buried within this often-talky, bloated flick that\u2019s more often concerned with money laundering than gunfire. The performances are solid to great throughout, and Cho does build to a remarkably satisfying final twenty minutes, but it takes two hours to get there, and much of those 120 minutes are weighed down with overdirected scenes of people planning, negotiating, or staring at computer screens. There\u2019s little that's less thrilling than scenes of people hacking furiously.  One of those hackers is the fascinating Park Jang-gun (Woo-bin Kim), who Captain Kim takes into custody in the film\u2019s opening moments. Park becomes the bridge between Dong-won Gang\u2019s Al Pacino and Byung-hun Lee\u2019s Robert De Niro to, use a \u201cHeat\u201d analogy. As Kim and his team force Park to set Jin up for arrest, this version of Gordon Gekko learns that there\u2019s a mole in his operation. The first hour of \u201cMaster\u201d focuses on this dynamic\u2014the informant in the system and the way both sides push and pull at the young man, who may have a plan of his own to come out of this disaster as the ultimate winner. It culminates in a fantastic tunnel sequence, full of twists and turns, and something of an ending at the midway point of the film.  Then \u201cMaster\u201d keeps going. For basically the length of an entire new film. Without spoilers, the movie sort of resets and Kim\u2019s operation has to start over again, only with international repercussions. It\u2019s almost like two films in a potential franchise were written, the team decided neither movie could stand on their own, and so they were smashed together. It makes for a somewhat exhausting, undeniably repetitive affair. The second hour of the film goes through many of the same motions as the first, and the characters just aren\u2019t resonant or vibrant enough for us to care. Lee is a great actor (and you really should check out his work in \u201cThe Good, the Bad, and the Weird\u201d if you have yet to do so), but he\u2019s not given enough to work with here. However, it\u2019s a testament to his remarkable charisma that he still outshines Gang, who\u2019s somehow even more woefully underwritten. And that\u2019s a not-uncommon problem of these thrillers\u2014the villain is way more interesting than the cop, leaving us to wonder exactly who we should be rooting for. Advertisement Perhaps that\u2019s why Woo-bin Kim walks away with so much of the movie. While the good cop and the bad businessman are archetypes in which \u201cMaster\u201d cannot find something new to say, Kim\u2019s \u201cman in the middle\u201d is pretty fascinating, and this young actor grounds the entire film. He\u2019s easily the most interesting character, the one with shifting morals and an uncertain future.  And despite my issues with the bloated midsection of \u201cMaster,\u201d the final twenty minutes almost justify the lengthy journey. Cho finally delivers in these scenes, twisting and turning his plot, while also giving us the car chases and gunfire we\u2019ve been waiting for. The only question is if you\u2019ll still be awake by the time he gets there.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Under the Shadow", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Total silence is rare in \"Under the Shadow.\" There is the wind, sometimes a whisper, sometimes a roar. Radio stations blare shouted speeches and chanting crowds. Calls to prayer echo. Air-raid sirens scream. Loudspeakers in the hallways of the college campus blare anthemic music. Even benign sounds\u2014a toaster, a phone ringing, the music in a Jane Fonda workout video\u2014occur at a jarring decibel level. When the background noise drops out, the silence is deafening. Something terrible is happening. The chaos in the outside world infiltrates the interior. \"Under the Shadow,\" a Farsi-language debut feature written and directed by Babak Anvari, creates a world where reality itself is suspect. In a year filled with great first features, add \"Under the Shadow\" to the list. Advertisement Taking place in 1988 Tehran, during the \"war of the cities\" phase of the nearly decade long Iran-Iraq war, \"Under the Shadow\" is the story of Shideh (Narges Rashidi) and Dorsa (Avin Manshadi), a mother and daughter holed up in their apartment, withstanding the missile bombardment. As the attacks increase in frequency, the city empties of people. Shideh and Dorsa remain, at first because Shideh is stubborn, and feeling bullied by her absent husband's demands (over static-crackling phone calls from one of the war fronts where he is stationed) that she go stay with his parents. Shideh refuses, taping X's on the windows, hustling Dorsa into the basement during air raids, pulling out her illegal VCR to do Jane Fonda workouts (after closing the curtains). There are signs early on that all is not entirely well. Shideh has a history of sleepwalking. Dorsa has night terrors. When Shideh is expelled from her medical school for political activity during the Revolution, her husband Iraj (Bobby Naderi) is sympathetic but also says, \"Maybe it's for the best.\" There is simmering resentment in the marriage, exacerbated by the instituting of laws requiring chadors worn in the street and a hemming-in of women's mobility. Those laws have infiltrated personal relationships, highlighting fissures in the home that may have already been there. The atmosphere in the apartment building among the residents is one of whispered rumors, suspicion of one another, belief in portents of doom. An orphan child living with the landlord informs Dorsa that the building is haunted by a djinn. The landlord's wife believes in djinn, telling Shideh: \"They travel on the wind, moving from place to place until they find someone to possess.\" Djinn are most active \"where there is fear and anxiety,\" according to banned Iranian writer Gholam-Hossein Sa\u2019edi, whose book Shideh reads, looking for answers. Shideh tells Dorsa repeatedly there is no such thing as a djinn but slowly, over time, Shideh begins to doubt herself. Things disappear. Dorsa's beloved doll vanishes. Shideh's beloved Jane Fonda tape ends up in the garbage. Shideh's medical textbook, locked in a cabinet, somehow ends up in another apartment. When Shideh finally decides that it's time to go to Iraj's parents, Dorsa refuses to leave until her doll is found. Dorsa develops a fever. And then things get really weird. Advertisement Babak Anvari moves \"Under the Shadow\" from realism into horror almost imperceptibly. It is impossible to know what is real and what is not, what is a result of Shideh's exhaustion and what is a valid response to living in a war zone. Cinematographer Kit Fraser, who also shot Anvari's short films \"Solitary\" and \"Two & Two\" (the latter nominated for a BAFTA) starts with a naturalistic style and then shifts, the apartment becoming a manifestation of its trapped inhabitants' psyches. Cracks in the ceiling exaggerate themselves overnight. The concrete steps to the basement stretch down into darkness like a disorienting Escher woodcut. The tarp held down over the hole in the roof from the intrusion of an unexploded missile snaps in the wind like a sentient being. While \"Under the Shadow\" has much in common with \"The Babadook,\" especially in its portrayal of shared sleep-deprivation in mother and child as well as an interior that morphs into a nightmarescape before our eyes, it is also reminiscent of Roman Polanski's \"Repulsion,\" where grasping arms emerge from hallway walls suddenly, soft like clay, and gigantic cracks shiver across walls and ceiling. The building in \"Under the Shadow\" swallows up dolls and people and textbooks and VHS tapes. It's filled with the sounds of knocking and rattling, far-away shrieks and moans (Alex Joseph's sound design is superb). You can take all of this at face value, or you can take it as a metaphor for the destruction outside those walls, from the war, from the Revolution before it. It works either way. The trauma of war and societal upheaval is rendered human-sized in \"Under the Shadow,\" even with the paranormal elements. Anvari is Iranian-born, with childhood memories of the Revolution and the years following. \"Under the Shadow\" is clearly a personal film, and Anvari has assembled an extremely talented team to make that a reality. Production designer Nasser Zoubi and set decorator Karim Kheir create the period gently, without a hint of nostalgic fetishism. The visual effects are sparingly used but truly spooky, and there are many spine-chilling scream-worthy moments. Advertisement The two leads, Rashidi and Manshadi, create a relationship prickling with tension and impatience, exploding into mutual rage and suspicion. It is amazing to consider that this is Manshadi's debut. When she digs her heels in, she really digs her heels in. Her eyes squint with hostility when she looks at her mother tearing apart a bedroom looking for the missing doll. Dorsa sees things her mother cannot. She speaks to entities that are not there. She believes. Rashidi's visceral performance is meticulously structured in its emotional progression, although the end result does not feel \"structured\" at all. What we see is a woman losing her mind. The cracks in the ceiling open ... what will come through? Can it be kept out? Will the solid ever be solid again? There is no escape, for characters or audience. \"Under the Shadow\" is unnerving in the extreme.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Gimme Danger", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In a sense, the weirdest thing about \u201cGimme Danger\u201d is how not weird it is. Its subject, James Osterberg, also known as Iggy Pop, also known as Iggy Stooge, is not just a rock and roll survivor (so to speak) of the first stripe. He\u2019s also, like it or not, one of the maverick eccentrics of the form and the lively arts in general. He\u2019s a rock classic, but if your idea of Classic Rock is Boston, he\u2019s also a major weirdo. Similarly, Jim Jarmusch, the director of this documentary, is a filmmaker whose work is arguably not inaccessible but whose aesthetic lies pretty far outside of what we know as the mainstream. \u201cGimme Danger\u201d is by far the most conventional film he\u2019s ever made. I think that\u2019s a very purposeful feature of the film.  Advertisement \u201cGimme Danger\u201d is subtitled \u201cStory of The Stooges\u201d and that\u2019s important\u2014the movie doesn\u2019t give much play to Iggy\u2019s long and varied solo career, which at many points was far more commercially successful than that of the band he co-founded and fronted in the late \u201860s. Jim Jarmusch has described it as a \u201clove letter\u201d to the Stooges, but it is also a kind of brief for the band. Its accessible form, in which the normally more minimalist Jarmusch resorts to a lot of the standard tropes of the contemporary documentary\u2014talking head style (more or less) interviews, far-reaching archival footage, even animated recreations of events described by the participants\u2014seems to me as an attempt to reach the skeptics in the audience, and convince them that Jarmusch may be right when he calls The Stooges \u201cThe greatest rock and roll band ever.\u201d  This viewer did not need much convincing, I admit. The 60's and 70's Stooges only pulled off one album that I would call \u201cperfect,\u201d which is 1970\u2019s \u201cFun House,\u201d and the reason I am able to call it perfect is that I have a higher tolerance for horrible noise (which is what that record\u2019s final cut \u201cL.A. Blues\u201d is mostly made of) than many others. Considered without \u201cL.A. Blues,\u201d though, \u201cFun House\u201d is such a tensile model of ultra-aggressive rock and roll as to be considered miraculous. How did they do it? Iggy has an interesting answer: having assembled the right three partners in musical crime\u2014brother Ron and Scott Asheton on guitar and drums respectively, with Dave Alexander on bass\u2014singer and rhythm technician (trained as a drummer, he collaborated with Scott on the group\u2019s beats) Iggy recalls, \u201cI just started jumping up and down like baboons do when they\u2019re about to fight,\u201d which provoked his bandmates into a sort of frenzy. And the rest is \u201cNow I Wanna Be Your Dog,\u201d and more.  Both Ron Asheton and Scott Asheton have died in recent years, but not before reuniting with Pop for a Stooges revival in the early 21st century. Jarmusch has been working on this project for some time, and so was fortunate enough to log good, informative interviews with the relatively taciturn Ashetons for the movie. They come across as salt-of-the-earth Ann Arbor guys. Ron explains his penchant for wearing Nazi regalia on stage in the early days by talking about his veteran dad\u2019s willy-nilly memorabilia collecting habits. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything political,\u201d he says, and probably was not, but it was still a crummy idea and Asheton seems to realize it while also believing it might not be very rock and roll to admit it. James Williamson, the \u201cRaw Power\u201d guitarist memorialized in Pop\u2019s solo song \u201cDum Dum Boys\u201d as the Stooge who\u2019s \u201cgone straight\u201d (and indeed he had a prosperous career in software development at Sony after he got out of music for a while), brings a somewhat more plainly objective perspective to bear when considering the drug-fueled anarchy of some Stooges gigs and tours. Pop himself recalls \u201cupsetting people wherever we went.\u201d In an often-seen clip from the Dinah Shore talk show of the \u201870s, he boasts, \u201cI think I helped wipe out the '60s.\u201d Advertisement And what a way to go. Jarmusch lays out the Stooges story in a coherent, linear fashion. Fans like myself won\u2019t necessarily learn a whole lot that\u2019s new, but it\u2019s salutary the way Pop pays respect to the black musicians he followed from Detroit to Chicago during the musical apprenticeship of his teens. Johnny Ramone rather controversially said that with the Ramones he wanted to create an aggressive rock form that was, among many other things, \u201cwhite,\u201d and cited The Stooges as a model in this respect. \u201cGimme Danger\u201d shows that Stooges music, like all rock, had deep roots in black music, albeit a black music that did not get heard much outside of certain regions of the country.  But of course it took the personalities and proclivities of the band members to make their new thing happen. Early champion Danny Fields cites their genius and \u201ctheir lack of professionalism\u201d\u2014talk about understatement\u2014as being so intertwined as to be inextricable. And yet from the expanding wreckage the Stooges left in their wake there was a good amount of great music and an even bigger amount of influence. The movie is frequently moving, particularly in its account of the alcohol-abetted death of bassist Alexander, and the almost phoenix-like rise of the reunited band in recent years. This is a history lesson that, conventional or not, rocks hard. It can\u2019t help it.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Marauders", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "How do movies like \u201cMarauders\u201d get made? One assumes that\r\nevery film has a creative impetus at some point in its production, but it\u2019s\r\nincredibly hard to find one buried underneath this morally vile, incompetently\r\nmade thriller. And so one has to wonder if it wasn\u2019t a \u201cpaycheck gig\u201d for\r\neveryone involved. Was it merely the \u201cbusiness\u201d aspect of show business? Or did director\r\nSteven C. Miller set out to make an intense thriller about on-the-edge cops and\r\ndeadly criminals that would rivet viewers to their seats and justify their\r\nticket or On Demand costs? Even for how negatively I responded to the\r\nbafflingly inept \u201cMarauders,\u201d I choose to believe that Miller and his overly\r\ntalented cast didn\u2019t just do it for a paycheck. Even with that in mind, it\u2019s\r\nhard to forgive. Advertisement \u201cMarauders\u201d opens with a scene straight out of this year\u2019s \u201cTriple\r\n9,\u201d as a series of masked men pull off a complex bank heist. They\u2019re dressed\r\nlike the protagonists from the video game \u201cArmy of Two\u201d (impersonal/terrifying skull\r\nmasks and bulletproof gear), and they\u2019re highly-coordinated and technologically\r\nsavvy. They even throw down speakers, so a Siri-esque voice can issue orders\r\ninstead of the actual attackers\u2014ex., \u201cDo not hit the alarm or we will kill your\r\nmanager.\u201d They complete the assault, and on the way out they shoot said bank\r\nmanager point blank with a shotgun. From the beginning, \u201cMarauders\u201d displays\r\nsigns of hyperactive, inept filmmaking, the kind that uses shaky cams and quick\r\ncuts instead of actual visual compositions. It\u2019s angry, loud and annoying. We soon learn that the bank was owned by a high-powered\r\nfigure named Hubert (Bruce Willis, doing the bare minimum he can to get paid),\r\nwho hides secrets of political and business leaders in his safety deposit\r\nboxes. Of course, the criminals of \u201cMarauders\u201d have more complex goals than\r\nmere accumulation of wealth, which is something that FBI Agent Jonathan\r\nMontgomery (Christopher Meloni) quickly uncovers, with the help of fellow\r\nagents Stockwell (Dave Bautista) and Wells (Adrian Grenier), and local cop Mims\r\n(Johnathon Schaech). Mims happens to have a wife dying of cancer, which should\r\nadd to depth to his character but just feels manipulative. \u201cMarauders\u201d is such a by-the-numbers VOD-cop movie that it becomes depressing. A few scenes of plot furtherance as Montgomery\r\ntries to uncover the identity and purpose of the robber-murderers unfold, and\r\nthen we get another crime, and then a bit more procedural, and then another\r\ncrime, and then a conclusion. Roll credits. In between this predictable\r\nstructure, we\u2019re given next to nothing to care about. Meloni is an interesting\r\nchoice for the role that essentially becomes the lead (he\u2019s an underrated actor\r\nwho more often gets supporting roles) but the writers bestow him almost nothing\r\ninteresting to play, forcing anger to become his defining trait. Hence, he\r\nopens doors like he\u2019s mad at them. Grenier looks bored and Bautista gives a\r\nsupporting part more than it deserves. Advertisement And then there\u2019s the final act, full of revelations and twists\r\ndesigned to shock but just rips gigantic plot holes in the rest of\r\nthe film, while also forcing it into a morally dubious conclusion. What is the\r\npoint of \u201cMarauders\u201d?

{"Title": "Copenhagen", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "A guy and a girl bicycle slowly through the streets of  Copenhagen, the colored buildings and wide canals their placid and  beautiful backdrop. The sun is setting, the shadows lengthening, making  the city seem less like an actual place than a dream space, one where  truth can come out, where the regular rules of everyday life no longer  apply, where something else is possible. In its best  moments, \"Copenhagen,\" the debut feature of Mark Raso, who also wrote  the script, takes place in that dream space. Advertisement On the surface, the film sounds like Richard Linklater's \"Before  Sunrise\" or any number of other meet-cute-in-a-foreign-city stories.  But very quickly, other things start to come to the surface, things that  don't quite fit. The tension between the expectations that arise due to the familiar genre and what is actually happening onscreen makes \"Copenhagen\" special, and a bit strange. There's also  the undeniable fact that the girl in the film is, in actuality, a girl. She's half the age of William, the lead  character. So any possibility of romance is distinctly illegal in  nature. \"Copenhagen\" doesn't shy away from that, and is unafraid to  allow that queasy reality to come to the surface. The film doesn't  entirely work, but sometimes things that don't entirely work are  interesting, bringing tension and unresolved issues that start to take  over the film, almost by stealth. It's nice to watch something that  isn't neat, that doesn't play it safe. William (Gethin Anthony) and his pal Jeremy (Sebastian Armesto) are  traveling through Europe, crashing in youth hostels. The whole point of  the trip is to end up in Copenhagen, where William can try to track down  the grandfather he's never met. William's dad was abandoned by his  father. And William's dad was no great shakes in the father department  either. William has a lot of free-floating resentment and rage because  of that. He found an unsent letter his father wrote to his grandfather.  It's in Danish so he has no idea what it says, but he wants to deliver  the letter, decades after it was written. You get the sense that William  is not looking for a loving reconciliation but confirmation that father  figures suck. The trip immediately goes off the rails because Jeremy has brought along  a girlfriend. William is so hostile and unpleasant from the get-go that  it starts to call into question his presence as the lead of the film.  He's nasty to Jeremy's girlfriend in a particularly lecherous way; he's  vicious to Jeremy when they argue about her; he's a whiny petulant  figure. This nastiness is not just an attitude, it's William's default  personality. Gethin Anthony is excellent in that he does not soft-pedal  these qualities, and does not try to plead his character's case for the  audience. He allows William to be as nasty as he is written. It can make  \"Copenhagen\" a trying experience, but there is interesting stuff on the  other side of it. Advertisement After William and Jeremy part ways, William is left to his own devices  in Copenhagen. He needs to find the address on the envelope because he thinks maybe his grandfather still lives there. His initial queries are unsuccessful.  Everything changes when he meets Effy (Frederikke Dahl Hansen), a  waitress in the hotel cafe where he is staying. She clumsily spills  coffee on his table, and he doesn't seem to realize that it is supposed  to be a meet-cute moment because he is rude and ungracious in response.  In a later encounter, he tells her about his search for his grandfather  and her interest is piqued. To Effy, it's kind of like a detective  story, and she takes the lead: she knows that address on the envelope,  she wants them to go check it out together. Effy is intelligent, resourceful, and seems to have unlimited amounts of  time to wander around Copenhagen with this rude American man, tracking  down leads. At first it seems that Effy will be forced to take on the  burden of having to be the now-predictable Manic Pixie Dream Girl: \"the  one\" whose only purpose in life is to lighten up the gloomy male lead.  She has a pink plastic camera and is impulsive to the point of  recklessness. But Effy, like  William, does not quite fit into the genre requirements. She starts to  emerge as an individual. Much of this is due to the grounded performance  from Hansen. She suggests that Effy is not complete yet. She's still in  formation, acting a role a little bit, as young girls sometimes do. There's a beautiful and strange scene where Effy takes William into one  of the museums in Copenhagen. She wants to show him something. It's a  bust from ancient times, a female, and she moves to stand right next to  it, her silhouette and the bust's silhouette highlighted by the thin  white stream of light coming in from the window. Mark Raso allows that  image of the two heads side by side to just sit there for a long time,  still and silent. As the image settles, it becomes clear that Effy and  the bust are practically identical twins. Effy whispers, \"I've never  shown this to anyone.\" William runs his fingers over the bust's face, in  wonder at the resemblance. There's an eroticism in the moment,  problematic and uncomfortable due to the age discrepancy. Advertisement What is so beautiful about that scene, though, is that it is beyond  meaning. The image onscreen is what is important, and what it might mean  is up for grabs. It makes Effy's inner life a place of mystery and  power. She has gone to this museum a lot to visit her doppelg\u00e4nger. She  has wondered about that woman in ancient Greece or Rome, wondered at the  connection. She feels in touch with something eternal in herself. None  of this is stated explicitly but it pulses off the screen. What one may expect to happen does not exactly go down as planned.  \"Copenhagen\" remains true to its own original and somewhat prickly  course. There are moments when it is not clear at all why Effy is even  choosing to hang out with William, who is rude and combative (in moments  big and small). But she wants to know what happened to William's  grandfather. Over the course of the film an interesting thing starts  happening. William starts to take responsibility for the words he uses.  He starts to actually listen to himself and do his best to change  course. A lifetime of being a rude rage-boy will not vanish overnight,  and a lesser film would have made it Effy's job to show him the better  way. But \"Copenhagen\" isn't really about that. Nobody can save you. You  have to save yourself. Talented cinematographer Alan Poon gives us dreamy beautiful shots of  the city, its buildings, canals, cobblestone alleyways, crowded  nightclubs. His work helps ground the film. \"Copenhagen\" knows life is  complex, and knows that most of us are messes most of the time.  Hopefully we all do our best and try not to hurt one another; try to be  kind. William doesn't quite get that, not yet, because he's too self-righteous  and pissed off. But the film is, in many ways, his lurching journey  towards starting to understand that his character is up to him and him  alone.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Pompeii", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "This is a surprisingly old-fashioned disaster movie. In point of fact its old-fashioned-ness is really the only surprising thing about this eye-popping 3D spectacle, directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, an adept handler of eye-popping 3D spectacle, as anyone familiar with the \"Resident Evil\" franchise will tell you, and in some areas of film fandom, tell you over and over again.  The destroyed-by-volcanic-eruption-in-ancient-times city of Pompeii is as old and venerated a cinematic subject as Frankenstein\u2019s monster and train robberies. Working from a script by Janet Scott Batchler and Lee Batchler and others (the never-realized Pompeii project that Roman Polanski abandoned a few years back was to be from a Robert Harris novel), Anderson offers up a narrative device older still, a\u00a0 rich-girl/poor-boy variant that finds doe-eyed tycoon\u2019s daughter Cassia (Emily Browning) falling hard for a Britannia-imported slave gladiator known for a while only as \u201cThe Celt,\u201d but later revealed to possess the mighty name of Milo (Kit Harington, so ripped and buff as to make any ordinary man\u2019s resolve to get to the gym more melt into a puddle of futility). Milo\u2019s a bit of a horse whisperer, which helps him get closer to the young lady, who often seems in the vicinity of equine complaints. His more immediate problem is an upcoming arena battle with a noble, promised-to-be-freed fighter named Atticus.\r\nWhile Cassia\u2019s more immediate problem is the Roman Senator Corvus, come to bargain with her father, and determined to make a wife out of Cassia who, in the words of Jean Hagen in \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \u201ccaint staaaaaand him.\u201d  Advertisement Anyway, wouldn\u2019t you know it, but Corvus was also in charge of the Roman battalion that slaughtered Milo\u2019s family many many years ago. That\u2019s the way things work in ancient cities about to get slathered in volcanic ash in movies. Kiefer Sutherland has a hell of a time playing the relentlessly villainous Corvus\u2014you need really strong passions if you\u2019re going to stick to your petty personal grudges even as fireballs are battering all those around you, so it stands to reason. Why Sutherland chose to filter his villainy through Boris Karloff impersonation is anyone\u2019s guess\u2014it\u2019s not as if the kids are gonna get it\u2014but what the heck, I was entertained.  Somewhat less entertaining is the fake-knowingness of the clich\u00e9 dialogue, as when a piggish slave-buyer complains \u201cYou dragged me out of perfectly acceptable brothel for this,\u201d ar ar ar. As much\u00a0 bloodletting as happens in this movie\u2014and there\u2019s quite a bit of it before the volcano action (presaged by a lot of building foundational cracks and such) gets underway\u2014the movie is otherwise\r\nrelentless in its wholesomeness. There\u2019s more real depravity on the screen and in the soul of Cecil B. De Mille\u2019s 1932 \"The Sign of the Cross\" than there is here. However, the action scenes are choice, and once the clouds of ash and shooting fire and churning seas start up, \"Pompeii\" achieves a momentum that most sensationalist studio fare can\u2019t touch. By the end of the movie one senses that Anderson and company were going for a little bit more, particularly in the, you know, profundity department. But the civilians sitting a row ahead of me just giggled at the movie\u2019s final shot, because, well I guess you\u2019ve heard the saying \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be caught dead like that.\u201d Tough crowd!", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Jem and the Holograms", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Jem and the Holograms\" is one of the weirdest big screen adaptations of a cheap TV cartoon that I've seen. That's praise. I don't know what I expected going into the movie, but it wasn't a coming-of-age drama that compensates for its near plotlessness with charming and sometimes touching performances, astute observations about how today's youth use technology to deepen their sense of community and self, and some lush handheld camerawork (in CinemaScope ratio!) that occasionally evokes, for real, \"The Tree of Life\" and \"To the Wonder.\" If Terrence Malick had directed \"Josie and the Pussycats,\" this is what it might have looked like. As written by Ryan Landels and directed by Jon M. Chu (director of two \"Step Up\" films and \"G.I. Joe: Retaliation\") the film boasts lots of tight shots of people's faces lost in thought, and several self-contained, intimate musical numbers, including an a capella performance in a nightclub that has just suffered a power outage, and an impromptu song on the sand beneath a pier. In a lot of these scenes, a small robot hangs out and makes adorable noises. More about the robot shortly.  Advertisement The source material is a Hasbro cartoon that aired on Saturday mornings in the 1980s, about a teenage singer-songwriter named Jerrica Benton who ends up fronting a band that includes her biological sister and two foster sisters. She wows the record-buying public with the help of her late father's projection system, Synergy, which creates a three-dimensional (and seemingly tactile) alternate identity for her. There are rival bands trying to ruin Jerrica's success and get their hands on Synergy, battles over control of the band and its music (mostly involving their malevolent manager, Eric) and other intrigue. If you're thinking about seeing the film you probably already know all this; I include the summary to point up the contrast between what you might reasonably expect the film to deliver\u2014jangly tween pop, contrived \"humor,\" and an overall air of disposability\u2014and what it actually gives you: a movie which, while never caring too much about entertainment basics, has personality, even a vision.  Aubrey Peeples plays Jem, who narrates the movie as an extended flashback. She tells us how she became a near-instantaneous pop sensation after years of grieving her father's death and living with her blood sister Kimber (Stefanie Scott), foster sisters Shana (Aurora Perrineau) and Aja (Hayley Kiyoko), and everybody's aunt/matriarchial figure, Bailey (Molly Ringwald, who projects such strength and warmth here that you will wish she'd been given more to do).  Kimber uploads Jem's solo acoustic number without her consent to get her to stop hiding her talent and reconnect with the world; the video instantly gets zillions of views and earns them an audition with the rapacious producer Erica Raymond (gender-shifted so that Juliette Lewis can play the role). Erica is a vivid caricature of a hard-driving, insincerely \"sincere\" record industry manipulator, always lip-smackingly corny (the film is a showbiz melodrama, so that's fine). Her dialogue is better than everyone else's, probably because she was the most fun to write. When Jem says she knows all about her because she read her New York Times profile, Erica replies, \"The writer I wasn't sure about, but thank you.\" She gets one of the year's better screen entrances: a closeup of her spike-heeled shoes disembarking a chauffeured car and click-clacking up the family's front walk, kicking a skateboard aside as she goes. Jem doesn't want to dive into the shark pool that is the entertainment industry, but her family's home is under threat of foreclosure. Erica promises her that she and her sisters will be paid in full once their first tour has concluded. Who wouldn't trust a record executive?  There's a \"love interest\" in the form of Erica's road manager and band-minder Rio (Ryan Guzman), who is tasked with making sure they don't drink or smoke or break curfew, but ends up taking a more personal interest in Jem. \"Love interest\" is in quotes because this film's target audience is mainly preteen girls, and it's very chaste; I don't remember more than one kiss in the movie. That said, \"Jem and the Holograms\" is quite good about giving the film a female gaze rather than the customary male one: there's a knowingly gratuitous shot of shirtless Rio, paired with furtive glances by Jem, and several makeover montages, always done from the vantage point of girlfriends bonding through grooming and shopping rather than that of, say, a leering older male studio executive, which might have been the point-of-view if this film had been made in the '80s.  Advertisement \"Jem and the Holograms\" is sweet and relaxed, bereft of meanness, and completely invested in Jem's grief management and her love of her sisters and aunt. There are several moments when it seems to remember that it can't just be pleasant without giving us some kind of story, and suddenly tosses three of four twists at us, all at once. It feels cobbled together, but not in a cynical way. It could have just as easily been a period piece set in the late 1940s, starring a Shirley Temple-type who really wants to get a studio contract so that she can bail out the orphanage where she grew up, or pay for grandma's heart operation, or prevent a wagon load of kittens from being turned into pelts.  In other ways, though, it feels entirely modern, plugged into online life in ways that most recent films that are explicitly about technology somehow can't manage. Peeples is excellent, at times rather Kristen Stewart-like. Her mostly unsentimental performance sells the movie's unabashed sentiment, even \r\nwhen she and the girls are doting on the aforementioned robot, who carries several secrets within him and ultimately comes to seem like an E.T.-like figure. These girls live their lives on Instagram and Snapchat and take selfie pictures and videos of everything, but never for a moment are they presented as trivial people, nor is the authenticity of their emotion called into question because they lived their lives online. The movie takes their dreams and miseries seriously and gives even characters who have just one or two scenes (such as a parking lot attendant and a security guard) a personality. It's not a good film in terms of plot or tonal consistency, and it offers almost nothing in the way of true conflict, but it's always an observant and sincere movie, and occasionally a beautiful and deep one.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Censored Voices", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The first fifteen minutes or so of this documentary were not entirely fruitful ones for this reviewer. There\u2019s a darkened, artfully photographed room, with a now-old fashioned reel-to-reel tape recorder sitting on a table, and an interview subject, the Israeli writer Amos Oz, listening to words he recorded almost a half-century ago. The premise is not, to say the least, unpromising. Oz is a veteran of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, which, as a text at the film\u2019s very beginning asserts, represented \u201cthe birth of modern Israel.\u201d Shortly after his service in that war, Oz and a few other colleagues conducted kibbutz interviews with themselves and other veterans, interviews that, a related text informs, have never been made entirely public until now\u2014hence the movie\u2019s title. Avraham Shapira\u2019s book \u201cThe Seventh Day,\u201d published in Israel in 1967, was based on the material, and is credited as a primary source here; Shapira is also among the film\u2019s interviewees. Director Mor Loushy\u2019s strategy of interposing shots of the spinning reels of the tape recorder, the darkened faces of the interviewees as they listen to their younger selves, and archival footage (which, the movie carefully points out, is not of the interviewees) at first made me think the material might have been better off in book form; the approach felt simultaneously rote and a little arty.\u00a0 Advertisement \n But Loushy is resourceful, particularly as an editor, and the talking heads, even those not as internationally famous as the compassionate, articulate, and still-distressed Oz, are spectacularly compelling. A few popular victory songs from the era play over triumphant-looking footage of Israeli soldiers interacting with citizens, and one former serviceman remarks \u201cWe see ourselves as Macabees.\u201d But there\u2019s hollowness and a bitterness here, not just with almost fifty years\u2019 hindsight, but in the immediate reflections of the soldiers interviewed just weeks after the victories. It\u2019s no accident that the best-friend character in Ari Folman\u2019s \u201cWaltz With Bashir\u201d was the filmmaker\u2019s therapist, or that the therapy-themed TV series \u201cIn Treatment\u201d was based on an Israeli show. The Israelis are in the main an implacably self-examining people, and the army men interviewed here are for the most part secular Jews. One interviewee recalls the mother of a dead friend saying \u201c[Jerusalem\u2019s] Western Wall isn\u2019t worth [my son\u2019s] fingernail.\u201d Provisionally Zionists, they are tortured by the fact that their national self-determination\u2014their right to a homeland, such as it is\u2014is tied into religious conflicts, beliefs they themselves do not even hold. What, they wonder almost as soon at they\u2019re demobilized, are/were they fighting for? \u201cWe\u2019re not murderers, but in the war, we all became murderers,\u201d says one man, ruefully. \n Loushy\u2019s choice of archival footage reflects a Western media that chose to function as a pep squad for the Israeli project. Clipped British voices declaim that \u201cone can only admire the efficiency\u201d of the Israeli army led by charismatic, eyepatch-sporting Moshe Dayan, and quip, over a shot of an abandoned pair of loafers on a street, that an Israeli squadron \u201cleave[s] the Egyptians shoeless in Gaza.\u201d But late in the film, Loushy shows ABC News\u2019 Bob Young reporting from an Arab refugee camp in Amman, saying that there\u2019s nothing growing there except \u201cseeds of revenge,\u201d and it\u2019s chilling.\u00a0 \n If Israel is a country at all (and in my view, for what it\u2019s worth, it absolutely is) it is one that consistently has to come to terms with the paradoxes and contradictions that it's practically made of, something this trim and disquieting film brings home with what turns out to be great economy and force. \u201cA society that won\u2019t tell itself the truth [\u2026] is in big trouble,\u201d says one of the interviewees. The words have perhaps never been more true. And not just for Israel, as the movie implies.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "No Stone Unturned", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Ace documentary director Alex Gibney's \"No Stone Unturned\" is an investigation into the politically charged, unsolved 1994 Loughinisland massacre of June 18, 1994. Two gunmen clad in balaclavas and boiler suits walked into the Heights Bar, a small pub on a rural road, and opened fire, killing six men, the oldest of whom was 87. They had gathered to watch the World Cup broadcast live from New Jersey.  Context is everything here, and the best parts of \"No Stone Unturned\" allow Gibney to set this particular scene, offering what amounts to a high-octane history lesson charged with lingering trauma.  Ireland was playing. It was supposed to be a great unifying moment for a country that had been riven by The Troubles for over thirty years, pitting Catholics sympathetic to separatists and Protestants loyal to England, spilling Catholic and Protestant blood all over British-occupied Northern Ireland. Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams, who had been accused of being a high ranking member of the Irish Republican Army and who was sympathetic to their views, had been invited to the United States by then-President Bill Clinton, a move that was seen as a possible harbinger of lasting piece by some and a slap in the face by others. The second act of this compact film sprints through the specifics, setting the historic scene for us and giving Gibney a chance to show striking, often horrifying images from Northern Ireland's civil war, such as news footage of a bloody-faced man, wounded in a bombing, being led away from the scene by police, and a stark photograph of a masked gunman crouching behind a short wall on a city street while very young children look on from the sidewalk in the background. Advertisement There was, and still is, speculation that the massacre represented a bloody statement against any possibility of reconciliation between factions. In the years that followed, as leads went nowhere and justice for the survivors never arrived, there was evidence suggesting a cover-up by police colluding with loyalists. The gunmen's car\u2014which, to the delight of investigators had been left intact a few miles from the crime scene\u2014was destroyed by police years later without warning or reason. Twelve years after the killing, the partners and children of victims held a press conference expressing their frustration and anger at the lack of justice.  Gibney took a cool, investigatory view of scandals and conspiracies in such films as \"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,\" \"Taxi to the Dark Side\" and \"Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer.\" But he approaches this material in an uncharacteristically plugged in, heated way. He's taking it personally, and wants us to know he's taking it personally, no doubt because he grew close to individuals in the community near the crime scene while working on another project. We hear his off-screen voice asking questions and (unless my eye misleads me) see him pictured on camera. This is a righteous, at times angry movie. It wants to right a great wrong and bring peace to individuals who haven't been able to find any.   This is all sounds great in theory, but it turns to be dicey in practice. From the prologue, which recreates the massacre in the manner of a Hollywood action movie right down to the slow-motion, lavishly photographed closeups of guns firing and spent shell casings tumbling through the air, to the subsequent re-creations, to the pounding synth music and the other touches reminiscent of true-crime TV shows, \"No Stone Unturned\" at times veers close to a rant. It's clear that Gibney is going for something along the lines of Errol Morris' \"The Thin Blue Line,\" which also used stylized re-creations, but the pieces don't fit together as neatly here, and there's a fair amount of \"because I said so\" argumentation in the sections that put together lingering details and attempt to suggest possible suspects.  Advertisement And from there it lurches into territory that could be considered irresponsible. The picture of Northern Ireland bloodshed that's painted in this movie will make almost any viewer justifiably furious, but there's still something disquieting about the whiff of vigilantism that lingers over the final third. It's clear that the official sources tasked with solving this particular crime either failed due to incompetence or deliberately tanked it, but I'm not convinced that Gibney is necessarily the best replacement for them. And for all his facility with the more cliched elements of true-crime aesthetics, Errol Morris he ain't. The result is akin to hearing a charming but bitter man in a pub wax eloquent about a long-ago injustice, weaving a spell that has you nodding along in sympathy until he has a few too many and says, \"I've got a gun in my glove compartment. Let's take a drive.\"", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Red Obsession", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "When the CEOs and proprietors of the great wine chateaux in the Bordeaux region of France talk about what they do in \"Red Obsession,\" a new documentary directed by David Roach and Warwick Ross, they sound like poets and mystics. One says that you \"need to bring so much love to your vineyard.\" Standing amidst the vines, another says, \"There's a vibration here.\" One speaks of having a visceral sense of the history of the area, of the early ancestors who figured out the proper way to bring the grapes to fruition. Narrated by Russell Crowe, \"Red Obsession\" takes us through the background of the wine-producing capital of the world, its history, its dependence on capricious elements (like the weather, the global economy), and the challenges facing the area due to rising prices and crumbling markets.  Advertisement \"Red Obsession\" opens with an elegant tracking shot of a dark warehouse filled with wooden barrels, as Joss Stone moans \"I Put a Spell On You.\" It's sexy, a fitting opening for a film about obsession, about wine-mania, about people who live, breathe, eat, think, drink wine. The footage of Bordeaux is awe-inspiring, with aerial shots of the great chateaux and the vineyards. Closeups of the labels from the different chateaux abound, along with luscious shots of glimmering wine being poured. The obsessive nature of the entire industry is reflected in these shots, a good marriage of theme and form.  Through interviews with wine journalists and chateaux proprietors (including Francis Ford Coppola), we learn about the business, its ups and downs, its competitions. Journalists talk about how difficult it is to describe wine, even though it is their business to do so, and they too sound like poets or mystics. \"A wine is like a voice, an instrument with a timbre...\" The chateaux work with the journalists, holding wine-tastings of each new vintage, waiting for the verdict. The proprietors of the chateaux are clearly international businesspeople in one respect, but in another respect they are farmers, who understand that you have good years and bad years. Much is out of your control. The pressure is enormous to keep producing stellar wines, but when you are dealing with nature you cannot always guarantee the results. One of the real issues in recent years is that the prices of the bottles of wine have risen so astronomically that they have become too valuable to drink. People now buy bottles of wine as investments, rather than something to be shared at a special occasion.  The economic collapse of 2008 and 2009 has impacted the Bordeaux region in an immediate way. Americans stopped buying expensive wine en masse, and up until then America was the major market for Bordeaux wines. But another market has exploded, almost overnight, in China. The second half of the film is devoted to the wine-mania in China, the cutthroat wine auctions in Hong Kong, the entrepreneur (he made his fortune in sex toys) whose wine collection is worth 60 million US dollars.  Bordeaux wine-manufacturers may talk like poets and mystics but they are practical people of trade, and recognized that China was a new market with unlimited possibilities. The cities in China are shown with a frenetic speeded-up film, lights buzzing along the highways and glittering off and on in the skyscrapers, quite a different dynamic from the stately footage of Bordeaux. Wine is going for such high prices in China that the folks back in Bordeaux are concerned. The prices are becoming divorced from reality, a clear sign that a speculative bubble may be forming. This is a controversial issue, and the talking heads, Chinese and French, argue it out from across the globe.  Advertisement The narration is simply done, providing us with the necessary context to understand the interconnectedness of this world, its history, its reliance on weather, politics and trade agreements. Informative though it may be, \"Red Obsession\" is a moody and emotional piece of work. Clouds race over the French chateaux, clouds of change. Obsession keeps Bordeaux in business, but obsession can be unreliable. What happens if China loses its interest in wine and moves on to something else?  Coppola describes the experience of drinking a glass of Chateau Margaux that was bottled four years after the French Revolution. It was a profound experience. He wonders if Lafayette had had a glass of it. He wonders if maybe Thomas Jefferson, a famous wine-lover and wine-obsessive, had had a glass. The glass of wine connected Coppola to those earlier times. \"Wine tells a story,\" he says.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Carrie", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"What did Carrie White ever do to you?\" That question is asked more than once in \"Carrie,\" and it cuts to the heart of this new adaptation. Where Brian DePalma's 1976 version of Stephen King's novel was a teenage girl's nightmare as seen through the eyes of a straight male voyeur, this one looks through a wider lens, and strikes more universal notes of sympathy. (Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers ahead.)  This Carrie White (played by Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz of the \"Kick-Ass\" films) is more conventionally pretty than the scrawny, big-eyed misfit played by Sissy Spacek in DePalma's classic. Her gawkiness is internalized. It's a product of her horrid home life, and the knowledge that she has undefined powers that make her different from other kids, and that they're flowering along with the onset of puberty, and that her mother Margaret (Julianne Moore) sees them as signs of evil, rather than world-changing human potential. In this scenario it does not matter whether Carrie is conventionally \"pretty\" or \"not pretty.\"  Because Carrie is an abused child, she feels ugly; because she feels ugly, she radiates a sense of worthlessness.   Advertisement Carrie's body-shame was handed down by her mom, who's first seen in a prologue giving birth to Carrie, then briefly considering killing her with the same scissors she will ultimately use to cut the cord. (Peirce's staging of the birth\u2014complete with first-person shot of the infant's soft head resting on bloody sheets\u2014is original, and Moore's acting has a silent-movie purity.) In contrast to DePalma's version, Carrie's mom seems less a standard-issue, frothing-at-the-mouth \"religious nut\" movie character than a mentally ill single mom, eking out a living as a seamstress and dry cleaner. Moore's Margaret is a purely pitable figure who scratches and cuts her own flesh, and who cannot love herself, let alone a child. As far as Carrie knows, this is a normal home life.   For all the psychological realism of Carrie and Margaret's relationship, however, this remake has a comic book feeling. Peirce has turned \"Carrie\" into dark, sick take on a superhero origin story, complete with wide-angle lenses and God's-eye-view shots and poetic sound effects (when Margaret is near, Carrie \"hears\" her before she sees her, thanks to a high-pitched whine that's like a dog whistle). Whole sequences have a Clark-Kent-in-Smallville feeling. What would have become of Superman had he been a girl raised by an insane single parent? He'd might have endured being called a freak for years until he finally snapped and roasted the football team. The film treats the school's gym teacher Miss Desjardin (Judy Greer)\u2014who punishes Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday), leader of the girls who torture Carrie\u2014as Carrie's shadow \"good\" mother. Her kindness is a heartening alternative to Margaret's paranoia, unthinking cruelty, and emotional dislocation. When Carrie spares Miss Desjardin from the prom rampage, lifting her off a dance floor that she's about to fill with corpses, it's one of the most perversely touching gestures in a movie filled with them. Advertisement Perhaps because this \"Carrie\" is helmed by one of the only prominent female directors in Hollywood, Kimberly Peirce (\"Boys Don't Cry\"), it appreciates Carrie and her mother and the heroine's various female adversaries as women, and portrays their brand of cruelty as specifically female. For example, where the girls in the 1976 \"Carrie\" tormented the menstruating heroine in the shower in a wolf-pack manner, as teenaged boys might attack another teenage boy, the shower attack in this film is a joke that originates in embarrassment and nausea, then snowballs. (Peirce doesn't show nudity; this time it's all about the girls' emotions.)\u00a0 Peirce and screenwriters Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa give the whole film this kind of heartfelt, inside-out re-imagining. Class differences play a part in Carrie's mistreatment; a few early shots establish that Carrie and Margaret live far from the obviously privileged high school, in a modest neighborhood. And as the tale nears its inevitable climax, the tone becomes more despairing. Nothing can stop what's coming. It's on this last point, though, that \"Carrie\" falters most conspicuously\u2014and ironically, its failure is a product of its decision to depart from the novel and the first film, but without going far enough. Peirce's version sometimes makes Chris seem a bit of a victim, too, by implying that she was spoiled rotten by her yuppie dad\u2014played by a perfectly cast Hart Bochner, a.k.a. Ellis from \"Die Hard.\" This is a good impulse, but the movie doesn't properly follow through on it. The script has Chris be exaggeratedly \"evil\" when it serves the plot, but life-sized elsewhere.\u00a0This version strands the supporting characters between realism and archetype, an awkward spot.\u00a0 Still, there's a lot to like in this remake. It's sincerely interested in exploring the pain that its characters suffer and inflict. And when Carrie unleashes the full brunt of her powers, it's a magnificent and appalling spectacle\u2014the teenage sci-fi rampage that the \"X-Men\" films never dared show us.  Not for nothing does Carrie check out library books on magic as well as paranormal power: when she becomes a gore-drenched avenging angel, her gestures become more ritualized, almost dancer-like\u2014as if she's not just committing gruesome murders, but in some sense \"presenting\" them, as a performer might. The movie links Carrie's burgeoning power to creativity, watching her develop her gifts until, at the end, she is assured enough to preside over a combination Grand Guignol play and art exhibit. The prom is a masterpiece of mixed-media slaughter, \"Hellraiser\" by way of Columbine. Each killing is a discrete work employing different media and techniques: death by psychic assault, by trampling, by electrocution, by fire, by face-through-glass. As Walter Chaw writes, \"Peirce's Carrie does something DePalma's doesn't do nearly so well: it describes Carrie's headspace, so that her telekinesis becomes expressionistic.\"   Advertisement Curiously, for such a secular movie, this \"Carrie\" lends Biblical significance to every blood drop spilled. Original sin is never far from its mind. Margaret's original sin was having sex with Carrie's father, an event she describes as a violation. The community's original sin was attacking Carrie in the shower, humiliating her for manifesting signs of Eve's \"curse.\" After that, they were thrown out of the garden of their innocence, or ignorance; each counterplot or attempt to make amends is a doomed attempt to return to the garden. Carrie's original sin was being born. She is born again at the prom, kills the woman who gave birth to her, and dies that very night. The first \"Carrie\" was horror. This is tragedy.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Identical", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "On January 8, 1935, a woman gave birth to twin boys in a little shack built by her husband in Tupelo, Mississippi. It is not known whether or not the twins were identical. One twin was stillborn, the other grew up to be Elvis Presley. \u00a0For the entirety of his life, Elvis missed his twin (named Jesse). He prayed to him, talked about him all the time. If you visit Graceland, there is a small gravestone for Jesse in the family burial plot outside the house. Elvis wondered if he had somehow sapped the strength of his twin brother in the womb, and if that was why he became the superstar that he did. He had guilt about it. \"The Identical,\" an extremely strange, confused, and bad film, directed by first-timer Dustin Marcellino, and written by Howard Klausner, is an alternate-history riff on these ideas. The twins here are named Ryan and Drexel Hemsley (both played by Blake Rayne, an Elvis impersonator.) \"The Identical\" asks a series of questions: what if the twin had lived? What if the Jesse-twin had been given away by his parents because they were too poor to take care of him? What if the twins grew up not knowing about each other? What if the Jesse-twin also had a hankering to make music? What if he watched as his doppelg\u00e4nger took the world by storm?\u00a0 Advertisement The question I have is how the cringe-worthy music in the film, supposed to signify the birth of rock 'n' roll, could ever have taken any world by storm? The music in \"The Identical\" is what it would be like if Elvis skipped the rhythm 'n blues part of his influence and went straight to pop-lite power ballads. There is no sense in the film's music of Elvis' country and western roots or his love of gospel and there are none of the various intersecting influences that made Elvis' early recordings so genre-bending and revolutionary. All we have in \"The Identical\" are songs that make you feel like you've stepped into a community theatre production of \"Footloose\" mixed with \"Les Miserables.\" And we are meant to believe that the entire culture changed because of the music heard in \"The Identical.\"\u00a0 The film starts with a black-and-white flashback, showing a Depression-era cotton-picking husband and wife (Brian Geraghty and Amanda Crew), agonizing over how they will take care of their newborns. One night, the father stumbles into a tent-revival, and watches as the preacher (Ray Liotta) gives an impassioned sermon, talking about how it is better to give than to receive, and admitting to the sympathetic crowd that he and his wife (Ashley Judd) have been unable to have children. The father, watching from the back, gets an idea. If it is better to give than to receive, and if that nice godly couple wanted a child and couldn't have one, then maybe they could give one of the twins to them? And that is exactly what happens. It is agreed that the children will not be told of one another.\u00a0 Instead of following the rise of Drexel \"The Dream\" Hemsley to the top of the charts, we instead stay with Ryan, the twin who was handed over to the preacher. At an early age, the boy shows a gift for music, singing in the church choir, and his adoptive father thinks that God has called him to the ministry. Ryan loves God, does what his father says, attends seminary, but sneaks out of the house at night to attend music shows at fully-integrated (despite the fact that this takes place in Alabama in the 1940s) honky tonks and roadhouses. Something is happening in music! He wants in on it! One night he takes the stage and sings an horrific song called \"Boogie Woogie Rock 'n' Roll\" and the place goes wild! But how will he tell his father he doesn't want to be a preacher? Advertisement People stop Ryan on the street, asking him if he's related to the new superstar. Everyone mentions the uncanny resemblance. But Ryan doesn't say to himself, \"It's not just an uncanny resemblance. We look exactly alike, we're even played by the same guy. What's going on here?\" There are only brief glimpses of Drexel Hemsley, riding on his private jet, dressed like Stevie Ray Vaughn, drinking high-end Scotch out of a glass tumbler, hands festooned with gigantic turquoise rings.\u00a0 The real theme of the story appears to be that God has a plan for all of us, and we are meant to answer God's call, whether that means being a preacher or being a rock star (or, in the case of Ryan, the very first Drexel Hemsley impersonator, billed as \"The Identical.\") Ryan doesn't want to just make a living imitating someone else though. He wants to perform his own stuff! He has written a song called \"City Lights,\" a ballad that sounds like a Michael Bolton dirge, and everyone rants and raves over how it is a hit. Why won't the team who manages his impersonator career let him perform it at his shows?\u00a0 The music is so terrible and it is such a focal point of the film that it was difficult to get past it. Blake Rayne is fine in the acting portion of the role, if a little stiff. When he gets onstage, though, and audiences go crazy in response, it is impossible to see what they are seeing. The moves, the Elvis bumps and grinds, are indicated by Rayne rather than inhabited fully, and it repeatedly points out the gap between what we are seeing onscreen and the extraordinary level of Elvis' commitment to his performance style. In his famous 1977 Village Voice obituary for Elvis, Lester Bangs wrote about seeing Elvis in concert: \"he had but to ever so slightly move one shoulder muscle, not even a shrug, and the girls in the gallery hit by its ray screamed, fainted, howled in heat. Literally, every time this man moved any part of his body the slightest centimeter, tens or tens of thousands of people went berserk.\" That's the reality. That's what happened. \"The Identical\" wants us to pretend that what we are seeing onscreen is akin to what Lester Bangs described. The quote, \"Who you gonna believe? Me or your lyin' eyes?\" comes to mind. Ray Liotta and Ashley Judd somehow turn in beautifully-layered funny and human performances, a minor miracle all things considered. Ray Liotta's preacher is not a fire-and-brimstone guy. He is thoughtful and loving and truly believes his adopted son has a calling in the ministry. He is pained at Ryan's deceptions, and pained that his son seems lost. Liotta manages to bring this envelope-thin character to full three-dimensional life. Judd (whose mother, Naomi Judd, interestingly enough, married Larry Strickland, a member of The Stamps quartet, Elvis' regular gospel backup group throughout the 1970s), is excellent as well.\u00a0 Advertisement Marcellino is competent as a director, and the visuals are fine. There are nice period details throughout (although the vintage cars lining the streets gleam in mint condition, making the atmosphere kitschy rather than authentic).\u00a0 It is fascinating to contemplate that one of the biggest stars of the 20th century had a twin. \"The Identical\" tries to explore that, sort of, but there's too much bad music drowning everything else out.\u00a0 One positive thing about \"The Identical\" is that it will make you want to bust out Elvis Presley's early Sun and RCA recordings, songs like \"That's All Right,\" \"Lawdy Miss Clawdy,\" \"My Baby Left Me,\" or \"Good Rockin'\" just to remind you that no, it didn't happen the way it did in \"The Identical\".

{"Title": "Alien Abduction", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The found-footage trend shows no signs of dying out any time soon, and much of it is tiresome, but director Matty Beckerman has given us a creepy and energetic found-footage thriller with \"Alien Abduction,\" the story of a family of campers hunted down by hostile alien creatures through the woods of Black Mountain, North Carolina.  The film has, as its real-life hook, the phenomenon of the \"Brown Mountain Lights,\" which has launched an atmosphere of speculation and conspiracy theories, straight from the Paranormal Playbook. \"Everybody up here knows something weird's going on,\" says Sean (Jeff Bowser), a backwoods guy in \"Alien Abduction\" who lives in an unheated shack in the Brown Mountain woods. Lights are seen moving in strange geometric patterns above the mountains. There are multiple mysterious disappearances every year. It is thought that the lights are somehow connected to the disappearances.  Advertisement  \"Alien Abduction\" opens like a documentary, showing interviews with physicists and paranormal researchers, who all say that the Brown Mountain Lights cannot be explained, and the situation surely warrants more research. The footage of the film is said to be \"leaked\" from the U.S. Air Force, whose creation of Project Blue Book in 1952 helped form the paranoid atmosphere on Brown Mountain. Project Blue Book was set up to analyze UFO data and ascertain whether or not UFOs (if they existed) posed any threat to national security. \u00a0The problem with a lot of found-footage films is the amount of disbelief one needs to suspend in order to accept that people would keep filming through hair-raising moments of terror. Put the camera down and run for your lives! In \"Alien Abduction,\" the camera is in the hands of Riley Morris (Riley Polanski), an 11-year-old autistic boy, who films everything in his life because it helps him engage with the world. The device is a bit too neat, not to mention reductive, but it works.   The Morris family, parents and three kids, are on a family camping trip. The mood in the car is jovial. On their first night camping, the three kids look up and see strange lights moving in the night sky. The lights move in tandem in a triangular formation, before jutting off at right angles. Those are no stars.   Things get distinctly creepier the following day, and the panicked family find refuge in the cabin of Sean, the backwoods guy. At first it seems that Sean may have strolled right out of \"Deliverance,\" showing resentment about the city folk who come up here to his mountain, but he becomes an important and even heroic figure. The eldest son, a teenager named Corey (Corey Eid), has a small character arc that gives us an emotional pay-off. \"Alien Abduction\" even takes the time to give us a quiet and beautiful shot of Sean and Corey sitting on the front porch of the shack, waiting, staring out into the green forest, rifles cocked and ready. The alien encroachment is suggested by swooping white high-beams appearing in the windows, the blinding light seeping through the cracks in the walls, pouring down through the floorboards. It's old-fashioned terror, and less is definitely more. There is one long shot of a country road covered in dead crows that is hair-raising in its eerie and awful simplicity. Beckerman intersperses the footage with static, loud and jagged, and the couple of \"effects\" included are quick and dirty. If you're going to go the found-footage route, you might as well try to find a new way to approach the material. Beckerman has. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Winter's Tale", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Adapting a well-loved book for the screen is always a risky proposition. Elements that work on the page will not work visually and vice versa. Compromises must be made. You cannot please everyone. But the film version of \"Winter's Tale\" probably won't\u00a0please anyone: neither fans of the book nor those who have never read it. It lacks visual splendor (except for one or two scenes). It lacks emotional depth. It lacks scope and magic. It is clear that there is some big battle going on between Good and Evil and that Will Smith is somehow involved, but none of it makes any sense. The philosophical underpinnings of the novel, its thoughts on the turning of the centuries (and the millennium), and how cultures and societies go through giant upheaval during such moments, visible, and invisible, is completely lost in the New Age-y dreck drenching the narrative. Not even Colin Farrell as the thief Peter Lake can save it, and he is doing his level best, with an urgent, heartfelt performance. Mark Helprin's 1983 novel is one of the most poetic of the late 20th century, and yet this film version has no poetry whatsoever. Advertisement The opening of the film flies us around through time, from the 1890s to 2014, with Colin Farrell in both eras. It is a clue that we are not entering a realistic world, but it's so shoddily constructed that it's never entirely clear what you're supposed to be looking at. In the 1890s, a thief named Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) is on the run from his former boss, a scarred monster named Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe, who seems totally adrift in this performance, hoping that a facial tic will somehow translate as menacing). Soames' black-derbied \"droogs\" chase Peter Lake through the Bowery, and Lake escapes via a nearby white horse who magically sprouts wings and flies over a locked gate. The visual effects are more My Pretty Pony than anything else.  Lake, who must get out of Manhattan to escape Soames, breaks into a Central Park West mansion to rob the joint before fleeing town. There, he comes across Beverly Penn (\"Downton Abbey\"'s Jessica Brown Findlay) in her nightgown, playing Brahms. She is a consumptive heiress with only six months to live. Her body temperature runs so high that she sleeps in a tent on the roof of the mansion, hoping that the cold air will cool her down. Beverly makes a cup of tea for the thief, and the two characters from two different worlds sit in the kitchen, talk, and fall in love.  Peter becomes convinced that he can find a way to save Beverly, and he thinks that maybe the magical white horse (now his partner-in-crime) might be able to help. He joins the Penn family in their winter retreat up the Hudson River, and passes muster with Beverly's stern father (William Hurt). Meanwhile, Pearly Soames is on his trail, but through some dark magic is not allowed to leave the boroughs of New York. He goes to request a weekend pass, basically, from the \"Judge\" (Will Smith), a guy with earrings lounging in a bed in a subterranean dungeon. The scene that follows between the two of them, in which they suddenly turn into snarling, snapping demons, is incomprehensible.\u00a0 Advertisement This is par for the course, I'm afraid. I read the book and I often had no idea what was going on in the movie, except that the growing love between Peter and Beverly is somehow threatening to the status quo and Pearly Soames must stop it. I think.  The current-day sections of the film feature Peter Lake, somehow transported\u00a0to 2014, wandering around Manhattan with no memory. He comes across a kindly woman (Jennifer Connelly) who wants to help him. One might think she had other things on her mind, such her young daughter, who's dying of cancer. Peter Lake also whisks away the dying child on the winged My Pretty Pony, and then there's a scene where he has a huge fist fight with Pearly Soames on the frozen ice of the Hudson while Jennifer Connelly sobs over to the side clutching her dying daughter. Situations that should be touching become laughable.\u00a0 Eva Marie Saint shows up in the 2014 section as a newspaper mogul. She has a breathtaking moment where she holds her arms out to Peter Lake. It is a beautiful reminder of her stature in American films. Her presence almost justifies the film's existence. Almost. The romance between Beverly and Peter is the only well-done plot line. This is entirely due to Farrell and Findlay. Farrell makes the love story work. He is sincere. He makes the hero's pain at Beverly's illness palpable. When they finally make love in a tent on the roof, their passion has an emotional undercurrent that makes the sex scene about something other than sex. They connect. There is a sadness in their connection, due to the shared knowledge that it will be short-lived.  In her review of the novel, Barbara J. King describes the book as a \"maelstrom-between-two-covers.\" and anyone who has loved the source material would probably agree. In the film, the maelstrom is gone, turned explicit and narrow. The novel has a passionate fan base and I (obviously) count myself among them. Akiva Goldsman, who wrote the screenplays for \"I Am Legend\" and \"Angels and Demons\", to name just two, adapted the book as well as directing the film. He's made a mess of it. There are a couple of beautiful images (the glowing consumption tents on the top of mansions, the frozen-over Hudson, the nighttime stroll through the snowy forest), but there is no underlying story, there is no narrative thrust, magical or otherwise.  Advertisement \"Winter's Tale\" tells the story of a thief, a consumptive heiress, and a sentient magical white horse, but, really, it is the story of New York City in Helprin's imagination, a place like the one in reality but with some strange alterations. The Hudson freezes solid for miles, and people set up tent cities along the ice. There is a frozen magical town up-river where time takes on strange qualities. There is a whirling mysterious white cloud-wall that surrounds the island of Manhattan, a cloud-wall that everyone accepts to such a degree that no one notices it anymore. What is the cloud-wall? What does it signify? The wall is gone in Goldsman's version. In the book, it is the whole point\u2014the reason for everything. Goldsman has missed the point of the book entirely. One leaves the novel reluctantly. One leaves the film with great relief that it is over.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The 15:17 to Paris", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "On August 21, 2015, three Americans traveling through Europe subdued a terrorist who tried to kill passengers on the Thalys train #9364 bound for Paris. The men were Airman First Class Spencer Stone, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and college student Anthony Sadler. They'd been friends since childhood. The gunman, a Morrocan named Ayoub El Khazzani, exited a washroom strapped with weapons, wrestled with a couple of would-be heroes, and shot one of them in the neck with a pistol. Stone tackled Khazzani and locked him in a choke hold while being repeatedly sliced with a knife. Stone's two friends plus Chris Norman, a 62-year-old British businessman living in France, hit Khazzani with their fists and with the butts of firearms that he'd dropped into the struggle until he finally lost consciousness. Then they kept the shooting victim alive until the train was able to stop and let police and emergency medical technicians onboard. For their bravery, Norman, Sadler, Skarlatos, and Stone were made Knights of the Legion of Honour\u00a0by French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and given awards, parades, and talk show appearances back home.\u00a0  Advertisement As Hollywood film fodder, this is\u2014or should have been\u2014a slam dunk, even for a director who insisted on having the three Americans play themselves, which is the case here. To call Clint Eastwood's \"The 15:17 to Paris\" a mixed bag would be generous. It packs all the wild action you came to see into a 20-minute stretch near the end, and elsewhere gives us something like a platonic buddy version of Richard Linklater's \"Before\" trilogy. This is an audacious choice regardless of whether you're into it.  Too bad seeing this trio re-enact their European vacation is as absorbing as watching a friend's video footage of a trip you didn't go on. As cinematographer Tom Stern's camera hangs close-but-not-too-close, Sadler, Stone and Skarlatos retrace their steps, traveling from Rome and Venice to Berlin and Amsterdam, cracking jokes about old buildings and sculptures, flirting with attractive women, getting liquored up in a nightclub. You feel like you're right there alongside them. This is an eerie and astonishing feeling when they're re-enacting the train incident, but not when they're ordering food or taking selfies.  There's a long tradition of real people starring in films about their lives, from Pancho Villa and Jackie Robinson to Muhammad Ali and Howard Stern, and some film cultures, particularly Italy's Neorealism and Iran's post-1980s docudramas, have a proud history of extraordinary nonprofessional performances.  World War II Medal of Honor winner Audie Murphy went straight into acting with help from a famous admirer, James Cagney, played himself in 1955's \"To Hell and Back,\" based on his same-titled memoir, and died 21 years later with 50 screen credits. There haven't been too many instances where audiences looked at these performances and thought, \"Wow, what an incredible actor\u2014a professional wouldn't have added anything.\" But if the nonprofessional seems relatively comfortable onscreen and lets a bit of personality come through, the film can work. And the performance might be likable. Or at least not painful.  Advertisement I'm relieved to report that not only are these three less than terrible in their big screen debuts, they're kind of charming, once you decide to make peace with the fact that Eastwood has traded the depth and nuance that a professional can bring for the unpredictable freshness you can only get from casting newcomers. Stone is an unexpectedly striking screen presence: a towering, broad-shouldered, lethal goofball with a comic book henchman's jawline and a bubbly, impatient manner of speaking. There are moments when his rat-a-tat delivery, practically tripping over his own words, suggests an unholy fusion of Drew Carey and young Gary Busey. I wouldn't be surprised to see him wind up on a sitcom opposite Tim Allen or Kevin James. The other two seem to have been granted screen time in proportion to their not-terribleness. We get a lot of Stone with Sadler, who's not a particularly deep actor, to put it mildly, but is disarmingly natural and has a great rapport with his pal. Skarlatos, a handsome but wooden nice guy, is kept mostly offscreen until he joins the others.\u00a0  But no matter what you think of these men as thespians, their performances are the least of the film's problems. A good 70% of \"The 15:17 to Paris\" is inert, its affable nothingness redeemed only by the laid-back charisma of three men who once again find themselves in extraordinary circumstances and have no choice but to rise to the occasion.  The film starts with a flashback to the trio's childhood, with Jenna Fischer and Judy Greer as Skarlatos and Stone's mothers, that promises an American Fighting Man Epic in the vein of \"Sergeant York\" or \"Hacksaw Ridge.\" But these scenes fall almost entirely flat, with character traits being more described than dramatized. The scene where the moms argue with a snotty administrator who tries to diagnose Stone with ADHD while dissing both women for being single mothers might be the worst five minutes Eastwood has put onscreen, but it has lots of competition here. How Eastwood managed to get worse performances out of the professional actors playing the young heroes than the adults who'd never acted is a mystery that only another director can properly unravel. Ace character actors Tony Hale and Thomas Lennon are wasted as, respectively, the school's principal and gym coach. Jaleel White is given just one scene to convince us that he's a great teacher who inspired the boys' interest in history; it lasts about 60\u00a0seconds and ends with him handing them a manila folder full of maps. The moms mention God occasionally, but usually in a stilted way, and their families' spiritual lives aren't examined in any detail (though there are a couple of prayers in the film, which is rare for a Hollywood movie).  The screenplay, adapted by Dorothy Blyskal from a book co-written by the trio plus Jeffrey E. Stern, is often painfully awkward and obvious. Earnest discussions  of fate and destiny are shoehorned into shallow but generally likeable (and seemingly improvised) scenes of the guys talking to each other, and to people they meet during their journey. A couple of the latter are so odd that they verge on sublime, like the bit when an old man at a bar talks them into going to Amsterdam by recounting the illicit good time he just had there.  Advertisement But for the most part, \"The 15:17 to Paris\" is a study in misplaced priorities. While the re-enactment of the incident on the train is superb\u2014Eastwood has always had a flair for staging unfussy yet shockingly brutal screen violence\u2014I'd have happily traded the lead-up hour of marshmallow fluffery for scenes that showed what happened to the guys once they got back to their home country and were treated like gods on earth (though, in fairness, Eastwood might've figured he told that story already in \u201cFlags of Our Fathers\u201d). And there are some groaner choices, like Eastwood's refusal to age Fischer and Greer for their scenes opposite their now-grownup sons, which makes it seem as if they had them when they were 12; the near-omission of Sadler's parents from the narrative, which inadvertently turns a co-equal lead character into The Black Friend; and the way Eastwood keeps the terrorist literally faceless during his first few flashback appearances, by focusing on his hands, his feet, his knapsack and wheeled suitcase, and the back of his neck.  I've read that Eastwood asked the French government if he could get Khazzani to play himself, too, but was refused. Is this why he portrayed him as a non-person\u2014just another Bad Thing happening to Good People? I wanted to know how Khazzani ended up on that train as well\u2014not because he deserves any sympathy (he doesn't) but because his is also a tale of social conditioning and sheer willpower, and might have reflected off the main trio's story in\u00a0 illuminating ways. For an example of how to do this in a thoughtful, responsible manner, see Anurag Kashyap's 2007 film \"Black Friday,\" which retold the same bombing from the point-of-view of the terrorists and the police, in two different halves. Eastwood did something similar with \"Flags of Our Fathers\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima.\" But for the most part, he has become increasingly uninterested in that kind of complexity, despite having devoted the first 20-plus years of his directing career to letting us see the evil in good people, and the good in the evil.  While there's something innately inspiring about Eastwood continuing to crank out films 48 years into his directing career, there's a downside: his batting average has never been terrific, and his game has slipped a lot since the Iwo Jima films. There are intriguing aspects to nearly all of his films, but he's only made maybe six or seven that are excellent from start to finish\u2014even the mostly good ones have bad scenes and sections\u2014and in the last 20 years, even his good work has included a lot of ill-considered, amateurish, or flat-out baffling elements, like the screechingly caricatured parents in \"Million Dollar Baby,\" and Chris Kyle doting on an obviously fake infant in \"American Sniper.\" Eastwood is famous for working fast and bringing his movies in on time and under budget, and \"The 15:17 to Paris\" is another example of that legendary efficiency: supposedly he decided to tell the trio's story after giving them a Spike TV Guys' Choice Award just 19 months ago. But breeziness is not, in itself, an unassailable virtue. There hasn't been a single Eastwood film since \"Unforgiven\" that couldn't have benefited from script rewrites, plus a few trusted advisors with the nerve to tell him that a particular choice was ill-advised. (I know, I know\u2014who wants to tell Clint Eastwood he's wrong? Nobody who's seen him use a hickory stick in \"Pale Rider,\" for starters.)  Advertisement The movie's greatest virtue, which might be enough to make it a critic-proof hit no matter what, is its poker faced sincerity. This extends to faithfully reproducing a Red State worldview that was also showcased in \"American Sniper\" and \"Sully.\" A lot of U.S. moviegoers are going to feel seen by this film, and that's a net gain for American cinema, which is supposed to be a populist art form representing the body politic as it is, not merely as the industry wishes it could be. If only someone could've heroically intervened to save this movie.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Beyond Outrage", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Outlasting everyone is the best revenge these days,\" a cop tells a gangster in Takeshi Kitano's 2010 gangster thriller \"Outrage.\" Maybe, if you're a gangster; but if you're a moviegoer, the best revenge is revenge. Audiences don't buy tickets to yakuza thrillers hoping for sensitive pacifist statements. They want to see more of what Kitano has given them in so many Japanese crime thrillers: betrayals and retributions marked by punitive violence so cruel that when the film cuts away from it, it's as if Kitano has shielded your eyes for you.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Outrage\" was a banquet of suffering. Signature dishes included a slashed face, a half-bitten tongue, anesthesia-free dentistry, chopsticks through the ear, and severed fingers in noodle soup. \"Beyond Outrage\" doesn't really go \"beyond\" in any sense except pushing the story a bit further. There are gruesome acts of violence, including a torture-by-drill, but for the most part Kitano seems content to expand on one of his biggest hits by taking a page or two from Francis Coppola's \"Godfather\" trilogy.\u00a0 The original was a closed-off suspense picture about men in suits plotting death and disfigurement in Rembrandt-lit boardrooms, restaurants and nightclubs. The gore was somewhat intertwined with a cop corruption subplot (represented by\u00a0Fumiyo Kohinata's Detective Kataoka, who did favors for one of the warring clans), but for the most part\u2014as in \"The Godfather\"\u2014what happened in the underworld stayed in the underworld. In \"Beyond Outrage,\" which is set five years after the bloody coup that ended the first film, the violence has spilled out in to the wider world, a la the second and third \"Godfather\" pictures.\u00a0 The\u00a0new Grand Yakuza leader of the Sanno-Kai syndicate, Kato (Tomokazu Miura), has raised the family's profile and profit margins. The family is doing business with the national government so openly that it doesn't hesitate to kill a troublesome police detective and his nightclub hostess girlfriend (a go-between for the gangsters and cops) and dump them in a river. Kato and his lieutenant and chief financial officer\u00a0Ishihara (Ryo Case) have promoted younger family members over older, more traditional gangsters, partly to protect themselves against counter-plots by people who rightly suspect that they murdered their predecessors. The new bosses order young and old gangsters alike to learn a new, white-collar way of making money. There's talk of stocks and hedge funds, and references to the family's prostitution business going global.\u00a0 Advertisement The police department orders the cop Kataoka to come up with a plan to neuter the syndicate. It's here that we start to notice the film's narrative gears creaking a bit. We learn that Kataoka was playing a \"long con\" back in the first film and was never truly corrupt (though he did get too chummy with the people he was fooling) and that Kitano's character, the haggard footsoldier Otomo, wasn't killed behind bars at the end, but survived his shanking. \"You started a rumor that I was dead,\" Otomo tells Kataoka. This is a bit too much like comic book or bad-TV storytelling: declaring, \"Pay no mind to what you thought you knew\" because it's the only way to tell the story you want to tell.\u00a0 Here, that story is \"Takeshi Kitano kills a bunch of people.\" Granted, that's the story Kitano has told many times before, often superbly, particularly in such classics as \"Sonatine\" and \"Fireworks\" and \"Brother,\" which are the closest thing to classic Clint Eastwood vehicles as Japanese popular cinema has produced. Like Eastwood's gangster and cop films, Kitano's crime thrillers know how to have their cake and eat it, too. They critique the mentality of macho, prideful, violent men operating in a world largely devoid of women, while at the same time giving the films' overwhelmingly male audiences the tribal carnage they want. The attitude is, \"Crime doesn't pay and revenge is futile, and in case you didn't get that, here's some more crime and revenge.\" There are marvelous satirical touches in Kitano's yakuza thrillers. They crystallize the idea that, as in the \"Godfather\" films and Martin Scorsese's gangster pictures, you're seeing colorful metaphors for business in general, and for an old way of life being supplanted by a new one. The first half-hour of \"Beyond Outrage\" is an elegant and bleak comedy that finds murderous gangsters griping about workplace politics, and features some of Kitano's strongest filmmaking. As always, Kitano displays a fine eye and ear for the details of protocol. When Otomo hooks up with an old adversary from a rival crime family in \"Outrage\"\u2014Hideo Nakano's Kimura, whose face Otomo slashed with a razor\u2014the man gifts Otomo with two godsons who are supposed to protect him, but are so incompetent that Otomo can barely protect them. Otomo can't turn the young fools away because it would be an insult, just as it would be insulting to turn away a prostitute given to him by an Osaka crime boss. (The prostitute shows him her bare back before leaving, so that he can describe her gang tattoos and make it seem as though they slept together.) There are many jokes at the expense of the the new Sanno-Kai crime boss' tone-deafness and cheapness.\u00a0\u00a0\"No meal served at an executive meeting, damn,\" an old foot soldier mutters. You get the feeling that if Kato had better people skills, his underlings might not be in such a hurry to expose his past treachery. Sometimes the difference between conspiracy and contentment is a nice lunch. Advertisement Unfortunately, early hints that the the actor-filmmaker's latest will be a brilliant, bloody, sustained workplace satire don't pan out. This is an intelligently composed, crisply edited, sometimes amusing, but otherwise unremarkable cross/double cross gangster picture. It seems as though it wants to be a Japanese \"The Godfather, Part II,\" but it takes too long to get going, expends too way much screen time setting up Kitano's character as a resurrected revenge-seeker/fly-in-the-ointment, and suffers from a jumbled and somewhat perfunctory second half. (Kitano, who's normally aces at laying out politically complex gangster plots, compresses a mob war into a series of mass murder tableaus, as if he's growing bored and just wants to get it all over with.) \"Beyond Outrage\" is worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre, or of Kitano specifically, though, and some of the lines are quotable in that \"Godfather\" way. \"You can never really know what the other guy is thinking,\" one character says, \"even if he's an obedient servant with a friendly smile.\"", "Critic": "Delta"}

In the U.S., Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin proved mere counterculture showmen even after they took important free-speech stances in the wake of the riots at Chicago\u2019s Democratic National Convention. Advertisement In the 21st\u00a0century, the ostensible revolutionary has ostensibly loosed himself from the shackles of right or left wing ideology\u2014although as we have seen, or shall see, a lot of these figures are fascists in anarchist clothing. Directed by Adam Bhala Lough, \u201cThe New Radical\u201d begins with a profile of Cody Wilson, a Millennial who invented a 3D-printable gun he cheekily called \u201cThe Liberator.\u201d On a clip from some show on Glenn Beck\u2019s media platform \u201cThe Blaze,\u201d Beck asks the youthful, occasionally beardo-ish bro Wilson, \u201cAre you a hero or a villain?\u201d To which Wilson replies, \u201cGood question.\u201d Much is made throughout the movie of Wilson\u2019s prodigious intellect. \u201cMy mother and father met in the same county,\u201d he wistfully recalls, before revealing his father was, besides being a pastor, a professor of hermeneutics. Wilson cites John Milton\u2019s Arepoditica\u00a0as a touchstone text in the development of his PHILOSOPHY OF FREEDOM, and tells cool stories containing passages like \u201cExam week was here and the State Department shut me down.\u201d He casually drops apercus like \u201cInformation should be free. And it wants to be.\u201d He shares heaviness like \u201cWikileaks was about showing that the Internet is the only game in town.\u201d Faced again with the hero-or-villain question, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t like the dichotomy. Whose conception? What paradigm?\u201d There\u2019s nothing intellectually intimidating, or even impressive, about Wilson. The fancy word for his rhetorical practice is \u201csophistry.\u201d The unfancy word for it is \u201cbulls**t.\u201d He\u2019s what Tucker Max would have been had Max inexplicably decided that firearms and anarchism were more fun than various combinations of women and booze. When he complains that the attentions that his work has garnered have upset his parents, the only reasonable response is, \u201ctoo bad, bro.\u201d When some talking head lawyer evinces concern that if convicted of violating certain regulations, Wilson would end up in a less than pleasant prison, one says, \u201cGOOD.\u201d (As of this writing he walks the earth a free man, and a co-founder of a website called \u201cHatreon.\u201d) This movie is reasonably well directed by Adam Bhala Lough, but it\u2019s far too dependent on and indulgent of its subjects, who also include Amir Taaki, a mouthy British Bitcoin evangelical who teams up with Wilson on a project called \u201cDark Wallet\u201d (these guys and their projects are way too dependent on comic book imagery). There\u2019s a lot of talking head footage of Julian Assange, who, we ought not forget, is holed up in an embassy because of his disinclination to face rape charges. Every time his oily voice came over the soundtrack, I felt sick. The movie also falls back on a lot of boogity-boogity docu-clich\u00e9s. Skittery editing, ironic music cues, that sort of thing. While he pointedly intercuts Wilson\u2019s whining with accounts of mass shootings over the United States contemporaneous with Wilson\u2019s battle to keep the government\u2019s hands off his 3D printed gun, it\u2019s not enough. In the end, this is a scary movie about scary people that\u2019s too much in bed with these people, in the manner of a \u201cNazi Next Door\u201d newspaper feature article. Going back to Mao, the Chinese dictator once said, \u201cPolitical power begins at the barrel of a gun.\u201d I reckon Cory Wilson has heard this adage, but I wonder how well he really understands it.\u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Chuck", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Chuck Wepner, the \"Bayonne Bleeder,\" the boxer who fought Muhammad Ali in 1975 and\u2014famously\u2014knocked Ali down in the 9th round (equally famously, he lost the fight when Ali knocked him down in the 15th), was also known as \"the real Rocky\" (apparently it was something he touted often), the guy who was the inspiration for Sylvester Stallone's scrappy underdog Rocky Balboa. Wepner said of the fight with Ali, \u201cI showed the world that I belonged in there. That\u2019s what I really wanted to do,\" a comment revealing Wepner's trademark confidence mixed with huge insecurity about his status. If there's one aspect that Liev Schreiber captures perfectly in his portrayal of Wepner in Philippe Falardeau's feature film \"Chuck,\" it is that energy, the energy of the loudest, most expansive braggart in any room, terrified that he is seen as some kind of a joke. Advertisement \"Chuck\" struggles initially to find its footing, with an over-reliance on voiceover (much of it inspired by the style of Ray Liotta's deadpan in \"GoodFellas\") and an extremely on-the-nose soundtrack (\"I Believe in Miracles\"\u2014already over-used in film soundtracks\u2014playing over a scene of Wepner traveling to an important fight, etc.) These choices dominate early on, and don't leave you any room to make up your own mind. But \"Chuck\" ultimately works, mainly because Schreiber is so watchable. There's something compelling about seeing a man who is so strong and so weak, simultaneously. You like him in spite of him.\u00a0 When the film opens, Wepner is a Bayonne celebrity, the BMOC, the guy who walks into a bar greeted by cheers. Phyliss, his wife (Elisabeth Moss, who has one of the most interesting and busy careers in show business right now), loves him, supports him, but also has her limits, as shown in a wonderful scene early on when she breaks up a \"date\" he's on with some blonde bimbo. Phyllis doesn't throw a fit. She's as tough as her husband. She just makes her points, devastatingly, as the two culprits squirm. Ron Perlman plays Wepner's manager, working out of a run-down gym, trying to drum up gigs. Naomi Watts plays Linda, a local bartender whom Wepner falls for instantly, not just because she's beautiful, but because she has seen \"Requiem for a Heavyweight,\" his #1 all-time favorite movie. (Fragments from that 1962 film are interspersed throughout.) He asks Linda out and she turns him down. \"Aren't you married?\" she asks. Into this small-town small-time world (the film really understands Bayonne and its rhythms) comes the random chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world, Muhammad Ali. Ali and George Foreman had just had their \"rumble in the jungle\" in Zaire in 1974, arguably the most famous boxing match of all time. Wepner, out of seemingly nowhere, is thrust into the upper echelons of the sport, facing reporters, staying in hotels, participating in good-natured press conferences with Ali (a wonderful Pooch Hall). Wepner flip-flops between elation and loneliness, chest-thumping and insecurity. This is not a complex man. He's all impulse, and he has no impulse control. What's fascinating about this story is that he loses the fight, but he loses in such a way that he becomes a celebrity. \"Rocky\" the franchise has gone in many different directions (Balboa basically helped end the Cold War at one point), but that first film ends with Balboa losing (a bold choice), but actually winning in the hearts of minds of the crowd, of Apollo, of his girlfriend. It's a killer hook, and it's not surprising that Stallone would be drawn to that aspect of it.\u00a0 Advertisement One of the most fascinating sequences in \"Chuck\" is when Sylvester Stallone steps into the story. Stallone is played by Morgan Spector, who nails Stallone's distinctive voice, as well as his disarming openness and enthusiasm. Wepner becomes so caught up in the \"Rocky\" thing that when he watches the film sweep the Oscars, it is as though he's part of the team that made it. In many ways, he is an unbearable man, fragile and selfish and immature. Schreiber plays him as a man who lacks the ability to reflect, who is unable to correct himself. He's all appetite. He cannot say no to a challenge, a line of coke, a girl behind the bar. \"Chuck\" is smart in that it does not plead too much for us to sympathize with the main character. The approach is unfussy enough that it that makes you feel like you are just following Wepner around, observing him. There are scenes (one, in particular) that are almost too embarrassing to watch. But there's a tenacity in Wepner, a dogged self-belief, that is weirdly charming. You can understand why Phyllis is fed up, but you can also understand why Linda is drawn to him.\u00a0 Actors have a tendency to get grandiose when they play boxers. It's a pitfall with that kind of role. Schreiber doesn't. He, a self-aware actor, plays a man completely lacking in self-awareness, and he does so in a way that is invisible. You don't \"see\" his work as an actor. Schreiber has great range; he can be menacing, sexy, thoughtful, funny. There's no sense of strain or reach in his characterization of Wepner. It's extremely truthful work. Boxing movies have been as much a part of the movie industry's storytelling arsenal as the Western. There's the visual fascination of the sport itself, the fighters' wordless commitment to physical movement, the ballet of it. There's also the thematic aspect that's a draw as a metaphor: a guy gutting through pain, standing up after being knocked down, the sheer endurance it takes to even get up the guts to walk into the ring. There's the cinematically rich sleaziness that surrounds the boxing world, bookies and gangsters, the temptations of easy money, drugs, floozies. We've seen it all before. \"Chuck\" does nothing new, and it moves through boxing tropes like it's ticking off checkmarks, but there's an honesty to it, a fresh and messy one.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "A Family Man", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"A Family Man\" is one of those films where a fast-talking forty-something upper-middle class husband and father who works too much and doesn't appreciate the simple things in life endures a catastrophic twist of fate and changes his tune. There are a few excellent films that tell that story, a number of watchable but forgettable ones, and so many bad ones that we'd better not start listing them here because we might not know where to stop. To greater or lesser degrees, even the better examples of this sort of movie can feel like veiled apologies by hard-driving Hollywood types (or the money folks who bankroll their work) for spending too much time on the set, in the studio boardroom, at the strip club, or whatever. They all ultimately rise or fall on the basis of their artistry. The less artistry there is, the more phony and self-serving the movie seems. Advertisement This one, directed by Mark Williams from a screenplay\u00a0by former corporate headhunter Bill Dubuque,\u00a0falls somewhere between the second and third categories. It's not great, not terrible, mostly bearable, occasionally insufferable; you might watch it all the way through if you were tucked into a blanket on a couch and weren't so thirsty, hungry or in need of a bathroom break that you felt compelled to get up. The photography is excellent; the direction is competent enough to pass muster on most cable TV dramas, and there are a number of sparkling performances in supporting roles. But the script wavers between convincing, mostly silent moments of interaction and cringe-inducing, spell-it-all-out dialogue.\u00a0And the lead role of\u00a0Dane Jensen\u00a0has unfortunately been miscast with Gerard Butler.\u00a0 Butler has only himself to blame for that last error. Seeking to prove his versatility after years of global superstardom in action blockbusters (\"300,\" \"Olympus Has Fallen\" and its sequels), Butler embraced this script, used his clout to get it made, and took an executive producer credit on the finished product.\u00a0A tale like that should warm the hearts of movie buffs who love it when an actor known for one kind of role blossoms in something different. The gold standard is Burt Lancaster, a brawny sex symbol in film noir, action films, war pictures and Westerns who successfully cast himself against type in dramas that he coproduced, including the classic \"Sweet Smell of Success,\" in which he donned horn-rimmed glasses and played many of his scenes while sitting at a table in a restaurant. Butler is no Lancaster. As Dane, he does the 1980s-'90s Michael Douglas thing, spitting out cynical, acidic monologues on telephones and in boardrooms, his swelled torso and arms straining against tight-fitting jackets and ties, then heading home to dote on his cute children, Ryan (Max Jenkins) and Laura (Julia Butters), and flirt or fight with his wife Elise (Gretchen Mol), who loves him but wishes he'd spend more time with the family he supposedly adores. Then a kind but blunt oncologist named Dr. Singh (Anupam Kher) informs the Jensens that Ryan has leukemia and might not live, and the movie shifts into a message-y melodrama that essentially combines the Ebenezer Scrooge and Bob Cratchit plots in \"A Christmas Carol\" and makes poor Tiny Tim the engine of change by filling the audience with fear that he'll end up as a ghost.\u00a0 Advertisement You've got to be astonishingly skilled, likable and convincing to put a role like this one over the top. And you absolutely\u00a0have\u00a0to put it over, because if the actor who's at the center of nearly every scene in a moralistic tearjerker isn't dazzling in every frame, the picture will just lie there radiating anxious boredom, like a dog that wants to go outside but can't get anyone's attention. Butler tries his best, but never strong enough to make you stop imagining what someone else could have done with the part. He's unconvincing in nearly every scene except ones where life punches him in the gut and he has to be quiet and think about what just happened to him. He's supposed to be mesmerizingly charismatic and sly in the \"Master of the Universe\" scenes where he's bamboozling people, schooling eager underlings, and trying to win a cutthroat contest (Dane's boss, played by Willem Dafoe, pits him against a coworker, played by Alison Brie, with the promise that he'll promote the winner of a sales contest to the position of general manager). But this material, which might've been appallingly exciting if played by Douglas or Denzel Washington or Robert Downey, Jr. or someone else with devilish charm, never sparks to life because Butler too often comes across as domineering and self-involved, like one of those motormouthed meatheads you'd try to avoid talking to at a party. He has two default expressions, a determined scowl and a furrowed-brow \"Oh, my gosh, what does this mean?\" Mol partly humanizes Butler in the domestic scenes\u2014almost heroically, considering what a nothing part she's been handed; this is the kind of suffering wife role where an actress has to say \"Even when you're here, you're not really here\"\u2014but there's only so much that she, Dafoe, and the rest of the cast can do.\u00a0 There are a few intelligent, sincere, even wrenching scenes in \"A Family Man,\" in particular the moment where Elise accuses her husband of wanting to prolong the life of a child who might not make it because he feels guilty about not having been around more. (That sort of accusation hits so close to the bone that it might make some parents in the audience shudder.) There are other, less dire scenes that also ring true, like the one where Dane pronounces himself \"a goddamn American hero\" for working late all the time and Elise laughs in his face and makes him laugh, too. Better still is the scene where Dr. Singh entertains theological questions from his young patient, who has suddenly and understandably become obsessed with God and the afterlife: the doctor tells Ryan that over the decades he's become convinced that \"all religions are some version of 'what goes around comes around.'\" Advertisement That's true, for the most part. And yet, like too many exchanges in \"A Family Man,\" it also privileges its hero's moral growth over every other story that it tells, and ultimately makes them all seems like extensions of Dane's struggle. Is God punishing Dane's arrogance by making his son sick? When he struggles to find a cure or a better treatment for his son, or simply to ease the boy's suffering, or when he goes the extra kilometer to help a 59-year old, hard-to-employ client (Alfred Molina, excellent as usual), is he doing penance? If he is doing penance, does that mean that if either or both stories\u2014or other stories related to Dane\u2014end happily, that God or the Fates or the universe are rewarding Dane for becoming a better person? If Dane's son dies, or if his client doesn't get that job, or if his wife divorces him, does that mean he deserves whatever misery befell him because he spent so much time at the office? These are not questions the film seems too interested in exploring, and maybe it's better off for not trying. That kind of introspective philosophizing tends to lead a film toward ambiguity and open-ended storytelling, toward contradiction and complexity, sometimes towards audience frustration. None of those things would seem to be in the filmmakers' wheelhouses, or even in their temperaments. Whenever the movie reaches for poetry it lands somewhere in a chain drugstore's greeting card aisle, trying to choose between one that shows an adorable child laughing in a Photoshopped field of sunlit daisies, one that tries for gallows humor but isn't really that funny, and a third with a quote about mortality and wisdom only seems thoughtful because it's written in cursive.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Barbara", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The woman sits in a park, legs crossed, smoking, relaxed. Two men watch her from a window above the park, and they discuss her, looking down on her. \"If she were six, you would say she was sulky,\" one of the men says. \"Since her incarceration, her group of friends has been destroyed.\" She is meeting the two men, and one says, \"She won't come in a moment before it's time.\" It is an eloquent exchange, and even more eloquently filmed, the woman seen in long shot, from above. She knows she is being watched. Her \"relaxation,\" then, is an act of public theatre.  Advertisement This is the opening scene in Christian Petzold's effective psychological and political thriller \"Barbara,\" and it sets up the tension and atmosphere with precision and a taut elegance. It is East Germany, 1980. Barbara, the woman, played by Petzold's regular muse, Nina Hoss, is a chilly alert blonde. Barbara is a doctor and has been placed in a rural medical clinic as punishment for applying for an exit visa. Given an apartment by the State, Barbara is under constant surveillance by the Stasi. Andre, the doctor who runs the clinic (played by the gentle, hunky Ronald Zehrfeld), is an informer for the Stasi, and yet he does not seem devoted or fanatical in that role. His primary priority is his patients. He would also like to get to The Hague someday, to see Rembrandt's \"Anatomy Lesson\" in person, although his hope for being allowed such a trip is dim. Andre recognizes Barbara's gift at her job during her first shift, when she correctly diagnoses a teenage girl (Jasna Fritzi Bauer) with meningitis, the signs of which the rest of the doctors had missed. Barbara, the cool character self-consciously smoking in the park, is an entirely different person at her job. The girl has escaped from Torgau, a Socialist work camp nearby, and Barbara treats her with a mischievous warm camaraderie, and reads to her at night. Barbara's choice of book is significant: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  In Mark Twain's classic, Huck and Jim, on the run, take to the Mississippi River in a raft, loosening the fetters that bind them on the mainland, all while plunging deeper and deeper into slave country. Barbara, who has secret rendezvous in a nearby forest with a lover from West Germany, smokes expensive black market cigarettes, and has mysterious meetings with people who surreptitiously hand her packets of money, is a flight risk: you can sense that in her tense posture, and in her wild-looking eyes flicking out the window at the sound of every car horn.  Advertisement Nina Hoss is a magnificent actress, watchful, tense, and spikily intelligent. When a smile cracks open on her face, the warmth and beauty is heartbreaking, because of the contrast. Hoss' work in all of Petzold's films is good, and while he has used her continuously, she never shows up as quite the same character. The woman in \"Yella\" is not the same as the one in \"Jerichow\" or in \"Barbara.\" Nina Hoss can do anything.  In East Germany, in 1980, no one is to be trusted, and Petzold creates that sense of oppression with meticulous sound design (never has a doorbell sounded so frightening), and yawning gaps in between conversations, gaps filled with sound: wind, echoing footsteps in a hallway, trees rustling, the crunch of gravel under bicycle wheels. There is no score. The only music comes from the radio, once, and when Barbara plays her newly-tuned piano alone in her apartment. Barbara's landlady stares at her with cold expressionless eyes, a piano tuner shows up unexpectedly, freaking Barbara out (he must be there to inform on her), and every interpersonal interaction is charged with suspicion. Even the romantic and sexual tension in between Barbara and Andre seems loaded and dangerous.  \"Barbara\" is extremely suspenseful, without using the common genre trappings. The workings of the clinic are observed in a detailed fashion. Andre has set up a lab where he makes his own serum, a fact that impresses Barbara, accustomed as she is to better big-city hospitals. Petzold's films with Hoss are often about different sub-cultures of work, as well as about the long shadow left by Germany's split: in \"Yella,\" Petzold examines the risky thrill-seeking world of corporate negotiations; in \"Jerichow\" it's the ins and outs of snack bar ownership, and in \"Barbara,\" the challenges of running an out-of-the-way clinic, short on supplies and staff. There are decisions to be made about the patients (the teenage girl with meningitis, and another teenager, a failed suicide), and these decisions require cooperation and openness, anathema in a police state.  Andre, after examining the boy who attempted suicide, confides to Barbara, \"I don't know. Something is wrong. I can feel it.\" One could say that about the entirety of the world portrayed in \"Barbara,\" a world filled with everyday objects: bathtubs, pianos, bicycles, cigarettes, all of which take on portentous significance when seen in the context of totalitarian culture. Something is wrong in East Germany, and everyone can feel it. Doctors examine a patient and make a guess at a diagnosis.  The reality of Barbara's world, and the world of all East Germans, is one of constant surveillance, omnipresent informers, and a huge gap between private and public behavior. Petzold is a master at creating the kind of tension that can be felt on a subterranean level, a sort of acute uneasiness that can't be easily diagnosed, fixed, or even acknowledged by the characters. This is well-trod ground for Petzold, but never has it been so fully realized, so palpable, as in \"Barbara.\" Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Everybody Wants Some!!", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "All kinds of possibilities open up when a director keeps things loose. Looseness can result in unformed, repetitive, or boring storytelling. Richard Linklater's looseness operates differently. Relationships are the most important thing to him, how people connect, or don't. Linklater is obsessed with the peripheral, the seemingly unimportant or random. People in real life rarely stop dead in their tracks to have a profound moment, and they don't in his films either. When Linklater's style works (and it works in \"Everybody Wants Some!!\"), there is nobody quite like him.\u00a0 Advertisement Linklater has described \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" as a \"spiritual sequel\" to his 1993 high-school comedy \"Dazed and Confused.\" \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" takes place in 1980, tracking the lives of a group of college baseball players in the three days before classes start. There are two \"baseball houses,\" rambling affairs on the outskirts of campus where the baseball team settles in to a routine of partying, philosophizing, and competition. Dancing, romance, conversation\u2014all become battles for dominance. The guys peacock for one another more than for the girls who show up at their parties. When the boys get dressed to go out to a club, their preening is reminiscent of John Travolta staring at himself in the mirror in \"Saturday\u00a0Night Fever.\" These guys are dudes, with the satisfied glow of successful athletes. They move with a collective strut, a swagger. They have spent their childhoods with one organizing purpose: baseball. And this sets them apart from their peers (whom they regard as slackers). None of them (except one who refers to himself as \"the second Nolan Ryan\") have dreams of going pro. College is an opportunity to get four more years doing what they love most before \"real life\" starts. All of this could be deadly if handled poorly. Who wants to see a bunch of jocks competing to win in every moment of every day? (Well, I do, but I assume that is not true for everyone.) Linklater keeps it loose, funny, relishing in the free-form of the group dynamic. A ping pong match turns on a dime and becomes deadly serious. Guys knuckle-flick each other until they draw blood. They try to slice a baseball in half with an axe as it comes across the plate. They compete to see who can inhale the biggest bong hit. Even jumping into a river becomes a display of who does it best. Linklater approaches all of this with affection, and even kindness\u2014one of his distinguishing characteristics. \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is a corrective to the tired, false \"dumb jock\" stereotype. Jake (Blake Jenner) is a freshman pitcher, entering one of the baseball houses on his first day of school, holding his milk crate full of albums (Devo's Are We Not Men visible), and confronted with the initial hostility of the mustachioed intimidating upper classmen. They aren't hostile because he's a freshman. They're hostile because he's a pitcher. (\"Everybody Wants Some!!\" is insightful and funny about inter-position conflicts in baseball. An older pitcher encourages Jake to accept his outsider status: \"Embrace your inner strange.\") Jake meets the ragtag bunch of guys in various states of chaos: smoking weed, filling up a waterbed, practicing a pitching wind-up buck-naked, etc. After a stern speech from the coach reminding them of the house rules (no alcohol, no girls upstairs in bedrooms), the group promptly breaks all of them, simultaneously, almost before the coach leaves the house. Advertisement Over the course of the three days, the guys attend four separate parties. The film presents a good cross-section of the culture in 1980: disco is still popular, country-western is coming back, and the slam-dancing sub-culture of punk is on the rise. (Humorously, one of the parties they attend is thrown by the theatre department at the college, proving that theatre kids are the same in any era.) In some environments, the jocks are cock of the walk. In others, they are out of their depth. But girl-hunting is girl-hunting whether she sports a Mohawk or a cowboy hat. Jake crushes on a sweet theatre major (Zoey Deutch). They have nothing in common except for the important fact that have both lived their short lives focused on a passion requiring seriousness and discipline. They are the opposite of \"slackers.\" Their romance is just one part of the overall texture of the film. Some of the cast members are recognizable actors, although there are no big stars in it. Some of the guys have no acting experience. It's a great mix. The group is a shifting mass of alliances, hostility-outbreaks, and a sense of togetherness-by-default deriving from the fact that they are a championship ball team. I was surprised at how strangely thrilling it was to finally get to see them play baseball at their first practice. All the guys do throughout the film is talk about baseball, even pre- and post-coitus, and when we see them in action it's deeply satisfying and emblematic of one of the ways in which Linklater works by stealth. Linklater's style isn't invisible, although he approaches moments with a casual lightness of touch. Some of his cuts are laugh-out-loud funny. (My favorite cut in a Linklater film cuts comes in \"Bernie,\" after Jack Black shoots Shirley MacLaine, and wails, \"What am I going to do?\") The film has an easy rhythm. Moments aren't lingered over. Hilarious details go unmentioned (the fact that they all go back to the house to change clothes, depending on the next party in the lineup.) Some of the commentary from the guys states the obvious too much, i.e.: \"Have you noticed that everything we do is a competition?\", but for the most part, Linklater's script avoids self-awareness that would pull you out of it. In 1980, there were still hostages in Iran. Jimmy Carter was President (but not for long). 1980 was closer to the '70s than the slick yuppie-MTV era coming down the pike, and Linklater's frequent production designer Bruce Curtis gets that distinction. (So do Gabriella Villarreal on set decoration and costume designer Kari Perkins.) There are gas guzzling cars, silk shirts with pointed collars, girls in halter tops. The soundtrack ranges from Blondie to Foreigner. The film captures an elusive in-between moment in time the second before it vanishes.\u00a0 Advertisement Nostalgia is at its worst when the story being told is suffused in a golden glow, that glow assuming (wrongly) that the nostalgia portrayed is universal. People are nostalgic for different things. What Laura Ingalls Wilder was nostalgic for was not what F. Scott Fitzgerald was nostalgic for, although both wrote mainly from nostalgia. There's nostalgia that becomes kitsch, the objects/fashion/music of the past coming around to be \"cool\" again. There's nostalgia that is interchangeable with longing and sadness. There's nostalgia that is anti-progress. Despite the \"everybody\" in the title, Linklater's nostalgia is specific to the sounds and smells and sights of the time in which he grew up, in which his personality was formed. Crucially, he doesn't laugh at these younger selves, although he often finds them extremely funny. \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" doesn't fall into the trap that a lot of period films do where the audience is encouraged to consider themselves superior to the folks \"back then.\" Linklater cuts us off at the pass when we may be inclined to snicker. He's not afraid of including sincerity. \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" features two girls mud-wrestling in their underwear and it also shows a quiet romantic moment near a river at dawn. Neither scene jars or upsets the balance. With all the rough-housing, it's an extremely gentle film.\u00a0 Linklater's best films are high-wire acts. Not to be tried by amateurs.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Whiplash", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Whiplash\" is cinematic adrenalin. In an era when\r\nso many films feel more refined by focus groups or marketing managers, it is a deeply personal and vibrantly alive drama. Damien Chazelle has taken a relatively staid subject like the\r\nrelationship between a music student and his teacher and turned it into a\r\nthriller built on a brilliant undercurrent of social commentary about what it\r\ntakes to make it in an increasingly competitive and cutthroat world. How far\r\nare you willing to push yourself to succeed? How far are you willing to push\r\nsomeone else to force them on the path to success? Carried by two electric\r\nperformances, the tightest editing in a film this year and a daring screenplay\r\nthat writes itself into a corner and then somehow finds an unexpected way out, \"Whiplash\" is as\r\nbreathless as a drum solo, rising and falling just as the\r\nhopes and dreams of its protagonist climb and crash.  Advertisement A young man named Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller) is practicing\r\nlate at night at his New York music school, one of the best in the country,\r\nwhen his drumming catches the ear of the infamous Mr. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons),\r\nthe most important teacher at the school and the conductor for its most\r\nimportant jazz band. Fletcher pauses, listens, barks a few orders at the young\r\nman, and moves on, seemingly dissatisfied with what he heard. Andrew had his\r\nchance, that one brief moment many of us have to impress the people who can\r\nchange our lives, and he didn't cut it. He goes back to his routine class band,\r\ntelling his dad (a wonderfully genuine Paul Reiser) that his opportunity to\r\nmove up probably passed him by. Of course, Fletcher's dismissal of Andrew in that first scene\r\nis just the first of many examples of what could politely be called his\r\n\"teaching style.\" Fletcher likes to tell the apocryphal story of how\r\nJo Jones threw a cymbal at Charlie Parker's head one night when he messed up,\r\nthereby pushing him to the breaking point at which he became Bird. Without that\r\ncymbal, would music history be the same? Would Charlie Parker have gone home,\r\nrefined, practiced and driven himself without the threat of not just failure\r\nbut physical violence? Fletcher uses that kind of barbarous technique\r\non his students: throwing furniture, calling Andrew names, playing mind games\r\nand physically torturing him with repetitive drum solos until he bleeds on the\r\nkit. But that blood feeds his musical passion. And Andrew blossoms, asking out\r\nthe cute girl he's been afraid to talk to before, and taking first chair in the\r\nmost important band at the most important music school in the country. Miles Teller, so great in breakthrough roles in \u201cRabbit Hole\u201d\r\nand \u201cThe Spectacular Now,\u201d does the best work of his young career here as Andrew, finding\r\nthe perfect blend of insecurity and confidence that comes entangled in the core\r\nof a young talent. Andrew is naturally apprehensive, but he also knows he has a\r\ndrive, a passion, a skill that is unique. Teller walks that line, never\r\nfaltering by making Andrew too confident while also carefully letting viewers\r\nsee the spark within that Fletcher fuels. Advertisement As for Simmons, Fletcher could have been such\r\na caricature in the wrong actor\u2019s hands. An over-the-top, abusive teacher is a part riddled with pitfalls. Simmons falls into none of them. He walks\r\nsuch a line that, even after the kind of inhumane mind games and physical abuse\r\nthat should produce legal charges has unfolded on screen, we find ourselves\r\ndrawn to Fletcher. He\u2019s not 100% wrong when he says that the most dangerous two\r\nwords in the English language are \u201cgood job.\u201d Whether you think it's the right approach or not, we\u2019re in an era of praise,\r\nwhere encouragement is the teaching tool and every kid gets a medal for participation. Have true talents been left to wither because they were over-watered?\r\nSimmons perfectly captures the drive of a man who believes his abusive degree\r\nof pressure is the only way to produce a diamond. While \u201cWhiplash\u201d would be a notable film purely for Teller\r\nand Simmons\u2019 performances, it reaches a different level when one considers the\r\nexecution of its tempo. Editor Tom Cross and cinematographer Sharone Meir often\r\nput us right on stage with Andrew and Fletcher, cutting and panning in rhythm with\r\nthe beat of the drum. It is captivating, to say the least, particularly in a\r\nclimax that produces more tension than any action film or thriller this year.\r\nThe title refers to a song played multiple times throughout Chazelle\u2019s film. It\r\ncould also refer to that sense of wowed exhaustion you\u2019ll feel when it\u2019s over.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Strange Little Cat", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Taking place almost entirely within the claustrophobic confines of a  middle-class Berlin apartment, Ramon Zurcher's debut film, \"The Strange  Little Cat,\" features a curious and alert tabby, busy scratching on  doors, batting its paws at a fluttering moth, staring out the window,  its tail flicking, or strolling about on the kitchen table. The cat is  not strange. But the film sure is, strange and creepy and entertaining.  It's like reading a short story by Chekhov or Ionesco, that was  translated by Kafka (the film is very very loosely based on  \"Metamorphosis\"), and then staged by Bertolt Brecht. Or Barnum &  Bailey. The cat isn't an observer. It is a participant in the circle of  family life, wrapped up in its own concerns, wanting what it wants,  strolling in and out of the frame as it pleases. Up above its head, or  off to the side, the droning mundane family conversations go on and on.  In \"The Strange Little Cat,\" the mundane may very well be the strangest  subject of all. Advertisement From the very first shot, we are clued in that there are depths of  strangeness to be plumbed in even the smallest and most banal  interactions. A little girl (Mia Kasalo) sits at a kitchen table,  writing something on a pad of paper, and occasionally opening her mouth  to scream at the top of her lungs, timing her screams to the roar of the  blender (off-camera). Grown-ups pass around her, their heads above the  frame, their conversations droning and banal, not acknowledging her.  What we are seeing is a regular family morning, but the framing from  cinematographer Alexander Hasskerl creates an enormous amount of  tension. That tension lasts throughout the film, a strength of its  relatively short running time. There is a Mother (Jenny Schily), who busies herself with food  preparation, her back to the camera. The framing, again, creates tension  in what is a normal everyday moment, a mother cutting fruit on the  counter. But the fact that her back is turned, so often, begins to seem  ominous. When she turns to look at her family gathering in the kitchen,  there is an intense remote quality to her face which can be quite  frightening, but you're never sure if you're projecting or not. Is she  about to fly the coop? There's a disturbing moment where she looks down  at the cat, eating at its food bowl, and she hovers her foot just above  the cat's head, as though she is contemplating crushing it. As the family gathers\u2014sons, daughters, their significant others, a sick  grandmother, a couple of uncles\u2014they chat with one another, crowding  through the kitchen. Someone will start speaking, sharing an event that  took place over the last couple of days. The mother shares a story about  going to the movies, and how the man next to her in the theatre placed  his foot on top of her foot and she wasn't sure how to move her foot  away. One of the older daughters shares a story about how she was  walking in the park, throwing down slices of orange rind, and how  strange it was that the orange part of the rind always landed face-down.  These stories are related in a flat-affect tone, which makes the  proceedings feel like an avant-garde theatre piece, with individual  actors stepping downstage and addressing the audience directly. In some  cases, the events described are shown in dreamy flashback. Advertisement All of this is quite haunting and hypnotic. The stories shared seem to  have, at their crux, the feeling that the world is a completely  mysterious place, where people and objects often behave in baffling  ways. The monologues continue, and people stroll in and out of the kitchen,  down the dark hallway, and back, and the apartment begins to take on a  life of its own. Objects start to rebel against the functions they were  meant for. Buttons fall off of people's shirts. Drinks spill. The  radiator has a weird echo. The washing machine is broken. A glass bottle  spins on the stove. A ball flies in through the kitchen window, thrown  from the courtyard below, an alarming moment when the belljar of the  family dynamic is shattered by an interloper. At the family dinner later  in the film, one of the fat sausages on the table squirts grease wildly  when someone cuts into it, causing hilarity. The refusal of objects to  behave appropriately and do what they were meant to do is reminiscent of  Jacques Tati's use of that trope repeatedly, to great comedic effect,  in \"Playtime,\" where a neon sign in a drugstore suddenly becomes a halo,  due to the placement of the priest below it, or fat leather chairs make  embarrassing fart-sighs when people sit down on them. There is a young son in the family, a little deadpan boy, who stands and  stares at the cat scratching at a door, or at the family dog who is  busy keeping his eye on the family cat, and the little boy says,  vaguely, to a nearby grownup, \"Is the cat/dog supposed to be doing  that?\" He never gets an answer. He seems to be the only one in the  family who is aware that the objects around them are in out-and-out  rebellion. Perhaps as a way to acknowledge that unspoken reality, he  flies a little automated helicopter into the crowded kitchen, where it  floats around through the grown-ups before crashing into a nearby fruit  bowl. Nobody notices. There is tension here between different family members. The little girl  is slapped across the face at one point by the Mother. Mother criticizes  the sounds her older daughter makes when she drinks her juice. But the  tension really comes from the get-go, from the static strange framing,  and the palpable sense that Zurcher and his cinematographer give that  something is not quite right here.\u00a0 The source of the tension remains  buried, which gives \"The Strange Little Cat\" a Harold Pinter-type  energy. Pinter wrote pauses into his scripts, pauses that actors  are encouraged to follow as though they are rests in a musical score.  The pauses add to the ominous sense that something is coming; something  gigantic is happening beneath the placid surface. It doesn't matter that  the characters are talking about washing machines and orange peels.  Something is going ON. The revelation may be that \"all\" that is going on  is the normal stresses of everyday family life, filmed in a way that  highlights the airless intimacy and the devotion-to-the-banal nature of  all of it; the ways we talk around each other, above each other; the way  we repeatedly \"miss\" each other, especially when we are in such close  quarters. Advertisement The only music in the film (\"Pulchritude\" by Thee More Shallows) is used  sparingly and specifically, and it usually marks the entrance of the  cat into the action, after a room has cleared. The music seems to act as  a cue: the humans have left the room, the cat can breathe more freely  now. People do behave in strange ways. Objects do rebel. We do live alongside  animals who have intentions and concerns of their own. Who can figure  it all out? \"The Strange Little Cat\" doesn't provide answers, and  doesn't reveal its underlying structure or mythology. The mystery is  almost total. That's the fun of it.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Gerald's Game", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Mike Flanagan reportedly carried around a copy of \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d to meetings because it was the Stephen King book he dreamed of adapting since he was a teenager. This is arguably a sign of insanity. Not only is it considered one of King\u2019s lesser works, but it takes place almost entirely in inner monologue and memory, with its only major character handcuffed to a bed. In other words, it always felt deeply impossible to adapt into a film, and that\u2019s not even getting into the downright silly ending. And yet Flanagan used the deserved credibility garnered from the success of \u201cOculus,\u201d \u201cHush\u201d and \u201cOuija: Origin of Evil\u201d to finally make his teenage dreams come true. The result is further proof that this filmmaker is for real. He has made just about the best version of \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d that could result from not majorly overhauling the book, and delivered a film, premiering today on Netflix, that stands as the best King adaptation of the year so far (which includes the disappointing \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d and shockingly huge \u201cIt,\u201d although the upcoming \u201c1922\u201d could dethrone it in a few weeks.) Advertisement A man smiles lovingly as he handcuffs his wife to a bed at a remote vacation home. The man is a successful attorney named Gerald (Bruce\u00a0Greenwood), and his wife is named Jessie (Carla Gugino). We can tell immediately that not everything is going smoothly in this union, but it\u2019s the kind of marital speedbump that can hopefully be overcome with some Sam Cooke and some Viagra. Oh, and maybe a little role-playing. With an early overhead shot, Flanagan has revealed that Gerald packed handcuffs, and he\u2019s eager to use them. When he starts becoming excited over the fact that no one could hear a handcuffed Jessie and covers her mouth with his hand, she tries to call it off. She doesn\u2019t feel sexy; she feels objectified. \u201cUncuff me and we can talk,\u201d she says. He replies, \u201cWhat if I won\u2019t?\u201d That loosely-veiled threat doesn\u2019t pay out, however, because Gerald has a heart attack, dropping dead right on top of her. She pushes his body off, and realizes the sheer horror of her predicament, handcuffed to a bed, too far away for anyone to hear her screams. What might seem goofy or even silly is played for terror instantly as Gugino conveys the multiple horrors of a rape fantasy gone wrong, dead husband, and a trapped woman\u2014all within minutes. Flanagan trusts Gugino completely, keeping us locked with Jessie as long as conceivably possible. He also gets around the inner monologue problem of the book by allowing a lot of that exposition to come as an increasingly-hallucinating Jessie having \u201cconversations\u201d with a now-mobile Gerald and even a tougher version of herself. The scenes between Gugino and Greenwood are phenomenally written as the actress plays the realism of her predicament and Greenwood recognizes that he\u2019s playing an exaggerated version of Gerald, the one his wife would envision. The idea that Jessie would have visions of a devil and angel on her shoulder to get her out of her situation is interesting enough but even more so when you consider that the angel is a tougher version of herself and the devil is her now-dead husband. Flanagan has become more and more confident as a craftsman with each film. Here he knows that less is more, never resorting to the techniques that a lot of filmmakers would have used to make up for the lack of story. Instead of loud jump scares or quick cuts, he pulls out score for most of the film and goes with long takes, putting us in the room with Jessie and her husband\u2019s body. We only leave that space when absolutely necessary, for an essential flashback that adds deeper subtext to this story, revealing that Jessie has a dark past she once buried but that could now be the key to saving her life. It\u2019s an incredibly well-made film, and Flanagan gets the best performances he\u2019s directed yet from Gugino and Greenwood\u2014it\u2019s great to see them get such juicy roles. Advertisement Any diehard King fan will tell you that the author\u2019s biggest problem is endings. For years, it was almost a joke that King didn\u2019t know how to wrap up even his best books. His ending for \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d is atrocious, and you\u2019d be better off turning this off about ten minutes before the credits and just imagining what happens. I\u2019ll say this\u2014he does about as good a job with King\u2019s ending as I think he possibly could have, even finding a neat visual trick in the closing scenes that helps tie Jessie\u2019s story together thematically. Still, it\u2019s remarkable that Flanagan didn\u2019t decide to completely alter the twisty ending, but it shows how loyal he was to bringing the challenges of this novel to the big screen intact.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Promise", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The Belfast-born writer and director Terry George is most at home in settings where there are troubles, and sorry about the unintentional play on words. With director Jim Sheridan he crafted two of the most searing and memorable films about his homeland and its tortured history, 1993\u2019s \u201cIn the Name of the Father\u201d and 1997\u2019s \u201cThe Boxer,\u201d both starring Daniel Day-Lewis. When he\u2019s been behind the camera himself, he hasn\u2019t chosen rom-coms: his 1998 HBO movie \u201cA Bright Shining Lie\u201d treated the Vietnam debacle from a particular military perspective, and 2004\u2019s \u201cHotel Rwanda\u201d took a focused look at one man\u2019s action against the Rwandan genocide. Even George\u2019s little-seen 2007 domestic tragedy \u201cReservation Road\u201d had a larger point about societal ills animating its core.  Advertisement With \u201cThe Promise,\u201d George, co-writing with Robin Swicord, treats the Armenian genocide of the early part of the 20th century, an action undertaken by the soon-to-be-displaced Ottoman Empire, as a side exercise in its alliance with Germany as World War I was about to break out. Well over a million souls were killed in this action, which the contemporary Turkish government still declines to acknowledge. Indeed, the recent movie \u201cThe Ottoman Lieutenant,\u201d set in the same period as this one, is produced in part by Turkish interests and has several scenes in which there\u2019s a pronounced \u201cwhatever Armenians WERE killed kind of had it coming\u201d vibe. And this film has been preemptively down-voted on IMDb by Armenian genocide deniers. One nice thing about George is that when he takes on a subject, he doesn\u2019t flinch or back down about the truths he needs to convey. But it\u2019s hard to deny that in some respects, \u201cThe Promise\u201d takes a long way to getting around to the meat of the story.  George and Swicord have chosen to focus the story around a love triangle. Young Mikael Boghosian, an apothecary from a village in Southern Turkey, betroths himself to a young woman from a family of means in order to go to Constantinople to attend medical school. At the house of the well-off relative with whom he\u2019s lodging, he meets the beautiful Anna, an artist who\u2019s also Armenian. Anna is married to Chris Myers, a committed American journalist who\u2019s also a hard-headed hard drinker. You see where this is going.  As Mikael, Oscar Isaac doesn\u2019t settle into his role right away, perhaps because for a while there isn\u2019t much of a role to settle into. He is the embodiment of goodness, of earnestness. Making a friend at the institute where he\u2019s enrolled, the fellow student asks \u201cSo you\u2019ve already studied medicine?\u201d and Mikael answers, \u201cYes, it\u2019s my passion,\u201d and all the ingenuousness Isaac can bring to bear on the character doesn\u2019t rescue the line. Once he admits his passion to Anna, he also reminds himself and her that he is indeed promised to another. Anna, in an excellent portrayal by Charlotte Le Bon, is the one who winds up pushing the issue. If Christian Bale\u2019s performance as Chris has the most vigor and intelligence, it\u2019s at least in part because the troubled character himself has those traits in the most abundance. Alliances are formed, trusts are broken, and then history intrudes; these three characters lose and find each other time and again as war destroys everything around them in each of the environments they travel to.  Advertisement For Mikael, that\u2019s initially a prison camp, where after a depiction of the depredations of hard labor, a dramatic incident involving \u201cweeping\u201d dynamite affords him his escape. He then returns to his village, where he does marry Maral, the young woman he\u2019d left behind; the couples\u2019 families hide them in a mountain cabin, and Mikael grows to love his bide. The theme of the good man who becomes a devoted husband while secretly loving another from afar is reminiscent of \u201cDoctor Zhivago.\u201d But while Anna and Myers take up resistance to the Armenian \u201cevacuations\u201d at a Protestant Mission, the Turkish exterminators are rampaging. The movie hits its cinematic stride, as it happens, when events are at their worst. \"The Promise\" is drenched in production value and replete with ravishing shots of sunrises and sunsets, but it\u2019s in the scenes of fleeing, of battle, and of horrendous loss that the film is at its most effective. The depiction of the savagery inflicted on Armenia is bracing. George is determined to make his story as much about the dead as about the fictional survivors. It\u2019s in that respect that \u201cThe Promise\u201d earns its unsettling honor.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Time Out of Mind", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Oren Moverman's \"Time out of Mind,\" about a homeless and probably mentally ill man trying to survive in New York City, does not feel like a typical American independent drama made in this century. It's set in harsh reality and shot with a simplicity and directness that demands the viewer's full attention. And it is built around a lead performance by Richard Gere that immediately draws the viewer in through familiarity (or star power) but then increasingly demands that we engage with the character on his own terms, and forget whatever we think we know about the actor.\u00a0 Advertisement The movie starts with Gere's character, George, being surprised while squatting in an apartment. The building manager (Steve Buscemi, one of many name actors who play one or two scenes in the film) reluctantly tells him that he can't stay there anymore. George says he's waiting on \"her.\" In time we understand that he's talking about his daughter Maggie (Jena Malone), who kicked George out, again for unspecified reasons, though probably for drinking (in one brief sequence where George comes into a bit of cash, he spends it on a six pack and drinks it all at once). Eventually he ends up at a bleak, racially tense homeless shelter where he's befriended by Dixon (Ben Vereen), a former jazz man who has a dozen synonyms for every noun and speaks in the relentlessly upbeat cadences of a scam artist even when he's being entirely sincere. He has more experiences, and while we feel sure that the movie is edging toward a destination, we can tell by the tone and style that it's not going to be a typically upbeat one, with lessons learned and problems solved. \"Time out of Mind\" is an observational film, mainly concerned with behavior rather than story. You hear the characters' names in passing, and if you're not paying attention you might not hear them again. This is not the kind of movie where a character walks into a room and says how glad they are to see their friend George whom they haven't spoken to since that chance encounter in Queens almost seven years ago. Very rarely do the characters come right out and tell you exactly who they are or what happened to them or what they would like to happen to them.  Instead, Moverman puts us in the position of an eavesdropper or secret spectator throughout. The only music is provided by the PA systems of restaurants, bars and coffee shops, the speaker systems of passing cars, and occasional snatches of street music, such as the saxophone player who is heard (but not seen) in a brief scene set on a subway car. Watching \"Time Out of Mind\" is not like the ordinary experience of watching a movie; it's more like being in a public place and deciding to allow the scene around you to become a drama.  Advertisement We sometimes have to locate George in a shot, like Waldo in the popular children's books. Sometimes Moverman will pack the character into a door frame in the deep background of a shot, or look down on him from a third-story window as he crosses a street. When we do get closeups of George they often have the feel of having been \"stolen\"\u2014a word that independent filmmakers use to describe shots that are obtained without a permit from any authority, often from far away, with a telephoto lens, so that the actor is simply part of the landscape, and the real people around him are unwitting extras. Moverman did in fact shoot parts of \"Time Out of Mind\" this way, and it has the effect of situating us within George's headspace (he's just one New Yorker among many) and also creating a visual correlative for the idea behind the film: that people like George are, for all intents, invisible, a notion that becomes achingly clear as we see people pass him, or look past him, while going about their lives.  Gere's performance is almost entirely reactive, and this makes you appreciate his charisma all the more. There aren't many actors who can sustain a whole film just by sitting silently and thinking and occasionally saying something simple like \"Yes\" or \"I can't remember.\" Gere is one of them. I suppose there are viewers who will be unable to accept him in this role because he's still Richard Gere, Handsome Movie Star, and dismiss this as a \"vanity project,\" but that will be entirely their decision. This is as affecting a portrait of loneliness by a grey-haired onetime hunk as Clint Eastwood's work in \"Gran Torino\"\u2014a film that, unlike \"Time Out of Mind,\" never rose to the level of its lead performance.  Some of the most unusual and startling moments in the movie come about because Moverman and cinematographer Bobby Bukowski capture a moment by choosing a shot and staying with it. A lot of times they park the camera on Gere's face in closeup (sometimes head-on, sometimes in profile) as he tries not to let on that he's affected by a loud drama occurring adjacent to his silent one: a man having a meltdown while security guards try to escort him away from the scene of a fracas; a bunkmate at the shelter talking about the Bible and his job. In one of the film's many, extraordinary one-take scenes, we watch through a window covered by a metal screen while George eats a meal at a long table in the shelter's mess hall. Suddenly the man next to him reacts with alarm, then stands up and takes his plate and walks away as a mouse scampers across the table. George keeps eating.\u00a0  Advertisement There's a moment where George goes to spy on Maggie at her bartender job. He stands out on the street for a bit, watching her through a window, then approaches a young man who's standing on the sidewalk smoking a cigarette and talking on his cell phone to a young woman he hopes will have sex with him. Moverman gives us about a minute of this other man's story (revealed via the one-way conversation) while George waits for the right moment to approach and ask if the man could please go inside and deliver some photos to Maggie. It's the sort of scene that happens all the time in cities (though more often the request is, \"Can you spare a quarter?\") without anyone thinking about the sorrow that underlies it, and the inequity it reveals. The movie is probably too long; there are scenes that repeat points that were made a few scenes earlier, and moments where the dialogue verges on too-expository, as well as times when the framing seems less considered than fussed-over (a shot of a homeless shelter counselor as seen through the open window of a transom is just too much). But such moments are notable because of their scarcity. With certain rare exceptions\u2014the early films of Ramin Bahrini; Lodge Kerrigan's \"Keane\" from ten years ago; the current \"Tangerine\"\u2014American movies almost never tell stories about people this far down on the socioeconomic ladder, in a literally down-to-earth style that treats the world as a stage and roots each gesture in observed reality.  Moverman, the director of the Iraq war drama \"The Messenger\" and the cop corruption thriller \"Rampart,\" is three for three now. This is the best movie he's made, and the least beholden to commercial filmmaking norms. There are times when it gets close to turning into an American version of the sorts of stark yet tender dramas made by the Dardenne brothers in Belgium. What's the commercial value of a film like this? Probably nada, unless Gere and Vereen pick up a few critics' awards. But a big part of the film's power comes from the feeling that the filmmakers don't care about any of that. \"Time out of Mind\" seems to have been undertaken for no other reason than that the filmmakers and actors believed in the truth of the material. How many American movies can you say that about? Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Layover", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"The Layover\" is a slapstick comedy about two women who have the hots for the same guy. Alternately sentimental and raunchy, it wants to be another \"Bridesmaids,\" but settles for being one of those not-entirely-terrible movies that you leave on the TV because you're too tired to get up and find the remote so that you can change the channel.  Alexandra D'Addario plays Kate, a nicey-nice schoolteacher whose job is in jeopardy (probably because she's not very good at it). Kate Upton plays Meg, her best friend, aka The Wilder One; the first time we meet her, she's trying to sell imported North Korean cosmetics, and as the film goes on, she consistently acts as the troublemaker, though Kate catches up soon enough.  Advertisement The women decide to escape their troubles by taking a holiday vacation to the tropics, but when their plane is diverted to St. Louis, Missouri following a hurricane advisory, they become enamored with a dude who sat between them on the flight. His name is Ryan (Matt Barr). He's got long blond hair and a neatly trimmed beard, killer abs and a superhero chest, and his voice sounds a little bit like George Clooney's. Virtually the instant Ryan enters Kate and Meg's orbit, his very presence drives them into a spiral of brain-dead, sometimes vicious one-upsmanship.  Their nonstop competition for a beefcake prize continues until a third-act plot twist sends the story in a different direction. Of course by the end the friends must realize that their bond is more important than any man. In the meantime, we get treated to an array of slapstick setpieces, including an impromptu diving competition at a hotel pool that features the movie's only genuinely terrific visual punchline, and a scene involving The Filthiest Toilet in Missouri that ends up being merely disgusting. Molly Shannon, Rob Corddry, and Kal Penn are wasted in small roles. Penn's is borderline insulting: after anchoring three \"Harold and Kumar\" films, he's stuck playing a hotel manager who's confined to a couple of scenes. The script doesn't even have the courtesy to give him something interesting to do. I could have played his role, and I'm a terrible actor. The lead actresses are game for anything and knockout-gorgeous, in ways that stretch credulity sometimes\u2014the diving scene puts D'Addario in a bathing suit that could've been on the cover of Sports Illustrated, confirming that she's one of those schoolteachers who eats nothing but fish and rice and spends two hours a day at the gym. Barr is eye candy as well, though his part is underwritten at first and contrived near the end of the story. There are too many moments when you might catch yourself imagining the same material with ace comic performers in the roles (Kristen Wiig and Anna Faris, for instance). Upton in particular seems a case of settling for the actor you can get instead of casting the actor you need. She isn't explosively incorrect enough to provide the incandescent spark this character requires. Meg and Kate's relationship is a \"reasonable one/dangerous one\" pairing. The dangerous one needs to seem truly dangerous here, a creature of pure narcissism and hunger, though with a core of sweetness that explains why Kate puts up with her. Upton's Meg merely comes across as tediously self-absorbed and oblivious\u2014the kind of woman you'd immediately diagnose as a pill if you met her at a party, then avoid for the rest of the night.  Advertisement Matt Jones (\"NCIS,\" \"Found\"), who plays a hotel guest who gets pulled into Meg, Kate and Ryan's melodrama, is the only actor who seems to have a life apart from the lame situations he's required to enact. He's the heart and conscience of the film. That and a buck fifty will get you a cup of coffee. In fairness, David Hornsby and Lance Krall's screenplay and William H. Macy's direction (yes, really\u2014that William H. Macy) don't do the actors any favors. The lead characters don't have enough psychological meat to convince us that they'd toss a lifelong friendship in the garbage just because a great-looking guy came into the picture. Except for maybe a half-dozen shots, Macy treats the camera as a recording device, even though the writing and acting are rarely notable enough to be worth preserving. There are intriguing throwaway lines here and there\u2014\"Not this time,\" Kate says to Meg in a hotel hallway, suggesting that her friend has stolen guys from her in the past\u2014but these aren't developed in a way that might amplify the slapstick and give the mandatory reconciliation-with-lessons-learned moment feel improbably moving, as it should be in a film of this type. (The third act makes hash of the competition anyway, which is irritating.)  Maybe the heart of the problem is that Kate and Meg's behavior doesn't track with the practical realities of lifelong, functioning friendship between (most) women as experienced by...well, any functioning adult who lives in the world. This story would be more convincing with the genders flipped: two male nerds impulsively damage a lifelong bond after a pretty woman sits between them on a plane and, for one shining moment, makes them feel desirable, too.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Make Your Move", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Donny (Derek Hough) is an ex-con hoofer trying to make a living tap dancing for tourists on the streets of New Orleans. After his parole officer gives him a hard time, basically telling him to get a real job, Donny flees to New York to hook up with his foster brother Nick (Wesley \r\nJonathan), who is the proprietor of a hot underground dance club in Brooklyn called Static. Donny thinks maybe he could get a job dancing there, make some real money. He walks into a complicated turf war, between Nick and his former partner Kaz (Will Yun Lee). Kaz stole some \r\nideas, and then branched out on his own, opening his own rival dance club. Things have gotten ugly. Donny doesn't care about any of that, he just wants to dance! Advertisement Written and directed by Duane Adler, who wrote the screenplay for the original \"Step Up,\" \"Make Your Move\" has a pretty complicated plot, involving corporate sponsorship, event planning, career moves for dancers, visa and immigration issues, not to mention various family dramas and burgeoning romance. It's a lot to absorb. But a movie like \"Make Your Move\" rests on the success of its various dance sequences, not its plot. And the dancing here is exciting, innovative, and specific. Each \"number\" has a story behind it, a motivation, a different look and feel. Adler and his cinematographer Gregory Middleton chose to film much of the sequences using full-body shots, the camera moving with the dancers, giving us a chance to see the dancers in action, moving through space. Oftentimes, with dance movies, the camerawork and editing choices cut away from the full body, showing us different parts and gestures, trying to generate a sense of excitement and movement through the editing. It can be frustrating, especially if you grew up watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers: \"Let me see the whole dancer!\" \"Make Your Move\" shows us the whole dancer. These sequences really move in a way that feels organic. \r\nDonny almost instantly gets a crush on Aya (played by South Korean pop singer BoA), younger sister to Kaz. Aya dances with an all-girl group called the Cobu Girls, and their choreography is a combination of Japanese Taiko drumming and Broadway tap dancing. Aya is caught in the middle of the war between her older brother and Nick, and her problems are exacerbated by the fact that she will be sent back to Japan in three weeks if she doesn't get some kind of gig, and soon. She and Donny meet one night at Static, and end up doing \r\nan impromptu tap-dance battle along the top of the bar. That dance is when the film really kicks off. Both dancers are not only superb athletes, but committed to the moment underlying the dance. It's a flirt, it's a mating dance, it's a competition, both of them pushing each other on to better moves. You get a true sense of the enjoyment they get from dancing with one another. It's infectious. Despite the increasing violence between the two clubs, Aya and Donny strike up a sweet and tentative romance. Nick and Kaz try to intervene, and it's all quite Montague/Capulet at times. Aya's future is so uncertain, she's not sure she wants to get involved, and Donny takes that \"No\" for an answer, but asks if they could please dance together \r\nagain at least? The film understands what dance means to those who live and breathe it. There's a real feeling of pleasure and excitement when you find your \"partner,\" someone who pushes you to be better, who can read your moves ahead of time, who can move with you. I could have lived\r\n without the choreographed (literally) foreplay scene, as they dance their way to the bed, but there are other dance sequences between the two where their chemistry vibrates off the screen. Advertisement Derek Hough will be familiar to fans of \"Dancing with the Stars,\" and when he is allowed to let loose here and really show what he can do, he is an absolutely thrilling performer. And BoA, whose fame is enormous in Japan, is wonderful, bringing ambition, humor, and smarts to her character. You like them both. \"Make Your Move\" has an underlying sweetness that serves it well. It understands the need for community, for expression, for family. It's kind to its characters. It features a diverse cast, accurately reflecting the dance world and its inhabitants. Adler and Middleton know that when we come to a dance movie, we want a chance to see, really see, those dances. They find a way to do just that.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Goodbye to Language", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Yes, but what is Godard trying to say? This is the question, the question, the question critics ask, and have asked, since Jean Luc-Godard made his first feature, \"Breathless,\" back in 1959. And with his latest, \"Goodbye to Language,\" they're asking it again.\u00a0 What is it? Where to begin? Much of the film is built around a young couple at a lake house who do a lot of arguing and also spend a lot of time naked. (Much of this feels like a self-parody of European art cinema tendencies: How can I get people to sit still for an extended discussion of politics and language? By having attractive people take their clothes off, of course.)\u00a0But these characters one just anchor points for, essentially, a feature length montage, much of it quickly edited, with few shots held longer than three or four seconds. The style might be irritating in a traditional narrative film. But it seems of a piece in a movie that is partly about (Godard's films are always \"about\" more than one thing\u2014and often only partly about any of them) the impossibility of focusing, concentrating,\u00a0and\u00a0comprehending history, and politics, and the written and spoken word, then making all of it make some kind of sense, if only to yourself. If Terrence Malick tried to make a Godard film in the spirit of Godard, it might look something like this, though with less prolonged discussion of Hitler, the Holocaust, colonialism, imperialism and other favorite Godard subjects, but with Godard's cryptic voice-over aphorisms (\"This morning is a dream. Each person must think that the other is the dreamer\").\u00a0 Advertisement Did I mention it's in 3-D? It's in 3-D. And Godard's use of 3-D is the most original since Werner Herzog's \"The Cave of Forgotten Dreams.\" Herzog's brilliance was counterintuitive (at least from a commercial standpoint). He put a technical process that's often deployed in service of spectacle and violence and instead used it in the most mundane (and therefore revelatory) manner: to give an added sense of presence, of \"you are there-ness,\" to very long takes, of a camera gliding through plant life (a snake's-eye view) or an unseen viewer (us) scrutinizing an ancient mural, or listening to an expert tell us about that mural while shifting nervously from foot to foot.\u00a0 Godard deploys the technology in a cheeky way (of course he does; he's Godard!).\u00a0Here, 3-D becomes one more element in Godard's career-long fascination\u00a0with\u00a0exploring cinema's formal properties, its grammar and technique and technology\u2014the better to show how films can\u00a0tell or elide a story, reveal or obfuscate the truth, or just kill screen time by distracting us with pretty pictures or jokes.\u00a0There are a lot of pretty pictures in this movie, and a lot of jokes, and they're not all corrosive or politically minded. Sometimes Godard seems to just be doing them because he wants to do them\u2014because he wants to try something new, or different. Other times the film combines pretty pictures and jokes to create an oxymoron: a gorgeous sight gag.\u00a0 The film often superimposes two titles or subtitles over each other, collage-style, or allows people or objects in the frame to partly obscure written words; at a New York screening of \"Goodbye to Language\" a few weeks back, the first time the film played around with text in this way, you could see a few critics sort of leaning to one side, as if attempting to\u00a0see around whatever was on top of\u00a0the\u00a0thing that they wanted to see. The movie also uses 3-D to create\u00a0something\u00a0like 2 1/2 D, by which I mean, you're aware of separate planes within the same image, seemingly separated by\u00a0indeterminate\u00a0space, yet each plane is two-dimensional, which means the net effect is like looking\u00a0through\u00a0a series of scrims, each\u00a0emblazoned\u00a0with a silkscreened image. (Godard has contributed episodes to two 3-D anthology films, \"The Three Disasters\"\u00a0and \"The Bridges of Sarajevo.\" Clearly this format is not just a lark to him.) Advertisement Shooting in digital video again, the 83-year old director plays with color saturation, exposure, light and shadow.\u00a0In shots taken through the windshield of a car zipping down a highway at night, the blacks have been crushed so that you can't see any background detail; red taillights in the\u00a0background\u00a0become\u00a0splashes of red. In a shot of roses in a green field, the red of the flowers has\u00a0been\u00a0cranked up so that the color smears and seems to be trying to escape the petals, like spirits escaping a body. An intriguingly Malick-ian point-of-view shot looking up at trees festooned\u00a0with\u00a0fall leaves favors two colors: orange for the leaves and violet for the sky. And of course there are lots and lots and lots of shots of dogs. Godard loves dogs. Meanwhile the film's multiple\u00a0narrators\u00a0go full-steam ahead, peppering the soundtrack with thoughts and fragments of thoughts, some of them overlapping. Some music cues are cut off abruptly, as if somebody had pressed the \"Stop\" button on a recording. We hear that cinema is the enemy and\u00a0savior of memory, that the state is at war with its people. The camera lingers over a shot of a sink superimposed over a shot of bisected oranges and lemons superimposed over a red substance (blood) slowly spreading through water.\u00a0 The film continually circles back to its rhetorical center\u2014the idea that existence is about trying to reconcile the \"real\" world with the subjective experience of the world, and the names and notions we use to catalog and define the world\u2014but the digressions are what make it sing, or scat-sing. \"I will barely say a word,\" says a voice on the soundtrack\u2014maybe Godard?\u2014adding, \"I am looking for poverty in language.\" Given that the film is itself so richly expressive in every sort of language (written, spoken, visual) this seems like yet another wonderful joke, one that somehow doubles as a lament.\u00a0\"Goodbye to Language\" will be catnip to anyone who continues to appreciate Godard and find him fascinating, and toxic to anyone who read this review and thought, \"No thanks.\" It's a rapturous experience, mostly, though tempered by a certain Godardian crankiness.\u00a0Watching it is, I would imagine, as close as we'll get to being able to be Godard, sitting there thinking, or dreaming. It's a documentary of a restless mind.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Last of Robin Hood", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "A title as good as \"The Last of Robin Hood\" deserves a better movie. In fact, it deserves a good movie.\u00a0 That's a shame. If you were fantasy-casting this story of the sad final days of Errol Flynn\u2014who became an international star in 1938's \"The Adventures or Robin Hood\" and died in 1959, reputedly in the arms of a much younger woman\u2014you might not come up with a better group of actors than the one assembled by the film's writing and directing team,\u00a0Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland.\u00a0 As the aging but still insatiable Flynn, we have Kevin Kline, who often had a slightly swashbuckling air about him\u2014and a mischievous, a times mad gleam in his eye; they've dyed his hair and youthed him up just a bit with makeup, but he's physically a ringer for Flynn during the period covered in this film, the mid-to-late 1950s. Dakota Fanning is appropriately innocent and then conflicted and ultimately haunted as\u00a0Beverly Aadland, the chorus line extra that Flynn selects as a concubine and aggressively pursues. Susan Sarandon surely knows a thing or two about the kind of male behavior exhibited by stars like Flynn; she was packaged as a bombshell in her twenties. But you'd never know that from the committed way she plays Beverly's mother, Florence, who'd probably have put her own fame fantasies and monetary goals ahead of her daughter's mental health if she hadn't been conditioned to think that a young woman's first job is to land a successful man and subordinate her identity to his. The supporting roles are filled out by capable character actors, including Bryan Batt (Sal on \"Mad Men\"), Jane McNeill (\"The Walking Dead\") and, in a bit part, Max Casella as Stanley Kubrick during his pre-\"Lolita\" phase.\u00a0 Advertisement The problem\u2014and wow, it's a big one\u2014is that none of these actors have material firm enough to shape into a bona fide performance. The characterizations and dialogue are so early-90s TV-movie bland that not only can you not say that Kline is giving a good or bad performance, you can't even accurately describe what sort of performance he's trying to give. His Flynn consists of nothing more than handsomeness and a dashing grin and a charm that soon turns oily. As Florence, Sarandon is stuck in a one-note predatory stage mom part, with Fanning's Beverly as the prey. If special Oscars were given for Outstanding Performance in an Underwritten Role as an Abused and Self-Deceiving Young Woman, Fanning would be a lock to win it, but that's not the same thing as saying that the character is worth spending time with, or that the performance has much to do with the character as conceived by the filmmakers (she's mainly a collection of misfortunes wrapped in an array of splendid outfits). Nor is it possible to discern what, if anything, the filmmakers are trying to say about the sexism practiced in Hollywood then and now, and encoded in Hollywood's fantasies then and now, or the role that women like Florence played in perpetuating and validating the predatory practices of male movie stars, producers, studio heads and the like (she all but pushes her 15-year daughter into the arms of a man who was middle-aged when she was born).\u00a0 Nor does it seem to have any clear point of view on the fact that the movie star's first sexual encounter with Beverly is a rape. It's fine, from a dramatic standpoint, that Beverly fails to recognize it as a rape, and falls in love with Flynn anyway; their relationship was complicated, as they say now, and she was a naive kid, and it was a different time\u2014 one in which people did not always recognize flagrant abuses of power as such, and instead chalked them up to The Way Things Sometimes Are. What's not fine is that, by failing to think clearly about what happened, the movie's muddled storytelling takes a 1959 point-of-view on Flynn's exploitation of Beverly, treating it as just something that happened on the road to their troubled but still real love. It's not necessary to condescend to the recent past by asserting that current values are morally superior, but it would've been nice to see some recognition, preferably subtle, of the difference between how we'd characterize the rape now versus what the characters delude themselves into calling (a \"seduction\"). We're left thinking that the couple did all right considering the age difference and a rocky first date. The movie's point-of-view on the totality of the central relationship is just as bereft of wisdom. Although \"The Last of Robin Hood\" knowingly compares itself to Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita\" by having Flynn take a meeting with Casella's Kubrick, who adapted the film in 1962, it's just not in the same weight class as the novel or Kubrick's adaptation of same. \"Lolita\" had a buoyancy and irony and a boundless spirit of invention, plus a sense of the difference between how people describe their lives and what their lives actually amounted to. In comparison, \"Robin Hood\" is numbingly prosaic. You're just watching an aging sleaze take advantage of a 15-year old girl while her mother reaps whatever benefits she can. The movie offers no insight, no tragic poetry, no startling yet strangely right filmmaking touches, to compensate for the tawdriness. It's just a straightforward account of people enduring or creating misery. Advertisement There are many more failings, including a substandard budget (for a period picture) that could've been used imaginatively but instead seems stretched way, way too thin, and pedestrian storytelling, starting with a flash-forward announcing Flynn's death and then working through the fall-from-innocence storyline in a tediously literal way. \"The Last of Robin Hood\" is only worth seeing if you're fascinated by the sight of superb actors trying to make bricks without straw, as it were, and failing. This film is both sad and saddening. It could have amounted to so much more.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Meadowland", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cMeadowland\u201d hinges on an inciting incident so horrifying\r\nthat it\u2019s really unfathomable to imagine, even for those of us who have\r\nchildren. Conveying a grief that most people will never have to endure can be a\r\ndifficult task for a filmmaker, and they often fall back on over-telling such\r\nstories, making sure every line of dialogue and every shot selection drips with\r\npain. Such is the case with Reed Morano\u2019s directorial debut \u201cMeadowland,\u201d a film with two very\r\nstrong central performances from a pair of underrated actors that falters by being so self-aware of the tortured existence it\u2019s\r\nattempting to capture. In the end, it feels like Morano didn\u2019t trust her actors\r\nquite enough to be the conduits of emotion, falling back on too many filmmaking\r\nand screenwriting tropes that hamper the realism of their work. Advertisement Sarah (Olivia Wilde) and Phil (Luke Wilson) pull over at a\r\ngas station in the opening scene of \u201cMeadowland.\u201d Their son goes into the\r\nbathroom and doesn\u2019t come out. There was a door in the back of the restroom\r\nleading to the garage, the street, and the rest of the world, and he\u2019s gone\r\nwithout a trace. As a father of three, even writing that sentence sends chills\r\nup my spine. I can\u2019t imagine the pain. And \u201cMeadowland\u201d wastes no time jumping\r\ninto that bottomless well. This will be a movie about grief. This will be a\r\nmovie about suffering. \u201cMeadowland\u201d jumps forward a year to reveal Sarah and Phil\r\nquietly imploding over the disappearance. They try to go about relatively\r\nnormal lives\u2014Sarah is a teacher, Phil a cop\u2014but the lack of resolution seems to\r\nbe one of the most haunting elements of daily life. They can\u2019t even bury their\r\nchild. And cops come with pictures of children found on the internet or in\r\nraids and ask if it\u2019s their son. Sarah refuses to even look anymore, while Phil\r\nseems to hold out a glimmer of hope that he\u2019ll be found.  Sarah also happens to be a teacher, a far-too-convenient\r\nstorytelling device for Morano. In an early scene, her students are reading\r\npoetry about how your eyes adjust to the dark\u2014\u201cYou don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to be light again. It might just keep\r\ngetting darker.\u201d This kind of self-aware scripting pops up again and again\r\nin \u201cMeadowland.\u201d The movie actually works best when Sarah and Phil are silent,\r\nas Morano, a cinematographer by trade who also shot this film, captures the gloomy,\r\novercast existence of two people living in misery. The problems lie in Chris\r\nRossi\u2019s over-explanatory script, which almost seems to be pushing and pulling\r\nwith Morano\u2019s more dreamlike visual style and emotional skill with the actors. Advertisement Even the structure of \u201cMeadowland\u201d can be frustrating, as we\r\nwatch Sarah get closer to a student with Asperger\u2019s who is clearly unloved by\r\nhis parents and bullied at school. The idea that a teacher would be drawn to a surrogate\r\nson after losing her own is a fascinating one, but Rossi handles it in a clunky\r\nfashion, not really conveying what Sarah thinks she\u2019ll get out of the relationship.\r\nSimilarly, Phil meets a man (John Leguizamo) at a support group who has a dark\r\nstory of his own. Like the Sarah arc, it\u2019s a narratively frustrating element from the film's too-literal melodrama.\u00a0 Despite those frustrations, \u201cMeadowland\u201d is ample proof yet\r\nagain of the underutilized talents of Olivia Wilde and Luke Wilson. Wilde has a\r\nway of breaking through the overwritten dialogue to find the truth. Her quiet\r\nmoments in the classroom, lost in near-suicidal thought, say more about Sarah\u2019s\r\narc than any line in the film. Despite her striking beauty, she seems to be\r\nfolding in on herself, unable to live in the cruel world. She wears a hoodie, acting look like the air hurts her skin. Wilde is great here, and she\u2019s\r\nmatched by Luke Wilson, another actor who seems to be getting more confident\r\nand interesting with age.

{"Title": "Life Partners", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Why does it feel nearly revelatory to see a film that treats\r\nfemale friendship with respect? Not as a device to get one of the women hitched\r\nto the right guy and not as an undeveloped subplot to serve as comic relief\r\nuntil said protagonist walks down the aisle. This is at the heart of why \u201cBridesmaids\u201d\r\nwas such a smash success\u2014Kristen Wiig conveyed something truthful about female\r\ncharacters who felt like friends and not plot devices or the broad caricatures of so many Hollywood comedies. And yet we\u2019ve seen few\r\nfilms like it since. And so the moments of believability in the surprisingly\r\nentertaining \u201cLife Partners\u201d have greater resonance. Yes, the plot machinations\r\npuncture a bit of that believability balloon, but the honesty in this film\u2019s\r\ncore love triangle is something that other filmmakers, especially those\r\ninterested in telling stories about women, would be wise to copy. Advertisement Much of that truthfulness can be traced back to casting.\r\nGillian Jacobs was always entertaining on NBC\u2019s \u201cCommunity,\u201d but the hit show\r\nwas often stolen from her by more vibrant personalities like Donald Glover and\r\nDanny Pudi. Here, she proves, without question, that she can carry a film. She\u2019s\r\ngrounded and likable as Paige, best friend to Sasha (Leighton Meester). These\r\ntwo have a nearly co-dependent degree of friendship, talking every day on the\r\nphone, getting together to mock \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model,\u201d and helping each\r\nother through failed relationships. The core of \u201cLife Partners\u201d\u2014the friendship\r\nbetween Jacobs and Meester\u2014is surprisingly genuine, and it goes a long way to\r\nthe success of the overall film. Too many movies about friendship force actors\r\nor actresses who seem like they\u2019d never even talk over the Kraft Services table\r\nmuch less actually hang out to portray friends, and so the core of the film\r\nrings hollow. The core here is solid. And so we feel it when the friendship between Sasha and\r\nPaige is tested by the natural progression of life. Sasha has had nothing but bad luck in love, bouncing\r\nfrom relationship to relationship, and commiserating over her failures with her\r\nother lesbian friends like Jen (Gabourey Sidibe) and Jenn (Beth Dover). Paige\r\nhas seen her share of losers as well, and Tim (Adam Brody, who happens to be\r\nmarried to Meester in real life) looks like just another bad beau at first. He\r\nquotes \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d far too often to be a viable romantic candidate. And yet\r\nhe becomes one. He seems genuinely, sweetly interested in Paige, and the subtle way this\r\nrelationship unfolds is one of the strengths of \u201cLife Partners.\u201d It doesn\u2019t\r\nhappen overnight, as in so many Hollywood rom-coms. When these two fall in love, they do so gradually and believably. Before she knows it, Sasha has to make\r\nroom on the couch for Tim during their weekly \u201cTop Model\u201d snark-fests. And then\r\nPaige is missing them altogether. Paige pushes herself into uninteresting dates\r\n(with scene stealers like Kate McKinnon and Abby Elliott), as so often happens\r\nwhen our friends find partners; we seek out our own with more fervor. More than\r\nanything, \u201cLife Partners\u201d captures how romance alters friendship. We have to\r\nadjust to our friend\u2019s significant others, and realize that we may not be the\r\nmost important person in their life any more, even if they are still the most\r\nimportant person in ours. The first act feels a bit forced in some of its\r\ncharacter set-ups, but once \u201cLife Partners\u201d settles into a loose,\r\ncharacter-based groove, it really works (at least until it's forced out of that\r\nagain with some awkward plot turns in the final half-hour). It\u2019s a sad\r\ncommentary on how rarely we see female friendship that feels truthful in cinema\r\nthat this comes as such a pleasant surprise. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Tom at the Farm", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois filmmaker Xavier Dolan is only 26 years old and has already directed 5 features, 4 of which he wrote. Some he has acted in, some he has not. He has gotten the kind of attention young artists dream about, some good, some bad, festival awards, critical raves and critical derision. As an actor, Dolan has a blank and beautiful quality reminiscent of the young Alain Delon, whose almost otherworldly good looks were show-stopping and yet somehow off-putting as well (utilized to great effect in Jean-Paul Melville's \"Le Samoura\u00ef\"). Audiences are drawn to such cinematic beauty, but can also be envious, and slightly hostile. (Alfred Hitchcock loved to fill his films with beautiful people and then make horrible things happen to them.) Is there anything there behind that mask of pure beauty?\u00a0Dolan's latest, \"Tom at the Farm\" was completed several years ago (before last year's \"Mommy\") and is the first time he has adapted an extant work for the screen. Based on a play written by Michel Marc Bouchard (and Bouchard wrote the adaptation with Dolan), the adaptation appears to adhere closely to the original (I have not seen the play), with only a couple of scenes where the action is \"opened up.\" (Those scenes, on the whole, are not successful.) \"Tom at the Farm\" strains to be a psychological thriller but its length (102 minutes) dissipates the tension that should be taut and compressed. This is Dolan's first attempt at genre, and while there is much to admire here (mainly the visuals and the score, both stunning), Dolan's interests lie in the strange undercurrents of sado-masochism between the two main characters, and it's a through-line that deserves more attention. That through-line could have carried the entire movie if Dolan had let go of being faithful to the original.\u00a0Tom (Dolan) drives through serene and brightly-colored autumn fields to attend the funeral of his boyfriend Guillaume. Once he arrives and meets Guillaume's mother Agathe (Lise Roy, who gives the best performance in the film), he learns that his boyfriend was closeted to his mother and had lied that he had a girlfriend. Tom is a greasy-haired boy, dressed in black leather and huge black boots, clomping through the immaculate farmhouse and the rural surrounding environment, a slash of black against the yellow dying corn. Agathe is eager to meet someone who knew her son, but confused and hurt that the never-met girlfriend did not attend the funeral.\u00a0The emotional pressure in that farmhouse is so extreme that Tom is roped into going along with his dead boyfriend's lie. Tom closets himself, in other words. He decides not to read the shaky eulogy he is seen writing in the first image of the film. It's an uneasy choice for him to make. More problems arise when Francis (Pierre-Yves Cardinal), Guillaumes's swaggering older brother, who still lives at home with his mother, struts into the kitchen bare-chested, seething with hostility towards the blonde urban interloper. Francis knew his brother's secret life, has homophobic contempt for it, and has banned all of the gay friends from coming to the funeral (there's a confrontation with one of them at the back of the church). Francis is so intimidating, so awful really, that it's strange that Tom doesn't just leave immediately after the funeral. But the farm exerts a pull on Tom (the real story of the film). Tom is hypnotized into the dysfunctional workings of the family, their subverted energies working on him like a drug. He can't seem to leave. The only time he shows rage and frustration is when he is alone in his car after the funeral. Agathe becomes increasingly frayed. Francis picks fights with Tom, one particularly horrible one in the cornfield, with Tom getting torn to shreds by the razor-sharp dead corn stalks. In one terrible moment, Francis spits into Tom's open mouth. But one day, Francis teaches Tom how to milk cows. Then another day, Tom helps birth a calf, and cries with emotion afterwards. Francis reveals that he used to take dance classes, and in one haunting scene, Francis and Tom ballroom dance through the empty barn, Francis dipping Tom back gallantly, the scene moving to romantic slo-mo.\u00a0What Dolan appears to be going for is a portrait of what could be seen as Stockholm Syndrome or perhaps the beginnings of a possible folie \u00e0 deux\u00a0situation. Francis and Tom hate each other, want to be each other, role-reverse, flirt, lash out. Tom is relatively submissive to Francis, taking the beatings, even encouraging them, and Francis senses that, takes pleasure in it. There's a sexual dance going on throughout, reminiscent of the murdering duo Leopold and Loeb (especially in the portrayal of the characters in 1959's \"Compulsion\", highlighting the hypnotic cult-like Master-Slave dynamic), or the novels of Patricia Highsmith, filled with doubling isolated characters. Francis won't let Tom leave, throwing obstacles in his way. Tom's cell phone doesn't work. He doesn't just walk down to the main road and hitch a ride. He stays. Francis has no friends, Francis hates gay people, swaggers like a rooster, glories in his singularity. But Tom's beautiful blank face before him is dying\u00a0to be punched, or kissed, or marked in some way. These are the best sections of the film. It's really the story, and Dolan's intense interest in them is clear in the lingering way these scenes are shot.But as the film continues on and on (it's way too long), and Sarah (Evelyne Brochu), a city friend of Tom's shows up, pretending to be the girlfriend in order to put Agathe's mind at ease, \"Tom at the Farm\" unravels. There's not enough structure to these different threads. It could work on the stage where movement and place and time are necessarily compressed, but on film it feels artificial, not fully worked out.\u00a0Beautiful visuals abound throughout (Andr\u00e9 Turpin, who also shot \"Mommy\", is the cinematographer), and there's a moody high-contrast look to the landscape (bright trees and bright corn behind dark shadows and fog) that speaks of secrets, torment, hope. The lush and heavy-on-the-strings score of Gabriel Yared is a clue to what Dolan was after. The score punctuates all of the scenes, casual or intense, adding portentous emotion, tension, fear of what is coming. It's a melodramatic score, and \"Tom at the Farm\" works when it is a family melodrama. These are out-there people with outrageous emotional lives, subsisting on lies and denial, and the abyss between what they think their lives are and what their lives <i>really</i> are is enormous. All of them choose denial. They get tied to one another by their shared lies, and their unspoken agreement to keep on lying. The score supports that uneasy and terrible energy. The visuals, like the score, are exaggerated and stylistic, starting off with the helicopter shot following Tom's car into the countryside, making him seem dwarfed by the surrounding land, a tiny figure entering an unknown isolated world. It's a nod to Hitchcock or Kubrick.\u00a0The thriller elements, the chase scenes, the reveal of horrifying secrets, feel like add-ons, clumsily done and unmotivated, especially when compared to the dark and deep dance (metaphorical and literal) of violence and sex going on between Tom and Francis. That's the real juice and guts of the film. It could be an answer to the nagging question throughout: Why the hell doesn't Tom just leave? In thrillers, people are always making ridiculous choices that go against their self-interest, or ignoring the red flags in front of them of potential predators. In a well-done thriller, you mostly forgive the unreal quality of these moments. But \"Tom at the Farm\" does not foreground the thriller aspect enough (although the score tries mightily to do so), and so Tom doesn't seem quite real. Nobody does.

{"Title": "Man of Tai Chi", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Keanu Reeves has a mixture of stilted awkwardness and gangly grace that is uniquely his own, and that makes him an often strange, disaffected presence. This can either work or not work. His line readings are sometimes baffling. But his simple sense of truth and touching trust in the material (whatever it may be) is one of the reasons his career has lasted so long. There isn't a ton of ego in his work. It's refreshing.\u00a0 \"Man of Tai Chi\", Reeves' feature film directorial debut, has the same sometimes-awkward blend that Reeves brings to the table as an actor. The film is super serious (as befitting the martial arts genre, where everything is a matter of life or death), with moments of strange stilted dialogue (also par for the course) and scene after scene of thrilling physical combat, filmed with grace and certainty and no small amount of awe for the athletes involved. Advertisement Tiger Chen, a stuntman in the two \"Matrix\" sequels, plays the eponymous character, also named \"Tiger Chen\". He is a devoted practitioner of the ancient art of tai chi, working with a master named Yang (Yu Hai) in a beautiful temple. For his day job, Tiger works as a delivery boy, driving packages around the city, and flirting with a receptionist at one of his regular stop-offs. He lives with his parents. He does not have ambition to \"do anything\" with tai chi, because the rules underlying his apprenticeship with Master Yang say that those who practice tai chi do not do so for money, glory, or even to win. But during a public competition, his undeniable skill brings him to the attention of a mysterious individual named Donaka Mark (Reeves). Donaka lives in a cold man-cave of a penthouse, furnished in black leather and chrome. He strolls around barefoot on shiny black marble floors, he speaks only in terse commands. He has a security detail working for him that would rival the NSA's. He reaches out to Tiger, offering him a security job, when in reality it is a recruitment for a deadly underground fighting ring.  Tiger is flown to an undisclosed location, put into an empty grey room with a mirror on one wall, as he waits to see what will happen. A female voice commands: \"Fight\", and from out of nowhere an opponent grabs Tiger from behind. Tiger is then engaged in a fight for his life in that grey room with the big mirror, and it is an Alice-through-the-looking-glass moment which will bear fruit through the rest of the film: Like Alice, Tiger is catapulted from one strange experience to the next. The normal rules of regular life no longer apply.\u00a0 Donaka, of course, is watching through that mirror. That first fight is a test. Tiger passes, but it is only the first of many. Donaka's fight club is run like a cult, where essential information about the nature of the organization is withheld from the participants until they are too deeply embroiled to get out. Tiger finds himself back in that grey room again and again, fighting increasingly vicious and skilled opponents. To what purpose? What is it all for?  The money Donaka offers is substantial. When Master Yang's temple is slated for demolition unless money can be raised for necessary repairs, Tiger caves. And so the sacred temple is now being financed by someone who has betrayed the underlying principles taught there, a terrible irony. Tiger Chen, a superb athlete (to watch him is to go slack-jawed in wonder and appreciation), is also a terrific actor, going believably from sweet open kid to cold lean killer with a haunted aspect. \"Man of Tai Chi\" takes place in a deeply moral universe where our choices have spiritual implications.  Advertisement The fighting ring is illegal. The cops (one in particular) close in on Donaka, who remains elusive and omniscient. Donaka understands that tai chi is not the usual fare in the martial arts underground, and he gets off on the fact that Tiger has sold out. That's the turn-on, the power trip. Reeves isn't in the film all that much, and there are a couple of extremely stiff scenes of dialogue, but he does get a very impressive fight scene with Tiger near the end. This is Tiger Chen's picture all the way. You watch him transform, and you watch his soul go dark.  Cinematographer Elliot Davis films the fight scenes with thrilling immediacy: lots of long takes, so you realize you are actually seeing these guys actually do this, as opposed to watching something pieced together later in the editing room. The camera circles and rises and pulls back, moving horizontally and vertically with the movements of each fight. The filming is intuitive and visceral. There's one masterpiece of a scene that takes place in a hidden night club floating in the bowels of a cargo ship in Hong Kong harbor. The setting is surreal: the circular stage painted with psychedelic dizzying swirls and the circular tables surrounding said stage, not to mention the bored elegant silent crowd, is reminiscent of the midnight theatre scene in David Lynch's \"Mulholland Drive\" or the freaky tiered nightclub in Josef von Sternberg's \"Shanghai Gesture\". Each fight gets more dangerous. The stakes rise. Death is the only possible outcome.  Reeves approaches the genre with respect and passion.  \"Man of Tai Chi\" is hugely entertaining.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Before I Go to Sleep", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Christine Lucas (Nicole Kidman) wakes up every day thinking\r\nthat she\u2019s 15 years younger than her actual age. She doesn\u2019t recognize the man\r\nlying next to her. The 40-year-old in the mirror doesn\u2019t look right. She\u2019s not\r\neven sure where she is. Not unlike Guy Pearce\u2019s memorable lead in \u201cMemento,\u201d\r\nChristine has psychogenic amnesia. She was in a car accident over a decade ago.\r\nSince that day, she has rebooted after every night\u2019s sleep. She doesn\u2019t\r\nremember anything that happened the day before, and only gets occasional flashes\r\nof memory of the past 14 years. Her husband Ben (Colin Firth) has to go through\r\nthe same routine every morning, helped by photos on the bathroom wall with\r\nPost-Its like \u201cBen, Your Husband.\u201d Each day, Ben explains Christine\u2019s\r\npredicament to her, as he goes to work and she sits around the house, waiting\r\nfor the next night\u2019s restart button. Advertisement From the very beginning of \u201cBefore I Go to Sleep,\u201d this premise\r\nfeels faulty, at best. As directed by Rowan Joffe (\u201cBrighton Rock\u201d), the\r\nopening scenes make it clear that this is not a\r\nfilm with actual characters or relatable people within it. There\u2019s no exhaustion\r\nin Ben\u2019s voice, as there would be having done this routine every single day. Everything\r\nabout the moment reeks of manipulative set-up instead of something real, and\r\nthat feeling that you\u2019re being as played with as Christine herself. \u201cBefore I\r\nGo to Sleep\u201d is a movie with nothing to hold on to but a paper-thin mystery\r\nwith really only one of two possible suspects in the end.  As you can guess, there\u2019s more to Christine\u2019s story than Ben\u2019s\r\ninitial explanation. After her husband leaves for work, she gets a call from\r\nDr. Nasch (Mark Strong), a neuropsychologist who has been working with her for\r\nthe past few weeks. He tells her to find the digital camera in the back of her wardrobe.\r\nShe\u2019s been recording revelations every day, reminding herself of what she\u2019s\r\ndiscovered about Ben, her \u201caccident\u201d and more. She hasn\u2019t lost her memory from\r\na car accident. She was brutally attacked. By whom? Why? And what else is Ben\r\nkeeping from her? How much could you trust someone who you think is a stranger\r\neven if he tells you he\u2019s not? Of course, every question in a film like this has an answer.\r\nIt\u2019s a screenwriting exercise more than a film. It\u2019s hollow, the kind of quick\r\nbeach read that could satisfy on a summer vacation (and was based on such a\r\nbook) but Joffe hasn\u2019t justified transitioning it to the big screen. There\u2019s no\r\nedge, no pulp, no grit under its fingernails.  Part of the problem is that Joffe seems bored by his own\r\nmaterial. \u201cBefore I Go to Sleep\u201d needed to be stylish to play like a classic\r\nthriller or edgy to replicate the sense of confusion inherent in Christine\u2019s\r\nsituation. It\u2019s neither. The film is visually flat, disappointingly shot mostly\r\nin boring close-ups as one of the three central actors explains what\u2019s\r\nhappening now. And Joffe and his team try to increase the film\u2019s intensity with\r\nboring, cheap sound design, with multiple occasions of trucks that barely miss\r\nChristine as she\u2019s crossing the street or quick cuts to a loud, overhead plane.\r\nIt\u2019s supposed to be unsettling. It\u2019s just cheap. Advertisement Partially by virtue of its piling-up revelations and dual\r\nsuspect structure (only Ben or Dr. Nasch could be the \u201cbad guy\u201d since there\u2019s\r\nno one else in the movie that seems to matter, especially not a character named Claire who really could have been named Plot Device), \u201cBefore I Go to Sleep\u201d is a\r\nfilm that\u2019s constantly explaining itself to you. Here\u2019s what Christine knows now. Here\u2019s the latest revelation. Here\u2019s\r\nhow she feels about it. Every scene is designed to push you to a new\r\nrevelation. Honestly, I longed for just one scene of everyday life in Christine\u2019s\r\nexistence to add an ounce of realism to the production. It\u2019s a film with no\r\ncharacters. To be fair, the fact that Kidman gets this much honest emotion out of\r\nthis script is a testament to her skill level. With a lesser actress, the\r\nresult would be even more disingenuous. She gives it her all. The movie just\r\ngives nothing back to her.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "From Nowhere", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Back in the day when socially-conscious cinema also had a shot at finding a mainstream audience, some films in that category used the phrase \u201ctorn from today\u2019s headlines\u201d to add a little marketing sizzle. \u201cFrom Nowhere,\u201d which is about three teenage high-schoolers in the Bronx facing deportation because of their undocumented status, is clearly a movie of that ilk, although given the contemporary mode of socially conscious movies, to advertise itself as such would be unforgivably crass. Like most such pictures made in the U.S. today, this is an indie that keeps its indignation under tight wraps, a message picture that tries to convert the nonbelievers in the audience by presenting its message in the most polite way possible. Of course, the people who would most benefit from exposure to the message\u2014that undocumented aliens in the United States are, for the most part, people like you and me, as opposed to inhuman ISIS sleeper agents\u2014are not the kind of people who\u2019d go to an indie message movie.  Advertisement To tell you the truth, I\u2019m not someone who\u2019d go see an indie message movie myself, not anymore. I\u2019ve seen too many of them and I didn\u2019t get into movies for the social consciousness in the first place. That said, \u201cFrom Nowhere,\u201d directed by Matthew Newton from a screenplay by Newton and Kate Ballen, is an entirely watchable and sometimes engaging effort that serves as a great showcase for both the new and more seasoned members of its cast. The picture opens with Julianne Nicholson, as a high school teacher named Jackie, trying to get Shakespeare across to her students. They are typically uninterested, except for Moussa (J. Mallory McCree), who hits her with some on-target observations on King Lear. Moussa is one of three students to whom Jackie, working slightly under the radar of her school superiors, has recommended to an immigration lawyer played by Denis O\u2019Hare. The others are Raquel Castro\u2019s Alyssa, the school\u2019s valedictorian, from Peru, and Octavia Chavez-Richmond\u2019s Sophie, a Dominican girl. Moussa\u2019s family is from Guinea, and seems to have the most traumatic past. Which is a good thing, according to O\u2019Hare\u2019s lawyer. \u201cGenocide, genital mutilation, and dictators\u201d are three things immigration judges love to hear about, he advises them brusquely in an early scene. Once he discharges them back into the world, the trio has trouble enough navigating the narratives of their own chaotic lives, let alone constructing a credible narrative to bring before a court.  Moussa\u2019s conflicts with his mother result in a stand-off neither wants. His problems with his girlfriend are exacerbated by his concern for Sophie. Sophie is hiding, from everyone, a home life that included blatant sexual harassment if not outright abuse. The tension spills out into everyone\u2019s social lives, leading to one intense confrontation with beat cops over nothing. But nothing could become everything if even one of these kids is hauled off to a precinct house, and the film is at its most effective when it\u2019s conveying the quiet terror of such scenarios. Like so many socially-conscious movies, this one\u2019s schematic nature, the better with which to make its points, shows its hand a little too blatantly at times. While Moussa and Sophie\u2019s stories are well-fleshed-out, Alyssa\u2019s is neglected for the most part, until the very end, at which point it\u2019s used to play a \u201cwhat incredible and sad irony\u201d card. O\u2019Hare\u2019s lawyer, initially a bit of a cartoon, grows in both written dimensionality and portrayal, and the one-on-one scene between him and Chavez-Richmond is an undeniable highlight. \u201cFrom Nowhere\u201d is not a visionary work, and I don\u2019t think it aims to be; but it sets a coherent agenda from the get-go and manages to make a credible and disquieting narrative out of that.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "On My Way", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Defiantly episodic and inconsistent when it comes to character, the frustrating \"On My Way\" seeks to test the commonly held belief that Catherine Deneuve makes anything she's in better. The living legend certainly deserves little blame for this misfire but she can't handle the heavy lifting required by a script and director that feel as unfocused as the film's protagonist for at least an hour. And by the time the film's rambling narrative finally solidifies, it will be too late for all but the most diehard Deneuve admirers.  Advertisement Why make one late-life crisis movie when you can make eight? Emmanuelle Bercot's third film opens with a promising shot of Bettie (Deneuve) walking down a beach. There's a flash of a younger Bettie, winner of a local beauty contest, and she stridently turns around, heading in the other direction with notably more confidence. The intent is clear. Change, likely related to her past, is about to push Bettie off her chosen course. Sadly, Bercot and co-writer Jerome Tonnere take too long to find the path to send her on and are too tonally inconsistent to make the journey interesting for audiences.  Bettie's staid life as a restaurant owner who lives with her mother is upended when she learns that the marriage of her former lover is ending. Memories of a doomed romance (along with the pending reunion of former beauty queens that Bettie resists attending) send her into a tailspin. She starts smoking again and essentially runs away from home. What follows is a series of road trip episodes like a conversation with an elderly gentlemen rolling cigarettes, a one-night stand with a younger man, an interlude with a store owner who provides shelter from the rain, and, inevitably, a return to family. As in most films like this, Bettie learns that running away from emotion and familial turmoil can only be temporary. We always return to those who know us best.  Much of Bettie's emotional upheaval is internal and Deneuve does her best to sell this character's inconsistent behavior but Bercot does her no favors at all, at least in the first act. After the revelation about her former lover, Bettie drives around crying as Rufus Wainwright blares from the soundtrack, trying to underline emotion that the script hasn't earned. We don't know why Bettie is so upset and Bercot doesn't really bother to tell us. And it's a pattern throughout the film as poor Deneuve is bounced around from episode to episode, never developing a character that feels genuine within the many plot contrivances. The first hour, in particular, is a jumbled mess of tones, lurching from one scene to another with little at all to connect them other than the film's still-engaging lead. With such a legendary star in the center and new faces for her to encounter, it almost feels like an acting challenge: \"Let's see what Catherine can make out of this.\"  Advertisement Even the filmmaking feels tonally adrift, especially in the first half, as some scenes have a languid, melancholy pace while others are played for bizarre comedy, especially some awkwardly written scenes with Bettie's grandson. It's as if Bercot was trying to make a film as adrift as her lead, which simply doesn't work if we can't identify with or even understand the motivations of poor Bettie.  The second half of the film becomes more old-fashioned and notably more effective as Bettie reconnects with her family. While the contrivances can still frustrate, Deneuve is given a chance to finally develop a character in scenes with the playful Nemo Schiffman as her grandson and charismatic Gerard Garouste as the boy's paternal grandfather. The idea that a chapter in Bettie's life had to be closed for her to start another one recalls that opening scene on the beach and hints at the film that could have been buried in \"On My Way\" if it didn't take such a long and winding path to get there.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Sacrament", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Low-budget horror tyro Ti West evokes Jonestown for a generation of viewers too young to remember the place, or the horrific event named for it, in \"The Sacrament.\" West is such a technically accomplished filmmaker, and his cast of semi-regulars so committed to the narrative, that the resultant movie gives enough unsettling atmosphere and upsetting gut-level shock that this viewer didn\u2019t mind too much all the stuff he wasn\u2019t getting, such as intellectual coherence, not to mention any kind of profound insight into the cult hive mind. Advertisement West sets his story in the present day. The movie\u2019s weakest sequence is its opening, done in faux-televised video style with static-punctuated jump cuts, showing a meeting at the offices of edgy media entity Vice (a written prologue explaining to the audience what Vice is ought to win a prize for Lamest Prose To Appear In A Motion Picture Nearly Ever) at which \"fashion photographer\" Patrick (Kentucker Audley) recounts to beardo editor Sam (A.J. Bowen) that his formerly drugged-out sister has quit the United States to live at some kind of sober commune that sounds kind of like a cult. Sam smells a story, so he, Patrick, and videographer Jake (filmmaker Joe Swanberg) set off to \"Eden Parish\" to check out the scene. There they find Patrick\u2019s sister Caroline (Amy Seimetz), now bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and clean, but a little freaked out by greeting a shoestring camera crew. She\u2019ll have to check with \"Father\" to see if these documentarians may be permitted to document. Folks of a certain age, or those who know a bit about nasty episodes in U.S. history, will have some idea of where this is going. The expression \"drank the Kool Aid,\" although historically inaccurate, has its roots in the Jonestown affair. Is that a spoiler? In any event, the intrigue is less in the tale than in the telling. The setup for the film suggests a \"Blair Witch\" style found-footage picture, but West wisely avoids that route. Yes, much of what we see is through the perspective of Jake, but as his character\u2019s a professional, it makes sense that the resultant digital video imagery straddles the ground between found-footage style rawness and more polished feature documentary style. This allows West the stylistic latitude to be more overtly expressive in his imagery. And to set up interestingly corresponding visuals against character observations such as \"this is nothing at all like the hippie commune we were expecting.\" Indeed, it is not, and the movie gains much power via the performance of the cast\u2019s oldest principal player, Gene Jones as the homey but steely \"Father.\" Jones has a background in voiceover, and his rich, mellifluous Southern tones imbue his character with a coziness that can turn sinister on a dime. In his eagerness to get on with the awfulness, West risks some plausibility complaints. The real Jonestown imploded after a year of investigations into the Guyana commune led by the Reverend Jim Jones (who, back in the day, was the subject of several fictionalized accounts, including the memorably titled \"Guyana: Cult of the Damned\"); in \"The Sacrament,\" they\u2019re mixing up the fruit drink after one night of scrutiny from the Vice crew. I know that people consider male urban hipster journalists pretty irritating, but come on. Once things build to a sickly conclusion, West takes advantage of the momentum to indulge in some pretty crass grindhouse exploitations. For all that, the movie gets its disreputable work done; not only will \"The Sacrament\" creep you out, it\u2019ll also make you want to shower. That\u2019s not nothing.

Adri\u00e1n Garc\u00eda Bogliano\u2019s \u201cLate Phases\u201d\r\ntells just such a story, sketching a horror-comedy about a grizzled Vietnam vet\r\nnamed Ambrose (Nick Damici), who moves to a community that seems to run into\r\ntrouble every 30 or so days with each full moon. Bogliano can\u2019t quite manage\r\nthe tones of the film, resulting in a frustrating piece of work overall, but\r\nDamici gives his memorable protagonist enough life to hold it together more\r\noften that it would have otherwise. He\u2019s great here. The movie around him, not\r\nso much. Advertisement Writing a horror film with a blind, elderly Vietnam vet as\r\nits protagonist is a risky proposition, but Damici rises to the challenge as\r\nAmbrose, a man we meet moving to a new community with his dog Shadow and the\r\nhelp of his son Will (Ethan Embry). As he\u2019s feeling the wall of his new abode,\r\nAmbrose pulls a massive claw from the wall. Something\u2019s not right behind these\r\npicket fences. The local older women initially take to Ambrose\u2019s rugged\r\npersona, but he soon rubs them the wrong way with his tendency to say what\u2019s on\r\nhis mind and brandish a loaded weapon. Ambrose doesn\u2019t make friends easily. And\r\nhe doesn\u2019t seem to care. He just wants to live out his final days with his dog\r\nand his peace and quiet. Of course, that\u2019s interrupted the first night he\u2019s there by\r\nan attack on the kind woman living next door. Ambrose hears the fight, in which\r\nwe see a man-sized wolf tear an old woman apart\u2014those turned off by gore might\r\nwant to stay away\u2014and he\u2019s quickly a part of the attack when Shadow gets\r\ninvolved, and ends up dead. One night in his new community, and Ambrose has to\r\nbury his only remaining companion. Naturally, he\u2019s pissed. And he\u2019s going to\r\nget to the bottom of the \u201canimal attacks\u201d in his new community. The cops don\u2019t\r\ncare. The suburban sprawl has extended near the forest and they\u2019re eager to\r\nwrite off the concerns of the older residents as animal attacks. Ambrose knows\r\nmore is going on, and tries to figure out who may be a creature of the night\r\nwhen the moon turns full. Could it be the kindly Priest (Tom Noonan)? Time to\r\nget some silver bullets, build a cross, and find out. The way that society discards its elderly, represented by\r\nEmbry\u2019s distant son and the dismissive authorities in this community, adds an\r\ninteresting subtext to Bogliano\u2019s film. And Ambrose\u2019s background does some of\r\nthe same, painting this battle with the supernatural as one last trip in the country for the veteran. He may be blind, he may be old, and he may have\r\nregrets, but this thing killed his dog and he\u2019s going to do what's right, goddammit. Damici finds just the\r\nright energy for the role, never overplaying Ambrose's potentially scenery-chewing traits. In fact, it\u2019s how\r\nseriously Damici plays the part that allows it to work. He never winks at the\r\ncamera as a lot of other actors would have. He takes Ambrose\u2019s\r\nplight seriously. Advertisement Sadly, I can\u2019t quite say the same about Bogliano. He never quite convinced me that he figured what kind of film he was trying to make. A lot of\r\nthe creature design is misguided (exaggerated and goofy more than scary), and some of the tonal jumps are jarring. The\r\nfilm goes from character-driven drama with Ambrose and his new religious\r\nexploration late in life to remarkably gory horror to something that plays\r\nmore like a horror-comedy with one-liners that would have worked in \u201cBubba\r\nHo-Tep.\u201d I think the various tones in Eric Stolze\u2019s script proved more of a\r\nchallenge than Bogliano expected. Balancing horror, comedy and drama in a way\r\nthat makes all three effective is incredibly difficult. All three typically end\r\nup getting less attention than they need.", "Critic": "Beta"}

Early in \u201cThe Wolfpack,\u201d the older boys ask if she got up to their\r\napartment OK, as if something bad would happen to her in the lobby, and are excited to cook\r\ndinner for their special guest. It\u2019s clear from Moselle\u2019s verit\u00e9 style, in\r\nwhich she doesn\u2019t often seem to ask follow-up questions but let the boys come\r\nto their own emotional conclusions, that she was very concerned about these\r\nyoung men, as anybody would be. But the arms-length approach can be\r\nfrustrating. There are times when the Angulos seem to be directing \u201cThe\r\nWolfpack\u201d more than Moselle, and it\u2019s an incredible story that would have benefited\r\nfrom a surer hand. Despite the sense sometimes that Moselle isn\u2019t driving \u201cWolfpack\u201d\r\nin the way needed to make it truly work, she undeniably finds some beautiful\r\nmoments in the trajectory of the Angulos, although they are sometimes so\r\nfleeting as to frustrate when they aren\u2019t further developed. The most striking\r\nmoment comes when an Angulo says that \u201cWe\r\nwere frightened kids\u2026that\u2019s one of the first memories I have,\u201d when\r\ndiscussing the abusive Oscar, who one claims ended every fight with mom with a\r\nslap. Moselle then cuts to a figure of Mukunda, the most reflective of the\r\nboys, in a detailed Batman costume, before reenacting \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d Do the\r\nboys relate to macho, male-driven films because they haven\u2019t had a decent male\r\nrole model in their lives? Are they drawn to the melancholy of Nolan\u2019s take on\r\nthe character because it reflects their own?  Much of \u201cThe Wolfpack\u201d is undeniably moving, especially as\r\nthe boys come out into the real world, frightened and unsure of themselves.\r\nThey see \u201cbig f**king trees\u201d and\r\ncompare them \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d They see \u201cThe Fighter\u201d and are happy that\r\ntheir ticket money will go to Christian Bale. There\u2019s a na\u00efve, heartwarming\r\napproach to the power of cinema in \u201cThe Wolfpack\u201d that clearly appealed to the\r\ncinephiles in Park City.  Could Moselle have found a way to make this incredible story\r\ninto an incredible film? Part of the problem may be that she came upon the\r\nAngulos at the time they were emerging from their near imprisonment and that\r\nmade her hesitant to pry into their pasts for fear of placing blocks in what seems like a road to recovery, as anybody would be. When mom says\r\nthat she grew up in the Midwest and thinks public school \u201csocialization\u201d is not\r\nthat good, anybody would almost feel impolite to pry further into her\r\nbackground or the falsity of that belief. And yet that\u2019s what separates great documentaries\r\nfrom good ones.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Omar", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The separation wall runs through occupied Palestine, intimidating and omnipresent, covered with snarky graffiti, reminiscent of the Berlin Wall in its final days. A striking image of the wall opens Hany Abu-Assad's Oscar-nominated film \"Omar\", Abu-Assad's first Palestinian feature since \"Paradise Now\" in 2005. Omar (Adam Bakri) is seen grappling up a dangling rope, scaling the sheer face of the wall, before scrambling over to drop down to the other side. The wall will be used again and again in \"Omar\", first to show Omar's training as a revolutionary (once he gets out of practice, it becomes a huge struggle to make it up that wall), and also to symbolize the ways that the wall separates Palestinians not only from Israelis but also from one another. The wall makes things like love, loyalty, connection and intimacy impossible. Advertisement \"Omar\" is a thriller and a romance with unabashedly melodramatic elements (there's even a love triangle), all of which are brought into stark relief by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Helped along by an amazing cast of mostly first-time actors, \"Omar\" feels very fresh due to its attitude, approach, and the fact that it offers no solutions. It's the story of three childhood friends caught up in a war that seemingly has no end. They are torn between their individual desires to have a home, a girlfriend, a family, and their devotion to the freedom of Palestine. In such an atmosphere, their best qualities will be used against them; their love for one another makes them vulnerable to betrayal. Omar is played by Adam Bakri, a new actor with barely any credits. He is open, accessible, handsome, and incredibly physical; the film requires him to run, leap and tightrope-walk his way along high walls. Omar is a baker, who spends his free time training for an upcoming operation against the Israelis with his two childhood friends, Tarek (Eyad Hourani) and Amjad (Samer Bisharat). They appear to be working independently of any established group. Later, when Omar is in prison, one of the other prisoners says to him, by way of introduction, \"I'm with Hamas. What group are you with?\" Being part of a group gives you protection and legitimacy, but Omar is more of a street kid, doing target practice in the woods with his two pals. Their plan is to kill an Israeli soldier in a nearby garrison, an act both reckless and meaningless. But they feel powerless, and the daily humiliations they endure, including random stop-and-searches, have taken their toll. They feel the need to do something to participate in the fight. Amjad is the one who pulls the trigger, killing a random Israeli soldier. Omar is chased through the streets the following day and finally arrested and brought to prison. Into the film strolls Agent Rami (the fantastic Waleed F. Zuaiter), who had posed as an Arab prisoner at first, striking up a gentle conversation with Omar in the prison cafeteria, in which Omar says the fateful words, \"I will never confess.\" This, of course, is seen as a confession, and Omar is strung up naked in a pitch-black interrogation room and tortured. He is finally offered a deal by Agent Rami: They will release Omar on the condition that Omar will hand them Tarek. Omar is devastated and panicked, and yet hopeful that he can work both sides. Advertisement Omar's main source of happiness before his imprisonment was Nadja (Leem Lubany), the younger sister of Tarek, the leader of their little street gang. Omar and Nadja meet secretly, passing notes to one another when they think no one is looking. They make tentative plans to get married, shyly looking at a one-roomed apartment together, unable to say the words \"the bed can go here\" without blushing. They have to keep their relationship a secret because their world is so traditional, and they are both so young. There is a fondness, affection and teasing humor in their dynamic that is heart-rending and sweet, adolescent and optimistic, and while it is obviously doomed, you don't know from where the doom will come. As Omar's situation becomes more and more dangerous, and as Omar's reputation becomes tarnished, Nadja starts to fear for her life. She wonders if it's true what is being whispered in the alleyways of her neighborhood. If Omar is collaborating with the Israelis then he is not the man she thought he was. Love is not easy in the best of times, but in the worst of times it is flat-out dangerous. Being a warrior requires hardness and emotional armor. Omar is not hard. He is open and vulnerable, and those qualities are his very best. He is kind, funny, easygoing, and able to give himself over to love fully. It's not an overstatement to suggest that these are the qualities that make him a credit to the human race and its positive potential. Without those qualities, we are all doomed. But such openness cannot be allowed to flourish in a treacherous war-torn atmosphere where betrayal is required. Betrayal is the theme of the film. Omar is forced to betray his political convictions, in order to work with Agent Rami (their couple of scenes together are among the best in the film), and Nadja struggles with betrayal as well as her loyalties start to shift. Hany Abu-Assad is, of course, interested in the situation of Palestine, and how the occupation impacts the lives of the people who live there. In \"Omar\" he rejects the macro view, and stays strictly within the micro, keeping close to his main character, observing the daily rhythms of the occupation, and the daily weirdness of living under the shadow of that huge wall. The larger concerns of a group like Hamas are nearly invisible. Early in the film, we see the three friends letting off steam together\u2014throwing around dirty jokes, Amjad entertaining them with his hilarious Marlon Brando imitation (it is pretty funny)\u2014and it slowly becomes impossible to imagine the friends ever finding their way back to such an innocent dynamic. That is what is lost in such a war. That is what is sacrificed. The war seeps down into the molecules, the spaces in-between language. It is in people's thoughts and dreams. When Omar and Nadja discuss escaping that world together after marriage they can barely imagine leaving their neighborhood. Those dreams hover, like a mirage. Maybe they'd like to go to Paris, but you see they can't really believe in it. The separation wall is not just a hated structure in the Palestinian landscape. It is within the hearts and minds of the characters. And that's the tragedy.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}

There\u2019s the event itself, designed to amaze audiences with its \u201ccould that really happen\u201d intensity. And there\u2019s the\r\nrecovery final act, in which the world has changed for the characters and they\r\nhave to struggle to get back together. It\u2019s a structure that can be underappreciated\r\nin that if any of these three acts are too long or poorly done, the suspension\r\nof disbelief is punctured and a disaster movie becomes, well, a disaster\r\nitself. What\u2019s interesting about \u201cThe Wave\u201d is stepping back and considering\r\njust how well-constructed the whole thing is. The slow-burn build-up is just\r\nlong enough, the disaster itself is just harrowing enough and the final act is\r\njust intense enough to keep us engaged. It\u2019s what one would call a \u201csturdy\u201d genre pic\u2014it doesn\u2019t break any ground (pun kinda intended), but it gets the job done. Advertisement Geiranger is one of the most coveted tourist spots in all of\r\nNorway. It\u2019s easy to see why. The gorgeous views of the mountains and its crystal\r\nclear lakes bring new travelers every year. Of course, as the opening news\r\nfootage warns us, any village at the base of a mountain, especially one as big\r\nas \u00c5kerneset, is a ticking time bomb. Over ominous footage of landslides\r\nhurtling towards small towns, we hear \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the\r\nnext big disaster.\u201d If we\u2019ve learned anything from cinema, it\u2019s that Mother\r\nNature hates you and is going to kill you. It\u2019s a wonder we don\u2019t all live in\r\nshelters. The canary in this coalmine is Kristian (Kristoffer Joner),\r\nthe most vigilant employee at a Geiranger warning center. What\u2019s a warning\r\ncenter, you ask? Well, the likelihood of a rockslide, and the accompanying wave\r\nthat would come careening through the valley should enough water be displaced,\r\ndemands a staff of people who monitor the land and water. Kristian is leaving\r\nhis post, moving to the city with his wife and kids. Of course, he leaves a day\r\ntoo late. First, there are just some odd readings about groundwater on the\r\nmountain disappearing. Then there\u2019s Kristian\u2019s realization that the substratum are shifting so drastically that an avalanche is inevitable. Of course, the\r\nrest of his staff just think he\u2019s crying wolf. There isn\u2019t a movie if they\u2019re\r\nnot apprehensive, when, in reality, they\u2019d probably be dying to push the big\r\nred button that launches the siren that warns Geiranger that they have ten\r\nminutes before they\u2019re underwater. \u201cThe Wave\u201d hits all of the right beats for its genre. There\u2019s\r\nthe foreboding score as the camera slowly zooms in on Kristian\u2019s face behind\r\nthe wheel, stopped in traffic and just realizing what the latest readings\r\nmeant. There are shots of birds flying in the other direction of the mountain.\r\nThere\u2019s even a great scene in which one of the analysts is watching a slasher\r\nmovie on his laptop as lights start to blink red behind him. The Jason Voorhees\r\nof \u201cThe Wave\u201d is Mother Nature. If there's a criticism of the structure here, it's that the build-up act of \u201cThe Wave\u201d is a little too long. After\r\nKristian knows something is afoot, and we clearly know that he\u2019s right, there\u2019s\r\na bit too much wheel-spinning before we get to the titular event. However, said\r\nevent does not disappoint. Kristian and his daughter are headed for higher\r\nground while his wife and son are at the hotel at which she works, trying to\r\nget residents to safety before getting trapped in an underground bunker. When\r\nthe wave hits, it does so with biblical force, and director Roar Uthaug does an\r\nexcellent job of keeping the danger tactile.

{"Title": "I Am Not Your Negro", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Raoul Peck's \"I Am Not Your Negro\" is a political statement and a deep look into the mind of James Baldwin, one of the 20th century's greatest writers and social critics. It is also an unusual and striking cinematic biography with a specific mission: to show America through the eyes of an African-American, scattering shreds of hope amid horror, exasperation and disgust.\u00a0  The film is built around material that was created largely by its subject (the voice-over narration, read by Samuel L. Jackson, comes from Baldwin's last, unfinished novel), and Peck illustrates much of it with documentary and news footage, vintage photos, news clippings and onscreen text. And yet we don't get all that much imagery of Baldwin himself. This choice might might seem puzzling at first he was, after all, one of the few prominent African-American intellectuals who were regular presences on network TV in the 1960s, and from what little we see of those moments (the highlights include some choice bits from \"The Dick Cavett Show\") it's clear that Peck could have built a satisfying feature just around James Baldwin the camera subject: that's how authoritative he was.  Advertisement But this decision and others make sense as the film unfolds. \"I Am Not Your Negro\" is not interested in giving us the full arc of Baldwin's life. It is mainly interested in presenting how he saw and wrote about the world. And it does it with imagination, sensitivity, and passion tempered by sorrow. The bits of Baldwin's novel that have been turned into narration focus on the 1960s, with the murders of John F. Kennedy, Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. serving as milestones in despair. Along this historical clothesline, Peck strings a series of observations and anecdotes, sly asides and words of wisdom, and tries to reconcile the difference between what the United States says it stands for and what it actually does.  We hear Baldwin's conflicted, evolving reaction to the Civil Rights movement (including the internal debates about violent vs. nonviolent resistance) and interracial relationships (the hero of Baldwin's novel tells a story about how he and his first serious girlfriend, a white girl, used to leave the site of their trysts individually, several minutes apart, then sit far apart from each other on subway cars). Baldwin tells us what he thinks the carefully constructed images of Doris Day, John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Ray Charles, Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte reveal about how white Americans see themselves and others. We get his take on mid-century American attitudes towards the Horatio Alger myth (exactly that, a myth), capitalism (a way of putting numbers above all else), mainstream entertainment (a narcotic) and the possibility of reconciliation between the races (slim, unless whites come to grips with the full impact of slavery and Jim Crow). And he treats us to snippets of highly personal film criticism that searches movies for evidence of the mentality of the culture that made it. The highlight is a bit where Baldwin describes a black audience's reaction to the scene in Stanley Kramer's interracial buddy movie \"The Defiant Ones,\" where Tony Curtis' white chain gang inmate falls off a train and Poitier's character leaps off to help him: the crowd yelled at Poitier, \"What are you doing?\"  Peck miscaculates, I think, in lifting us out of the 20th century and linking many of Baldwin's observations about his own time to events and cultural developments that occurred after his death. Mixed in with the historical footage and photos and the scenes from old movies are bits from trashy daytime talk shows and reality TV shows, and images that allude to the financial meltdown of 2008, the Ferguson uprising, Barack Obama's election, and the presidential campaign of 2016. These elements don't damage the movie too terribly. But they do break the spell Peck weaves. And there are times when the present-tense stuff diminishes the timelessness of Baldwin's observations by connecting them too bluntly to American life in the second decade of the new millennium. Like Baldwin's writing, this movie will always be relevant, and yet here it is, dating itself.  Advertisement No matter: Baldwin's voice as a writer comes through powerfully anyway. It was wise to have Jackson read Baldwin's words plainly in his own voice, rather than attempt an impersonation. This decision shines a spotlight on the work, which is where the spotlight should always be in a movie about an artist. And it draws intuitive but general connections between Baldwin's life and Baldwin's fictionalization of it, without making any claims that the text itself can't support.  Turning Baldwin into a chorus and occasionally a bystander in a story drawn from his own experience proves to be a masterstroke as well. Baldwin is bearing witness in the narration, and Peck turns him into a witness onscreen, too, briefly putting up pictures of Baldwin alongside politicians and artists but never holding them for long, and locating Baldwin within photo montages of important, sorrowful events (such as King's funeral), establishing that he was there but never privileging his grief over the grief of others. This is not a portrait of one man, James Baldwin, but of the nation he wrote about, as seen through his eyes. It's a film that bears witness to a writer bearing witness.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Risen", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Risen,\" about a Roman soldier searching for the resurrected Christ in the 40 days following the crucifixion, is an old-fashioned Biblical spectacular with fresh blood in its veins. \u00a0As directed by Kevin Reynolds (\"Waterworld,\" \"Fandango\") and co-written by Reynolds and Paul Aiello, you could program it in a triple feature with \"The Robe\" and \"King of Kings.\"\u00a0It has battle sequences, CinemaScope images of scrub-dotted plains and hills, a swelling orchestral score by Roque Ba\u00f1os that sometimes evokes the late, great John Barry (\"Out of Africa\"), white English actors playing Romans, and actors of various nationalities and darker complexions playing Hebrews. The strategy works well until the second half, which resorts to pictorial cliches you associate with kitschy religious art and lets its story devolve into a series of clunky set-pieces.\u00a0 Advertisement Joseph Fiennes' Clavius is one of those stalwart leading man types, a morally neutral professional who has a spiritual awakening while doing a dirty job. After overseeing the deaths of several Hebrew prisoners, including the revolutionary Yeshua (Jesus of Nazareth), he finds himself assigned by Pontius Pilate (Peter Firth) to guard the cave where the supposed messiah's remains are being stored. The two exhausted soldiers he assigns to the task get drunk and fall asleep, and the next morning the remains are gone. This is a PR nightmare for the Romans. Throughout the land there's talk of a miraculous return, and although Pilate and his underlings seem properly spooked by the prospect, at first they treat it mainly as a management problem: the emperor is set to visit soon, and when he arrives the territory needs to be firmly under Roman control, not battling insurgents energized by news that Yeshua is still out there.  And so Clavius has to act like a detective, questioning people who knew Yeshua or were in His presence during His final days, in hopes of figuring out what happened to the body. It couldn't be an instance of the Son of God coming back from the dead, after all, because that would be a miracle! During his travels, Clavius hears one witness after another describe Yeshua\u2014who is, of course, played by Cliff Curtis, modern American cinema's all-purpose ethnic\u2014as a benevolent prophet with supernatural powers. And he starts to wonder if he's on the wrong side.  Fiennes' performance sells the transformation. With his attentive stare and subtle reactions\u2014by turns mortified, judgmental and cynically exhausted\u2014he makes Clavius seem more attentive and skeptical than his countrymen. When the tale begins, the character already seems aware that Roman dominance of the region can't be sustained. All this business with the messiah and the cave jump-starts a spiritual crisis that builds within him. Fiennes' expressions are just right. We see the character being rattled by other peoples' astonishment and gradually deciding to give in and join it.  Advertisement You know where this story has to end up, but to its credit, \"Risen\" takes a slightly unconventional route to get there. Reynolds and Aiello's script keeps much of the first half's action earthbound, letting other characters describe miracles rather than trying to visualize them for us, and bringing the land and culture to life in blunt ways.\u00a0 The direction frames simple gestures that would be tossed-off in other Bible pictures, such as tearing a loaf of bread or sipping a jug of wine, in loving close-ups, amplifying the ritual aspect and reminding us that every bit of food and drink is important.\u00a0Life is cheap here. The most persistent sound is the buzzing of flies over putrefying corpses. When Clavius must decide during the mass crucifixion whether to direct a soldier to break a prisoner's legs or pierce his torso with a spear, he's as coldly analytical as a golfer deciding which club to use. The film's opening battle, which sees Clavius leading infantrymen against a band of Hebrew guerrilla fighters, pays careful attention to tactics. At one point, Clavius' men take the Hebrews' high ground away from them by sending infantry to the rock shelf where the enemy has gathered and having them crouch down and place their shields on their backs in a mosaic pattern, like over-sized floor tiles, so that their fellow soldiers can use them as a living ramp.\u00a0 Although the filmmaking in \"Risen\" isn't at the same high level as that of \"The Gospel According to St. Matthew,\" \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" and \"The Passion of the Christ,\" it's on the same creative wavelength. We're not hearing a genteel sermon delivered from the pulpit of in an air-conditioned megachurch, but the harsher phrasing of a street preacher. You get a sense of Roman-dominated Jerusalem as an actual place, an occupied territory that could slip from the master's grasp if two or three things go wrong for them. Rome's eventual doom is foretold the instant that Pilate dismisses the Hebrew\r\n faith with a condescending sentence fragment: \"'No other gods,' and so \r\non.\" Although the film is mostly solemn, there are welcome flashes of humor. When Clavius asks a barracks full of soldiers if anybody knows Mary Magdalene (Maria Botto), every other hand shoots up.  Of course, Yeshua does return (after 2000+ years, there's no need for a spoiler alert) and spends quality time with His disciples, but they never know when He'll show up or when He'll leave, so they just have to accept it this as the price of being in His presence. \"Is he coming back?\" Clavius asks a disciple. \"How would I know?\" the man replies. Curtis can't quite get a handle on the character, which tends to happen when actors are asked to give life to holy abstractions. He beams like a contented surfer, his kinky locks half-obscuring his brown eyes, and hugs people, and strolls along the shore yelling instructions to disciples in a boat.  There's so much thoughtful acting, directing and writing in \"Risen\" that it's a shame the film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself. Yeshua's farewell appearance is a bunch of mass-market religious art cliches, with the film's only terrible CGI, and the story seems to just sort of stop rather than end, as if it ran out of things to say. It keeps threatening to be miraculous and never gets there. But there's some rough magic in it. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Sand Castle", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Fernando Coimbra\u2019s \u201cSand Castle\u201d offers too little to the War is Hell genre to be noteworthy. It\u2019s a true story, and so that has some inherent value, and the young cast is relatively strong, especially a few stand-outs, but we\u2019ve seen too many similar stories in the decade-and-a-half since 9/11 for this one to register as anything special. On a production level, it\u2019s surprisingly flat, as if its story was strong enough to overcome a lack of visual language. Sadly, it\u2019s just not. The most interesting thing about \u201cSand Castle\u201d is when it takes place. Its protagonist, Private Matt Ocre (Nicholas Hoult) enlisted in the reserves to help pay for college \u2026 in July 2001. Of course, two months later, the world changed. The film opens with an Ocre so desperate to get out of combat that he slams his hand in a car door. It doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s quickly dispatched to Baghdad, where we meet this film\u2019s cast of military characters, led by the tough but rational Sgt. Harper (Logan Marshall-Green).  Advertisement Three months after an intense firefight that ends with an Apache helicopter producing American-brand devastation, Ocre and his team are sent to a small town called Baqubah. They\u2019re there to fix a water pumping station so the local villagers don\u2019t die of thirst. Of course, the station needs fixing because the U.S. forces bombed it. And, of course, some of the locals don\u2019t want the American soldiers anywhere near them. And so an interesting dynamic develops, one in which \u201cSand Castle\u201d becomes something of an allegory for U.S. foreign policy\u2014cleaning up a mess we made\u2014and one that reflects how those Oorah days after 9/11 (in which it felt, at least to some, that the United States was going to help save the Middle East) soon fell into quicksand. Ocre is increasingly aware of the futility of their very presence in Baqubah. When someone says in the final act, after a brutal loss of life, \u201cWell, a rough night, but it\u2019s not for nothing,\u201d it\u2019s tempting to disagree about the last part. The young cast of \u201cSand Castle\u201d delivers a mixed bag of performances. Hoult is one of those actors who needs a strong director to bring out his best work and Coimbra doesn\u2019t seem able to do that. He\u2019s too flat and uninteresting as a protagonist. His most interesting scene is his first, when he slams his hand in the Humvee door. After that, we don\u2019t really get to know him the way we need to. Far more interesting is Marshall-Green as the more resilient and experienced soldier. He\u2019s a very intriguing young actor who I hope to see more of soon. As for Henry Cavill, first surprising in a buzz cut and beard, he barely makes an impact, which has kind of become his norm. Better in the supporting cast are a slightly unhinged Glen Powell (\"Everybody Wants Some!!\") and a practical Parker Sawyers (\u201cSouthside with You\u201d). Ultimately, the biggest problems with \u201cSand Castle\u201d are familiarity and form (or lack thereof). As for the first, we\u2019ve seen this story before, at least a dozen times. Sure, the particulars are different, but the futility of war, especially in the 21st century, has been well documented. And there\u2019s just not enough new to this variation to justify the lack of character development and visual flair. It\u2019s too routine in nearly every way. Sure, there\u2019s a performance here or there, and a conversation-worthy topic about how wartime was different in 2003 than today, but neither of those are nearly enough to carry a film that\u2019s the last thing a war movie can possibly be: boring.

{"Title": "Porto", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cPorto,\u201d a film about the emotional aftermath of a powerful one-night stand, is a poetically assembled tale of lust, obsession and nostalgia. It aims (maybe too obviously) to be a modern version of one of those mid-twentieth century European Art Cinema classics in which beautiful people with beautiful clothes sit in beautiful restaurants and bars and occasionally have beautiful sex and then talk about literature and philosophy. It\u2019s also a film whose impact derives from something other than its story and characters\u2014specifically, Wyatt Garfield\u2019s brilliant cinematography, which uses 35mm, 16mm and Super 8mm film at a time when almost everyone in the entertainment business is shooting digitally; and the final lead performance by Anton Yelchin, who died last year in a freak accident. Advertisement The appearance onscreen of pointillist swarms of film grain may trigger a specific kind of nostalgia in movie buffs, for chemically produced and mechanically projected images that are rarely seen these days outside of repertory cinemas and museums. The viewer\u2019s swooning regard for Garfield\u2019s old-fashioned photographic imagery could merge with their affection for Yelchin, a versatile and likable actor who died just when he was getting warmed up. This is the kind of grade inflation that nobody involved in the production could have wanted, but \u201cPorto\u201d will benefit from it nonetheless. As directed by Gabe Klinger and cowritten by Larry Gross (\"48 Hours\"), it\u2019s less than meets the eye and ear. It\u2019s dramatically thin and confusingly edited in places, and there are basic problems in the lovers\u2019 characterizations that are never convincingly addressed. Mati (Lucie Lucas), a stunning beauty with long, dark hair and a teasing French New Wave smirk, is too much of an intellectual filmmaker\u2019s sex fantasy. The movie stares into her face and lingers on her body in lieu of giving her a comprehensible psychology. She\u2019s more of a Woman-as-Mystery type, which is something else that the movie borrows from the heyday of Fellini and Godard. We never get a handle on why she\u2019d practically beg to go home with the hero, or why she\u2019d respond in kind when Jake impulsively tells her he loves her, or why she\u2019d continue to speak to him after they tussle in the street and he slaps her, or why she\u2019d want to see Jake years later when he barges back into her life. Jake feels more like a real person than Mati, but his realness poses a different set of problems. With his ashy skin, receding hairline, poor posture and birdlike movements, there\u2019s nothing to suggest why a fashion magazine-ready knockout like Mati would select him on the spot, much less why he\u2019d sexually satisfy her so profoundly, or why she\u2019d eventually end up marrying another guy (Paulo Calatre ) and having his baby, or who she is, generally. There\u2019s a lot in \u201cPorto\u201d that you have to take on faith, or for granted. This contrasts the movie unflatteringly with works that it clearly adores, such as \u201cHiroshima, Mon Amour,\u201d a film that doles out information sparingly yet leaves you feeling as if you know its lovers as well as you know anyone in your own life.\u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement The film\u2019s clever editing (credited to Klinger and Geraldine Mangenot) jumps through time in intriguing, sometimes intoxicating ways, and even when the drama flags there\u2019s always a stunning image to stare at, be it a wide shot of a buzzing city thoroughfare, a close-up of a woman\u2019s hand twirling a red lipstick tube near a steaming cup of tea, or a long shot of Mati crossing a widescreen frame from left to right, her red and white umbrella glowing against the overcast sky and grey-and-eggshell buildings. Klinger and Wyatt are such connoisseurs of light falling on stone, wood floors, fabric, and skin that I might\u2019ve liked \u201cPorto\u201d just as well had it consisted of nothing more than silent shots of Lucas and Yelchin walking, talking, lounging in bed and staring at each other in cafes. Whether you consider that description a warning or an enticement will depend on what you want from a film like \u201cPorto.\u201d", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Hellion", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "At different points through Kat Candler's devastating feature \"Hellion,\" the young Wilson brothers\u201410-year-old Wes (Deke Garner) and 13-year-old Jacob (Josh Higgins)\u2014are seen reading \"Swiss Family Robinson,\" a story about a family shipwrecked in the East Indies, who create a new home for themselves on a deserted island. Without driving the point home sledgehammer-style, the presence of \"Swiss Family Robinson\" is a reminder that what we are seeing in \"Hellion\" is also a shipwrecked family\u2014shipwrecked by loss, alcoholism, poverty, and neglect. One of \"Hellion\"'s major strengths is that it shows how quickly things can spin out of control, how one or two defining events can derail a life forever. Told with much sentiment and almost no sentimentality, \"Hellion\" is a well-observed and patiently told story, with one good scene after another, featuring amazing performances across the board, but particularly from newcomer Josh Wiggins. Advertisement The Wilson family consists of dad Hollis (\"Breaking Bad\"'s Aaron Paul, in yet another remarkable performance) and the two aforementioned sons. The mother has died, leaving behind an abyss in her wake, as well as her fragile dream that re-locating to Galveston will somehow give the family a fresh start. Hollis continues to invest in his dead wife's dream, driving the 40 miles to Galveston to work on their wrecked house (already in foreclosure). In the meantime, his two sons rage free, completely unmonitored. It's not that Hollis doesn't love his sons. He does. But his own grief and loss, not to mention alcoholism, has made him incapable of caring for them or himself. 13-year-old Jacob is first seen trashing a pickup truck outside a football stadium with his group of buddies he calls \"the crew\". Metallica and Slayer and other heavy metal monsters grind through the soundtrack, providing a violent, driving subtext to the often-melancholy scenes. Jacob is basically in charge of his younger brother, and he takes that as seriously as a 13-year-old boy can take it. But he is too young to be a caretaker; he favors Wonder Bread with whipped cream and sugar for lunch, and he has already been placed in a juvenile detention program, threatened with being locked up for the rest of his adolescence if he doesn't get his act together. Worryingly, Jacob starts to involve Wes in the criminal nighttime outings of \"the crew\". Hollis, taken up with his own pain, and perhaps residual guilt about descending into a drunken stupor following his wife's death, is seemingly unaware of just how bad things have gotten. His house is a total mess. Beer cans pile up on the counter. He gives Jacob a talking-to about \"the crew,\" but still disappears for days at a time, leaving the boys unattended. His dead wife's sister, Pam (Juliette Lewis), is concerned. She tries to talk to Jacob, but there is little she can actually do. \"Hellion\" covers familiar ground, but it feels fresh. The film doesn't propose solutions, and it doesn't soft-pedal the fact that Hollis is dropping the ball on his responsibilities. Part of the freshness has to do with the acting, particularly of young Josh Wiggins. He is the center of the film, and he gives a full-blown, beautifully intricate and wrenching performance, completely confident in all of its aspects, not showing any whiff of amateurism. He is tender, thoughtful, pissed off, wild, and completely not dealing with how much he misses his mother. He doesn't seem like a \"child actor.\" Or an actor at all. You wonder, \"Where on earth did they find this boy?\" There is a painful confrontation scene between Jacob and his father at a crowded pizza joint that is pierced through with such agony on the part of Wiggins that all you want to do is race in and save him. And when CPS shows up to take Wes out of the house, the scene that follows is terrible to witness, both children screaming and writhing around in the arms of the police officers, fighting to stay together. It's extraordinary. Advertisement The friends who make up \"the crew\" are also insightful little character studies, a \"Stand By Me\" dynamic with heavy metal T-shirts and Motocross tracks. The boys all have problems at home. Adults aren't really paying attention to them. They all seem extremely vulnerable in regard to what life will have to offer them. Southeast Texas is filmed with haunting specificity by Brett Pawlak, who also shot the moving film \"Short Term 12\" (which takes place in a group home for kids stuck in the foster care system). Pawlak manages to make the Texas landscape look both isolated and hopeless as well as beautiful and dreamy: the towers of a nearby electrical plant looming above a local baseball field, the windswept houses-on-stilts lining the shore in Galveston, the lonely oil drills in the middle of a field. Jacob is often followed around by the camera, from room to room, or from inside to outside, his fragile small head facing out to the hostile, incomprehensible, wider world. A climactic moment in the final section of the film is handled awkwardly and ends up seeming manipulative, an imposed way to twist the screws in with finality. Suddenly, with that moment, the film becomes plot-driven, as opposed to character-driven, and it's a flaw. But, by that time, the real work of the film has already been done. The investment in the characters was so total that I found myself worrying afterwards, obsessively, \"What is going to happen to those boys? Will they be okay? Is everything going to be okay?\" Probably not. But the film makes you hope, against all the evidence, that it will be.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "xXx: Return of Xander Cage", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "How excited ought one get about a sequel in an action franchise that never got off the ground, featuring the return of the leading man whose refusal to appear in the second installment was part of why the franchise never got off the ground, that finally sees theatrical release almost a decade after the intention to produce it was announced? I suppose it depends. Speaking strictly for myself, Vin Diesel, here coming back to play Xander Cage, the James Bond of skateboarding character he originated in 2002\u2019s \u201cXXX\u201d is the least exciting component of this 3D slam-bang fest.  Advertisement The movie opens with Samuel L. Jackson as the outr\u00e9 spymaster Augustus Gibbons, sitting at a Chinese restaurant trying to convince real-life soccer sensation Neymar to join the XXX team. A disaster ensues, and stern buttoned-up spymaster Marke (Toni Collette, here probably earning more to merely maintain an erect posture than she usually does when she\u2019s actually being an incredible actor) calls a meeting at an appropriately eerily-lit CIA boardroom. Here is introduced the McGuffin, here referred to as a Pandora\u2019s Box, which is immediately snatched up by a crack team of black-clad perhaps villains who can leap tall buildings in a single bound, that kind of stuff. One of their number is played by Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen, who made a strong impression in another blockbuster, \u201cRogue One,\u201d a little while back. Who can retrieve the deadly thingie? Marke has to track down the presumed-dead Xander Cage, who\u2019s now spending his faked-own-death hours providing satellite television to impoverished Latin American children. (Don\u2019t ask.) The plot, with its multiple double-crosses and \u201cthis group must somehow form a you-know-what\u201d plot beats, could have been written on the back of a cocktail napkin. More thought, but not that much more, was put into the cast of characters, the \u201crebels\u201d that embody the triple-X ethos (which is a thing\u2014remember that, absent Vin Diesel, there was a 2005 sequel, starring Ice Cube, subtitled \u201cState of the Union,\u201d in 2005). These include a more than fair number of women, which is commendable in theory. Less commendable in practice is that maybe a quarter of them are obligated to behave as if they\u2019re dying to fall into bed with Diesel. When Cage goes to London to track down the identities of the interlopers of the eerily-lit boardroom, he spends time sauna-side with an intelligence expert, name of Ainsley, who\u2019s played by Hermoine Caulfield, an actress in her mid twenties who looks about fifteen, and whose bikinied torso is practically drooled upon director of photography Russell Carpenter\u2019s camera. Things get a little less distasteful with the introductions of punky sniper Adele (Ruby Rose) on Xander\u2019s team and fast draw Serena (Deepika Padukone) on the opposite (but not for long). These two are almost enough to make up for Nina Dobrev\u2019s Becky, a geek girl who provides Xander with her \u201csafe word\u201d within minutes if not seconds of their meeting.  Anyway, Xander doesn\u2019t sleep with Ainsley; rather, she provides him access to about six of her girlfriends (in porn this is called a \u201creverse gangbang,\u201d and while what\u2019s depicted is hardly explicit, this is what the audience is meant to believe went on), after which Cage makes an observation on the lengths he goes to for his country that wasn\u2019t particularly funny when it first was heard, in, yes, a James Bond movie.  Vin Diesel is going to be fifty this year. His body is still toned, but facially he\u2019s starting to look like a cross between Harpo Marx and that poor fellow who played the Amazing Colossal Man. In medium close-ups, his head takes up two thirds of the screen. And his line readings haven\u2019t gained added suavity over the years. Forcing his character to be what they used to call catnip to the ladies here is just a lot of leading-man aggrandizement that serves no end for the actual viewer.  Advertisement D.J. Caruso\u2019s direction, for the most part, is second-tier Bayhem, with the camera swerving from a low angle as, say, a truck takes flight and pirouettes above it. However. The last forty minutes of the movie do come together in a pretty diverting way. Xander\u2019s motley crew musters a \u201cOhana means family\u201d vibe familiar to fans of the other franchise Diesel abandoned and then returned to, that \u201cFast and Furious\u201d thing. There\u2019s a bit of \u201cA-Team\u201d zaniness thrown in as well, and this makes the intercut parallel action sequences of the climax\u2014with Xander\u2019s crew on the ground while Diesel and Yen fight out the real bad guys on an intimidating government plane\u2014work pretty well. And Yen, despite being cut away from too quickly, too often, really delivers the martial arts goods. (Diesel\u2019s stunt double is frequently detectable.) There\u2019s also a fun cameo I won\u2019t spoil here, although I\u2019ve seen a trailer that spoils it, but that\u2019s life\u2014it\u2019s still kind of fun. And of course the whole thing ends with a setup for a sequel, which I hope gets to screens before Vin Diesel is about to hit sixty, although seeing him on a skateboard at that age might be pretty diverting.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Voices", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Ryan Reynolds is having a bit of a moment, even if too few\r\npeople are seeing it. Taken together, his work in Atom Egoyan\u2019s \u201cThe Captive,\u201d\r\nAnna Boden & Ryan Fleck\u2019s Sundance hit \u201cMississippi Grind\u201d and, releasing\r\nOn Demand and in limited theatrical release today, Marjane Satrapi\u2019s \u201cThe Voices,\u201d represent a renaissance for the actor, who is clearly taking roles that\r\ninterest him instead of the biggest paychecks or most likely shots at stardom.\r\nI\u2019ve always liked Reynolds for the most part, but he does his best work yet here in\r\nSatrapi\u2019s odd, pitch-black comedy about a man who talks to his dog and cat. And\r\nthey talk back. Advertisement The opening act of \u201cThe Voices\u201d has echoes of Joel and Ethan\r\nCoen\u2019s sarcastic looks at small town life as we meet the relentlessly upbeat\r\nJerry (Reynolds), a worker at a toy factory at which he must dress in pink\r\nevery day. He\u2019s as happy as they come, gleefully planning an office party and\r\nover the moon at the fact that it will include a conga line to \"Sing a Happy Song\" like a cheesy\r\nwedding. It\u2019s only when he returns to his rundown abode that his cat Mr.\r\nWhiskers sets him straight\u2014\u201cThe only\r\nreason they don\u2019t fire your ass is because you\u2019re so hopelessly pathetic you\r\namuse them.\u201d Like so many filmmakers before her, Satrapi is exploring the\r\ndark underbelly and murderous intent of even the most cheerful, seemingly happy\r\npeople in society.  Jerry needs to be on drugs to function normally. So says Dr.\r\nWarren (an underutilized Jacki Weaver), with whom he regularly meets. Without\r\nhis anti-psychotic medication, Jerry talks to his dog Bosco and his cat Mr.\r\nWhiskers (who are both perfectly voiced by Reynolds himself\u2026which makes a\r\ntwisted sense if you think about it). Bosco is the supportive angel to his loyal master\r\nwhile Mr. Whiskers is the devil on Jerry\u2019s shoulder, encouraging bad behavior\r\nand denigrating every attempt at normalcy.  Jerry acts on his romantic interest in a gorgeous co-worker named\r\nFiona (Gemma Arterton), asking her out for Chinese food. After she stands him\r\nup, he happens upon her in the road, offering her a ride home. A car crash\r\nleads to an accidental death, and before you know it Fiona\u2019s head is in Jerry\u2019s\r\nfridge. And it\u2019s still talking to him. Bosco tries to convince Jerry that he\u2019s\r\nstill a good guy but Fiona wants a friend in the lonely refrigerator. Mr.\r\nWhiskers thinks that\u2019s a grand idea. There\u2019s a great sequence about halfway through \u201cThe Voices\u201d\r\nin which Jerry gives in and takes his meds as ordered, waking up to a world\r\nthat he doesn\u2019t want to live in. He has no friends without the voices in his\r\nhead/pets. And the talking head of Fiona in his dementia is much more appealing\r\nthan the reality of a decomposing head in his refrigerator. \u201cThe Voices\u201d is the tale of a man who\r\ncan\u2019t look back, really since the death of his mother, or he\u2019ll really go insane. Once you start talking\r\nto your pets, there\u2019s no turning around. Advertisement And that\u2019s what Reynolds truly captures: the idea that Jerry\r\nis a man forced down a road of violence by things that he cannot control. He is\r\na unique serial killer in that he so wants normalcy, companionship and\r\nhappiness. The joy in Reynolds\u2019 eyes when he is shown human kindness by another\r\nco-worker (the always-great Anna Kendrick) is as key to this performance as the\r\ninsanity that other actors would have focused on and turned into scenery chewing. Reynolds\r\nuses his natural charm and good looks to great effect here. He\u2019s the boy next\r\ndoor; the smiling co-worker who\u2019s both easy to root for and remarkably annoying\r\nin the same breath. It may be hard to believe until you see it but this is a truly\r\nsubtle take on a man who has conversations with his pets. It\u2019s really great\r\nwork.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Tower", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Polish journalist Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski wrote, in regards to the momentous  events taking place throughout Eastern Europe in the spring of 1989: \"Germans say Zeitgeist, the spirit of the times. It  is a fascinating moment, fraught with promise, when this spirit of the  times, dozing pitifully and apathetically, like a huge wet bird on a  branch, suddenly and without a clear reason (or at any rate without a  reason allowing of an entirely rational explanation), unexpectedly takes  off in bold and joyful flight. We all hear the shush  of this flight. It stirs our imagination and gives us energy: we begin  to act.\" Advertisement Set in East Germany during the final decade of Communism, Christian  Schwochow's \"The Tower,\" a German mini-series based on the best-selling  novel by Uwe Tellkamp, is about the lead-up to such a moment of  collective flight. The film ends with the image of a huge flock of birds  erupting up into the sky, wheeling through the free and empty air. When  the end came for the GDR, it came with a whimper, in the form of a  radio broadcast with an official voice announcing to the populace that  there would no longer be any restrictions on border crossings. You're  free to go, basically, was the message. What started as a trickle of  refugees became a vast flood. \"The Tower\" is beautiful to look at,  elegantly filmed, with very good performances across the board. There  are multiple story-lines (too many, really) and a big cast of  intersecting characters (its literary source-material is evident in the  adaptation). At its best, \"The Tower\" shows what life felt like to those  who lived at that singular time, to those who dozed \"pitifully and  apathetically\" in an unchanging political system before the rules  changed, seemingly overnight. Richard Hoffman (Jan Josef Liefers) is a surgeon at a clinic in Dresden,  with burn tissue all over his back, an eternal reminder of the 1945  firebombing of his hometown when he was a child. He is married to a  nurse (Claudia Michelsen), and they have a teenage son named Christian  (Sebastian Urzendowsky). Richard has been carrying on an affair with his  secretary that has resulted in a child, now 5 years old. Hoffman goes  back and forth between the two homes, and his wife supposedly knows  nothing about the second family, although you can see her give him a  couple of sharp glances on occasion. The mistress wants Hoffman to get a  divorce. Hoffman, due to professional and personal reasons, knows that  is impossible. In the meantime, he is on autopilot with his own  duplicity. The forms of Communist rule are still in place, and yet are greeted with  eye-rolls by nearly everyone. The forms have become empty, symbols one  must kow-tow to, but are ultimately meaningless. It is a world dominated by  propaganda and censorship, where \"thoughtcrimes\" (to quote Orwell, as  the characters in \"The Tower\" often do) are punishable offenses, where  the Stasi are still a terrorizing force. Socialism, ironically, created a  strict caste system (one privileged person jokes, \"No privileges.  Wasn't that the message once?\"), and the Hoffman family in \"The Tower\"  would be considered \"bourgeois\"; a pampered elite group, doctors and  book-publishers and musicians. Their private lives are as chaotic as  their public lives are appropriate. In such a political system, lying is  a necessary skill. Advertisement We meet other characters in the Hoffman social circle, including Meno (G\u00f6tz  Schubert), a book publisher who works with authors on removing  potentially problematic passages in their novels. He loves literature,  and he has been forced to become a censor. It is despicable work and  exacts a psychological toll on Meno (Schubert is phenomenal in the role)  especially when he is assigned to work with an author (Valery  Tscheplanowa) who refuses to edit her novel about the Red Army's rape of  German women upon invading the country. \"It happened,\" she says. The  publisher's reply comes back: \"The question is what good does it do to  write about it.\" She is thrown out of the Writer's Union because of her  refusal, placing her beyond the pale, in exile in her own country, all  publishing doors closed to her. Meno is haunted by her, keeps trying to  reach out, right that wrong. There are colleagues of Hoffman's at the clinic, one of whom collects  vintage cars, but who also is secretly building an airplane in his  garage to take his wife and daughter across the border. Hoffman's  mistress, played by Nadja Uhl (so excellent in \"The Baeder Meinhof  Complex,\" and excellent here too), is desperate for her lover's  protection and attention, and becomes a liability when he turns his back  on her and their daughter. These are private matters, and yet they get  the attention of the Stasi, who can use it to blackmail Hoffman.\u00a0 Schwochow keeps these plot-lines moving smoothly and briskly, filming it  all in a cold green-tinted palette, suggesting the deprivations and  stagnancy of the world behind the Iron Curtain. There are no primary  colors. This is a landscape underwater. The film is strongest when it  shows the direct connection between State control and private life. This  is most clearly shown in Meno's relationship with the censored author,  and in Christian's increasing trouble with authority. Christian's  schoolwork is propaganda, and school papers are graded according to  whether or not they express the proper \"class attitudes.\" Christian  starts getting in trouble for reading non-approved books, and his  parents flip out. He was raised in an intellectual household, and yet in  public he is meant to toe the party line. His parents encourage him to  live the same duplicitous life that they do, and he stops being able to  comply. The transformation of Christian from a gawky sweet teenager to  tough-minded grim veteran of multiple authoritative organizations  (school, military, prison) is heartbreaking. Advertisement \"The Tower\" loses focus with some of the characters, becoming generic, a  soap opera we've seen before. Hoffman's situation with his secret  mistress and his wife could happen in any country, any time, and the  film slackens in these sequences. When the story goes back to Meno and  Chrsitian, it tightens up again, finding its underlying architecture, the  themes that are the film's engine. Yes, there is danger in Hoffman's  personal situation, but it's personal, and the danger is not as palpable  as the danger Meno faces when he tries to smuggle the author's banned  manuscript out of the country to more welcoming publishers in the West.  Meno goes from a laughing, confident man to a ruined shell of  an individual, and it drives the tragic point home about what politics have done  to talented minds like Meno's. Schwochow, who grew up in East Germany, has a wonderful subtle touch in  portraying the small details of everyday life. Meno and Christian sit in  an empty field in the middle of nowhere, watching television in the one  spot where they can pick up the signals from the TV tower in West  Germany. It's like messages arriving from a distant planet. In one  scene, Hoffman and his wife take a walk through the streets of Dresden  at night, and the power goes out (a common occurrence). Neighbors call  out to one another, joking about \"the reality of socialism\", and then  someone puts a record on an old crank-up victrola, scratchy music  floating out of the house. Hoffman and his wife dance slowly in the  street, holding on to one another. It's a beautiful scene, containing all  the complexity and irony and challenges of the political and personal  moment. In one of the dinner party scenes at the Hoffman house, everyone  shares about how difficult it is to praise Socialism at public events.  One woman says she \"thinks of something beautiful\" when she has to say  the word \"Socialism\" and so they go around the table, jokingly listing  movie stars they will think about the next time they have to say the  word. \"Brigitte Bardot.\" \"Brooke Shields.\" \"Alain Delon.\" \"The Tower\" is  full of such darkly humorous and intelligently observed moments. As the film veers into 1988, the scenes get shorter, the pace more  relentless, hopping from one person's arc to the next and then back,  Schwochow giving a palpable sense that time, after having been stopped  for almost half a century, is speeding up. The final half-hour of the  film is thrilling, individuals confronting the crack-up of the State in  their own individual ways; the groundswell of freedom and liberty  destabilizing the entire atmosphere. Characters look at one another with  an open sense of awe and fear in their faces, as if to say: \"Is this  really happening? Is this real?\" \"The Tower\" is too long, and could do with some serious trimming, but in  general it is a powerful and engrossing look at the moment in history  when the tide started turning; when the people reared up out of their  apathy; when the \"spirit of the times\" became an irresistible flood.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}

{"Title": "Midnight Special", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "How far would you go to protect your child? What if saving\r\nhim meant letting him go? Jeff Nichols\u2019 brilliant \u201cMidnight Special\u201d weaves\r\nrelatable themes of parental responsibility and faith in that which is traditionally unexplainable into a sci-fi road movie, with echoes of John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, and Stephen King bouncing throughout. So many modern blockbusters err on the side of hand-holding,\r\nunderlining their plots and character motivations with consistent expository\r\ndialogue or overly defined narration. There\u2019s this bizarre concern by Hollywood\r\nthat audiences will rebel if they don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s going on at every\r\ngiven moment, and so characters talk to themselves, motivations are spelled out\r\nin voiceover, and everyone, especially in action movies, speaks of what they\r\nhave to do and why they have to do it. \u201cMidnight Special\u201d respects your intelligence, letting you come to its themes emotionally instead of narratively. It is a breathtaking\r\ndisplay of visual storytelling, confidently rendered by someone who understands\r\nthe power of cinema. Advertisement Nichols, who also wrote the film, plunges us into the action\r\nof the piece immediately. Two men\u2014Roy (Michael Shannon, who has appeared in\r\nevery Nichols film) and Lucas (Joel Edgerton)\u2014are in a motel room, watching a\r\nnews story about a manhunt involving a kidnapped boy. The boy is in between the\r\ntwo beds in the room, reading comic books with a flashlight. His name is Alton\r\n(Jaeden Lieberher), and he\u2019s special. He\u2019s so special that an entire religious\r\nsect has sprouted up around him, led by Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard). As Roy and\r\nLucas flee into the night with Alton in the backseat and wearing night vision goggles\r\nso they can turn off their headlights to make themselves harder to spot, Calvin\u2019s\r\ncompound is raided. It turns out everyone is looking for Alton. The FBI brings in a specialist to meet with Calvin\u2019s flock\r\nnamed Paul Sevier (Adam Driver), trying to figure what they know about the boy\r\nand exactly what this golden child means to them. It turns out that the cult of Alton\r\nworships numeric sequences that the potential prophet has been revealing to them. It also\r\nturns out that these numeric sequences mean something to the government, and\r\nthey want to know how a child knew them. Finally, the numbers seem to be pointing\r\nAlton, Roy and Lucas to a specific location. Lucas is one of the recently converted\u2014through a special power that Alton has to convey something transcendent through beams that shoot from his eye\u2014but Roy's devotion is purely parental. Both men need\u00a0to get Alton\u00a0there in\r\ntime; nothing will stop them. The drive of Roy, Alton\u2019s father, is made clear in an early\r\nscene in which the trio encounters a state trooper. He sees their license plate\r\nand looks like he\u2019s about to call it in when Roy and Lucas draw on him. Is\r\ntheir mission important enough to kill a cop? Roy\u2019s drive to do what he\r\nthinks he needs to be done for his son is motivated by the passion of fatherhood,\r\nbut is Lucas\u2019 purpose as committed? And how will Alton\u2019s mother, played by Kirsten\r\nDunst, respond? \u201cMidnight Special\u201d is masterful in the way it keeps answering\r\nquestions and then asking new ones, always staying one step ahead of the\r\nviewer. It\u2019s a testament to Nichols\u2019 direction that we trust that we are in the\r\nhands of a master, willing to take the journey wherever it may lead us.  Advertisement And the final destination for that journey, while I would\r\nnever spoil it, is surprisingly emotionally resonant. Alton being \u201cspecial\u201d could easily be read as an allegory for a sick child, one who is not like\r\nthe others and needs a different kind of care and attention; one who is special\r\nin a way that only parents who have dealt with that kind of pain and loss could\r\nunderstand. There is also an undeniable story of faith buried in \u201cMidnight\r\nSpecial\u201d\u2014about believing in something unseen, something greater than ourselves.\r\nMuch of this emotional undercurrent falls on the shoulders of Nichols\u2019 cast,\r\nespecially the driven, subtle performance from Michael Shannon, although he\u2019s\r\nmatched by great work from Dunst, Edgerton, Driver, and the rest of the cast.  \u201cMidnight Special\u201d also relies on essential contributions from cinematographer Adam Stone (who has worked with Nichols on all of his films) and composer David Wingo. Stone captures the natural world almost as another character (as he did in \u201cTake Shelter\u201d and \u201cMud\u201d) and makes a work of art out of a sequence that hinges on a sunrise. Nichols and Stone's compositions are completed by Wingo\u2019s score, which often drives us to the film\u2019s emotions as it goes daringly dialogue-free for large chunks of the action. In the end, that\u2019s what I take away from \u201cMidnight Special\u201d\u2014the\r\npower of visual storytelling. It is images from the film that pass through my\r\nmind most\u2014flames falling from the sky, a father carrying his child, the shaking of\r\ngrass as something is about to happen, and the jaw-dropping finale. Nichols is\r\nthe rare filmmaker who understands that this is what we take away from the best\r\nfilms, and the powerful way that art reflects that which transcends words: a father's dedication, the pain of a sick child, belief in something greater than ourselves. Sure, we quote our favorite lines and do impressions of characters, but\r\nit is the pictures that haunt us, that linger in our mind, and that stay with\r\nus. Sometimes forever.

{"Title": "Before I Wake", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Mike Flanagan has become an in-house horror factory for Netflix, and built quite a following in the process. Netflix Originals \u201cHush\u201d and \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d earned the talented filmmaker such cultural cachet that he parlayed their success into an original series for the service, \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House,\u201d currently in production. As if to further bolster what seems like it could become its own channel on the service before long, Netflix has unearthed the long-delayed third film by the director of \u201cOculus\u201d and \u201cOuija: Origin of Evil,\u201d \u201cBefore I Wake,\u201d which was originally scheduled to be released in 2015 and already premiered in most international markets. The film was delayed a few times after its 2014 production and then fell into release limbo after Relativity Media went out of business. When this happens, the eventual release is often a letdown. Put simply, films often gather dust when left on a shelf, and sometimes they\u2019ve been left there for reasons other than financial. But this is not the case with \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d\u2014well, not completely. It\u2019s a flawed film, but there are elements that really work, especially the lead performance and some of Flanagan\u2019s gifts with composition. \"Before\u00a0I Wake\"\u00a0is also particularly interesting to watch now as one can see it as a career stepping stone to the movies he's made since. Advertisement The release of \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d revealed that Flanagan had long been carrying around the Stephen King book on which that film was based as it was his dream project. Were \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d to be released when it should have been, it would have been easy to see even then that Flanagan was a fan of King\u2019s style. This unfolds a lot like a King short story with its focus on grief and lessons about being careful what you wish for. Clearly inspired by the author,\u00a0\u201cBefore I Wake\u201d is evidence of a young horror voice working through ideas that one would have called promising three years ago\u2014a promise Flanagan has\u00a0already fulfilled for most. He\u2019s a filmmaker interested in human emotions and reactions more than he is things that go bump in the night.    \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d opens with a scene reminiscent of the opening of Joachim Trier\u2019s \u201cThelma.\u201d A man (Dash Mihok)\u00a0nervously watches a boy sleeping. The man pulls a gun on the child, clearly terrified. What would make a man almost kill a young boy? He can\u2019t do it, and we cut to the boy being adopted by Mark and Jessie Hobson (Thomas Jane & Kate Bosworth), a couple who we learn has not long ago lost their own son in a tragic drowning. The boy is named Cody (Jacob Tremblay, who shot this before his breakthrough in \u201cRoom\u201d), and he\u2019s, well, special.    After Cody has gone to sleep one night, Mark and Jessie see brightly colored butterflies around their living room. Mark goes to capture one, only to have it disappear as Cody wakes. Yes, Cody can manifest his dreams. Rather than turn this into a pure boogeyman tale, Flanagan channels the grief of parents who have lost a child through his concept when Cody \u201cmanifests\u201d Mark and Jessie\u2019s dead son. What if someone could give you one more chance to see, touch, and even hear someone you\u2019ve lost? Of course, it comes with a hitch\u2014kids have nightmares too, and Cody\u2019s are of a monstrous creation he calls \u201cThe Canker Man.\u201d    Advertisement Flanagan cleverly weaves his emotional themes through his horror story, embodied in lines like \u201cSometimes scary things go away when we understand them a little,\u201d one that has heightened meaning when one considers the story when the origin of \u201cThe Canker Man\u201d has been revealed. It\u2019s things like this\u2014the way Flanagan refuses to merely tell a jump scare story\u2014that elevate his work. And he\u2019s phenomenal with actors, drawing a great performance from Carla Gugino in \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d and the underrated Kate Bosworth here, who\u2019s fantastic at conveying a hard-to-imagine blend of grief, anxiety, fear, and hope. Flanagan loves close-ups, and he directs his actors well within them. He\u2019s equally deft at the reveal shots we come to expect from horror such as a figure in a doorway in the background in the middle of the night. When \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d gets to the jump scare portions in the mid-section of the movie, especially in a misguided bully subplot, that's\u00a0when it falters, almost as if Flanagan is way less interested in boogeymen than he is the face of a grieving mother.    \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d culminates in a sequence almost out of \u201cA Nightmare on Elm Street\u201d in its dreamscape visuals and one is reminded of Flanagan\u2019s skill with framing (and he uses a great score by\u00a0Danny Elfman effectively), but also that not everything is coming together here thematically or narratively. Like the butterflies that flit across the frame throughout the movie, the various pieces of \u201cBefore I Wake\u201d are individually beautiful but don\u2019t quite cohere into a complete vision in the end. While there's more to like here than in half the horror offerings on Netflix, \"Before I Wake\"\u00a0needed one more pass in the writing or editing process, or needed to be done later in Flanagan\u2019s career when he could more confidently stick the landing. Given his rise to fame in the few years this has been on the shelf, maybe Netflix will let their horror all-star remake it someday.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Cheap Thrills", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Cheap Thrills\" is a movie that Rod Serling would have loved. Driven by a stellar everyman performance by the always-great Pat Healy, E.L. Katz's darkly comic thriller plays that oh-so-common \"Twilight Zone\" game of putting an average protagonist in an extreme situation and asking the viewer to wonder what they would do in his shoes. It's a smart, fun, twisted little festival hit which has already garnered quite a vocal fan base through On Demand viewing. I wish the final act was a bit darker and that it took the black comedy tone of the first half of the film and turned it into something more of the horror genre, but this is a solid thrill ride all around, especially for those who like their Faustian parables with a bit of the bloody red stuff.  Advertisement Craig (Healy) is in one of life's deeper valleys. He's just been fired, about to be evicted, and has a young child. One fateful night, he runs into an old friend at a bar. He hasn't seen Vince (Ethan Embry) in a half-decade and while Craig has settled down, his old acquaintance seems a bit more instinctive, careless, and potentially violent. The \"odd couple\" dynamic between the two will matter greatly to their journey this fateful night.  Craig and Vince aren't alone in this dive bar. The gregarious Colin (David Koechner) and mopey Violet (Sara Paxton) invite them over for a drink. After noting that they're splitting hundred dollar bills based on exactly how a bar patron sexualizes his drink pourer, the games begin. Colin throws out that he'll pay $50 to the first guy to do the shot in front of them. Vince doesn't think twice, slamming it down. It's just the beginning. You see, it's Violet's birthday and this is how rich sociopaths have fun: playing off the desperation of those with only a fraction of their cash flow. $200 to get the girl at the bar to slap you. $500 to hit a bouncer. Of course, the stakes and the payouts increase after the quartet ends up at Colin's house and the sharp instruments come out.  The main element that separates \"Cheap Thrills\" from similar tales of how far we're willing to go to provide for our families is the brilliant move on the part of screenwriters Trent Haaga and David Chirchirillo to give Craig competition other than his own conscience. Men behave differently when they think someone else, especially an old acquaintance who they like to think they have out-achieved in life, may take what's theirs. It's not just turning down the money Colin is offering but realizing that doing so means it could go to the guy standing next to you. And so there's often little time to think about the consequences. It's not just \"Will you do this?\" It's \"Will you do this before someone else takes away your chance to do so?\" It adds a layer of social commentary and gives the entire film adrenaline as if the next challenge could be accepted before either man has had a chance to even think about it. The difference in social type between Craig and Vince adds a fresh dynamic as well. Vince has a violent streak and Craig has a desperate one. Which will be their undoing?  It helps to have a natural performer like Healy in the lead role. He never oversells Craig's desperation, allowing it to clearly influence his actions but never steal focus. Embry is solid throughout but Koechner threatens to steal the piece in its showiest role. He's never been better, turning up the volume on that streak of malevolence that he often brings to even comedic parts like his character in the \"Anchorman\" films. Koechner has always seemed a bit off and he uses that amply here. At his best, he seems honestly dangerous and yet remains friendly enough to believe that our heroes would stay in his spider's web.  Advertisement I wish there was a bit more follow through on those hints of honest danger. \"Cheap Thrills\" takes a very dark turn at about the 50 minute that I won't spoil and I thought to myself how are Katz and his writers going to work their way out of this one? They do so a little too neatly for my tastes, kind of winking at the audience as things get truly crazy instead of just allowing the comedy-thriller to naturally become more of the latter. It's a minor complaint for a very enjoyable cautionary tale about the perils of doing anything for a buck. Serling would be proud.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Gods of Egypt", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "They don't make movies like \"Gods of Egypt\" anymore, and yet they never made movies like \"Gods of Egypt.\" This is the paradox, and for a while, it's a fun one. But after a point, this proudly silly film about gods and mortals in ancient Egypt devolves into an sword-and-sorcery-flavored riff on a weak Marvel movie. The alternately cornball and self-aware dialogue and the clearly not state-of-the-art CGI would seeming charmingly retro (like something from a TV miniseries two decades ago) if the movie didn't trot out one epic action film cliche after another.\u00a0 Advertisement Gerard Butler stars as Set, god of disorder. He wrests control of his kingdom from his brother, Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) in an opening hand-to-hand combat sequence where the siblings clang swords and beat on each other for a while, until they both assume the form of armored creatures that look like Marvel-movie android warriors and leap through the air, knocking each other against pillars until Set finally tears Horus's eyes out. (Why the combatants don't assume super-powerful form to start with is one of those questions that films like this never answer.)  At first, Set wants to kill Horus outright, but relents when the goddess Hathor (Elodie Yung) begs him to be merciful. Set banishes the blind Horus to a crypt where he's eventually set free by the intrepid mortal Bek (Brenton Thwaites), a resourceful thief whose beautiful young lover, Zaya (Courtney Eaton of \"Mad Max: Fury Road\"), died from an arrow wound and is now trekking through the underworld en route to her final judgment. According to lore, only the king of Egypt can free a dead person from the between-state and return them to the land of the living. That means Horus has only a few days to wrest control of the kingdom from Set. If he doesn't, Bek's girlfriend will stay dead forever.  That's a pretty good setup for an action-adventure: a coup on a timetable. The director, Alex Proyas (\"The Crow,\" \"Dark City\"), seems sure of what sort of film he wants to make. Despite the ostentatiously virtual images and the comic book and borderline science-fiction touches, in its heart \"Gods of Egypt\" is an adventure in what used to be called the \"swords and sandals\" genre. Every brawny chest is waxed, every bosom heaving. The characters address\r\n crowds of thousands of (digital, alas) extras, and run their enemies \r\nthrough with swords and spears and zap them with death rays (hey, some \r\nof them are gods, okay?), and swear fealty to this and vengeance against\r\n that, and tromp around in metal tunics while saying things like, \"Why \r\nwas I made to walk on burning sands while my brother strolled barefoot \r\nalone on the shores of the Nile?\" and \"Give me my eyes!\" and \"Were you \r\nusing my house for your fornicating?\"  Advertisement It's stocked mainly with super-fit actors, few of whom are likely in the ballpark of what actual ancient Egyptians looked like, unless Egypt was populated mainly by white folks with gym-sculpted bods. Proyas sort-of-apologized last year for the casting, saying he would've hired more actors of color if it hadn't made the movie so hard to finance at the budget level he needed. As is, the most prominent nonwhite actor is Chadwick Boseman as a faintly bitchy incarnation of Thoth, the father of science, religion, philosophy and magic. Nevertheless, it's a good cast. Nobody's phoning it in. They're all present and laying it on with a \r\ntrowel, including Rufus Sewell (star of \"Dark City\") as the architect \r\nUrshu\u2014who has the snitty defiance of a young Tony Curtis\u2014and \r\nGeoffrey Rush as Set and Horus' grandfather, the sun god Ra, who lives on an\r\n orbital platform in space, and spends eternity using his sun-bolt lance\r\n to zap a giant black leviathan-worm that wants to eat its way \r\nthrough the planet. (No point using this movie to cheat on your mythology \r\nfinal, kids.) Most of the lines in Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless' screenplay are delivered straight, without winks, even if they're clearly meant to provoke applause or knowing laughter. (Perusing the skyscraper-sized tower Set ordered Urshu to build for him, he asks, \"Could it be any taller?\")\u00a0 \"Gods of Egypt\" has a vision, cockeyed though it may be. There are airborne chariots drawn by winged beetles \r\nand flocks of birds, an Indiana Jones-style treasure trove rigged with \r\nbooby-traps, and a bracelet that repels 42 different demons. When gods \r\nare cut, they bleed gold. After Urshu walks in on Set during a post-coital moment, the newly-crowned king of Egypt rolls out of bed and dons a smoking jacket covered in multicolored metal beads; it looks like something Prince would wear to a bar mitzvah.  It's a shame that \"Gods of Egypt\" is unable to resolve key conflicts except by having characters fight \r\non top of pyramids and mountaintops while the camera whirls around them, or run away from theoretically enormous yet oddly \r\nweightless monsters and falling objects, just like every other big budget action film clogging up multiplexes. Things fly this way, things \r\nfall that way; people leap through the air on wires and yell \"Aaaauuuugggggh!\"; Dolby digital sound \r\neffects go boom and creeeeaaaaak and boooosh and the editing \r\ngoes cut-cut-cut-cut to hide that few of the images are composed strikingly enough to linger on. The movie could have been a work in the mode of \"Barbarella\" or\r\n \"Flash Gordon\" or \"The Sword and the Sorcerer\"\u2014larks that \r\nwere cobbled together from scraps of their decade's cinematic and design and fashion cliches, yet formed into works of true personality, films that were simultaneously self-aware and innocent.

{"Title": "Wish I Was Here", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "People get angry about Zach Braff. First there was the backlash against the hugely popular \"Garden State,\" his first feature; backlash that seemed out of proportion with the film itself. And then, 10 years later, came Braff\u2019s crowdfunding campaign for his second feature, \"Wish I Was Here,\" co-written by Braff and his brother Adam. Braff had been unable to find anyone willing to give him money so he turned to his fan base. In 48 hours, the film was fully funded, which speaks volumes about the love his fans have for what he does. But, again, that campaign launched a library of worried and sometimes angry think-pieces about crowdfunding (should it be used by famous people, especially someone like Braff who is so well-paid for his television work?), the state of movie-making, and all things Braff. Advertisement While there were some good points made about the problems with Braff\u2019s situation, the rage again seemed out of proportion (at least to this observer). If Kickstarter had been around when Cassavetes had to stop production of \"Opening Night\" in the middle of filming because he ran out of money and had to run around begging for more cash, it is not impossible to imagine Cassavetes going that crowdfunding route. \u00a0It is also not impossible to imagine that Orson Welles would have set up a Kickstarter campaign instead of having to spend his time wining and dining \"hustling semi-Armenian Russians\u201d to give him money to complete (or even start) his projects. Not that Braff is comparable as a director to Welles or Cassavetes. But, as Braff said, in a recent interview with RogerEbert.com editor Brian Tallerico, \u201cThe system is broken.\u201d He wanted to make the movie he wanted to make. Kickstarter helped him do that. So what about \"Wish I Was Here\"? Any good? Yes. It is good. It is sincere, funny, thoughtful and spiritual, often poignant, and with a deep strain of existential worry running underneath the whole thing. The worry is not eradicated at the end. But maybe the characters can find a life that suits them, that pleases them, in the midst of worrying about what it all means. At its best, \"Wish I Was Here,\" (the title alone expressing the disconnect so many of us feel about actually experiencing the minutia of our own lives) is all about that. It doesn\u2019t break new ground, but it is a personal film, something audiences are hungry for, with Braff\u2019s particular spin on the universe. \"Wish I Was Here\" is a good story with interesting characters, thoughtfully told. Aidan Bloom (Zach Braff), is a harried and harassed father of two kids, an unemployed actor, still auditioning for bit parts on series on the SyFy channel. He could be the character in \"Garden State,\" only 10 years down the line. Aidan\u2019s wife Sarah (Kate Hudson) works for the L.A. Water Department, and endures sexual harassment from her cubicle-mate, but she is the bread-winner in the family, and can\u2019t quit. Their lives have been set up to support Aidan\u2019s dream, a dream that is slowly dying, but Aidan can\u2019t let go of it. And Sarah is losing patience with the entire situation. Advertisement The pressure cooker of the Bloom domestic drama is intensified by the presence of Aidan\u2019s father Gabe (Mandy Patinkin), who has learned he is dying of cancer. Aidan\u2019s father raised his two sons Aidan and Noah (Josh Gad) in the Jewish faith, only to see them both fall away from it. Aidan has married a \u201chalf-Jew,\u201d protests Gabe at one point, and Gabe is mortified that Aidan isn\u2019t even man enough to support his own family. And Noah, who was thought to be a genius when he was a child, has now dropped off the grid, and lives in a trailer on the cliffs by the beach, dreaming about \u201cbecoming a blogger.\u201d Gabe finances the education of Aidan\u2019s children, Grace (played beautifully by Joey King) and Tucker (Pierce Gagnon), paying the tuition at an extremely conservative private Jewish school. The children have embraced their Jewish identity to such a degree that Grace is looking forward to shaving her head one day and putting on a wig. Aidan refers to his children as \u201cbrainwashed matzah balls.\u201d Grace rolls her eyes. When Gabe can no longer pay the tuition because he needs the money for his cancer treatment, the kids are pulled out of their beloved school and Aidan begins a disastrous course of home-schooling. The film doesn\u2019t quite hold together, and there are some digressions that feel pointless (the Comic-Con visit being a prime example). There is also an ongoing motif involving a spaceman running through the woods or across a desert, accompanied by a floating beeping bot, and it\u2019s meant to be representative of\u2026a mixture of the games Aidan and Noah used to play when they were kids and a sense of approaching mortality; it's something along those lines, but it\u2019s too vague to know for sure. The spaceman sequences lack emotional reverb and don't add to what we are seeing elsewhere. Advertisement The rest of the film makes up for it, though, with good scene after good scene, allowed to play out. Aidan and Sarah sit at a lifeguard station on the beach at night, talking about their lives, trying to re-connect as a couple. Sarah, who has always had a wary relationship with her judgmental father-in-law, has a killer scene with him in the hospital, where she tells him, in no uncertain terms, what his two adult sons need from him. Both Hudson and Patinkin are incredible in that scene. There are amazing scenes between Aidan and his kids, especially his daughter. He is baffled by Grace, and wants to be there for her, and doesn't know what she needs. The script is quite funny, with some casually tossed-off one liners that don\u2019t feel too-clever or like punch lines, but feel the way people actually talk when they are exasperated and at their wits\u2019 end. Aidan comments on a guy who drives a ridiculous vehicle: \u201cWho drives a yellow Hummer? What \u2026 is he going to war? On the sun?\u201d Aidan\u2019s backyard pool is empty and weed-ridden, and Aidan\u2019s father takes a look at it and says to his son, \u201cNice little slice of Mumbai you got back here.\u201d And then there is the bearded black-hatted rabbi, roaring with laughter about kitten videos on Youtube, or careening through the hospital hallways on a Segway, crashing into a wall in the background. Braff has a really good eye and ear for this stuff\u2014character-based and character-driven strangeness and singularity. There are two dream-like sequences involving Aidan and his two kids which are emotional and powerful\u2014one happening during a camping trip and one happening during a \"Karate Kid\"-like rebuilding of the fence in the back yard. Both involve poetry being recited (T.S. Eliot's \"Love Song of Alfred J. Prufrock\" on the camping trip, and Robert Frost's \"Mending Wall\" in the backyard), both involve sudden slo-mo, a collage of images, the family laughing, horsing around, etc.\u2014the beautiful moments that make up the majority of our lives. Yes, life is chaos. And people die. And we need to make amends. We need to grow up and take responsibility for ourselves. But moments like a small girl wearing a bright pink wig, standing on a diving board over an empty pool, reading \"Mending Wall\" to her brother and father, who are busy repairing the back fence, are the glue and the concrete that hold families together. Braff understands that, and prioritizes that in how he films these two beautiful scenes. Advertisement There is one stunning image of Aidan and his two children, each perched on a separate rock out in the desert, black-silhouettes against the dreamy lavender sunset, talking about things, like what the word \"epiphany\" means. There is an openness between the characters, an accessibility. It's refreshing. The acting is excellent across the board. The music is extremely intrusive, something that was true in \"Garden State\" as well. Not only is it intrusive, but it is predictable: A scene plays out with no music in the background, and the actors are doing their work and doing it well. The scene is landing. Two or three lines before the ending of the scene\u2026in comes the music cue. The timing was so predictable I could have set my watch by it. The work is already there on the screen, and the music ends up feeling manipulative when the story itself is not. It's one of Braff's \"tics\" and it's in full gear in \"Wish I Was Here.\" Annoying as that was, the story got to me. The characters got to me. Death is at the end of the road for all of us but, to quote T.S. Eliot's poem again, a masterpiece of anxiety: And indeed there will be timeTo wonder, \u201cDo I dare?\u201d and, \u201cDo I dare? Everyone is on a quest. Everyone needs to ask, \"Do I dare?\" in order to make meaningful changes. We are held back from connecting to one another due to preconceived notions about what life should be like, or disappointments in ourselves and in each other, or the regular old stress of everyday life. \"Wish I Was Here\" shows what happens when people are forced to slow down, assess their lives,\u00a0and ask the big questions; face the big moments, death,\u00a0and disappointment. We are stronger than we realize.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Hacksaw Ridge", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Hacksaw Ridge,\" about a pacifist who won the Medal of Honor without firing a shot, is a mess. It makes hash of its plainly stated moral code by reveling in the same blood-lust it condemns. But it's also one of the few original action movies released in the last decade, and one of the only studio releases this year that could sincerely be described as a religious picture. Of course, it's directed by Mel Gibson, who rose to international stardom in R-rated action flicks and went on to become the true heir to Sam Peckinpah, directing a series of astoundingly violent films with cores of spirituality: \"Braveheart,\" \"The Passion of the Christ\" and \"Apocalypto.\" True to form, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" draws equally on Gibson's bottomless thirst for mayhem and his sincerely held religious beliefs\u2014or some of them, anyway. It's a movie at war with itself. Advertisement The first half lays out the childhood and adolescence of its hero, Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), a Seventh-day Adventist turned U.S. Army corporal. Set in Virginia hill country in the '20s and '30s, it's shot in the creamy hues of a Norman Rockwell painting, and filled with earnest, Old Hollywood-styled exchanges about violence and pacifism. The second half is set during the Battle of Okinawa, where Doss, who described himself as a \"conscientious collaborator\" rather than objector, rescued 75 fellow infantrymen injured by the Japanese; it feels like an attempt to one-up the D-Day sequence in \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and if sheer bloody explosive nastiness were the only measure, you'd have to declare \"Hacksaw Ridge\" the winner. The combat pays nearly as much attention to the rending, burning and perforating of flesh as it does to the hero's anguish and ingenuity. Gibson shows soldiers using mortar shells as homemade grenades (as in the climax of \"Saving Private Ryan\"), shifts into glorious slow-motion to showcase a soldier kicking an enemy's lobbed grenade away, and treats us to the surreal and inappropriately comic sight of Doss towing a paraplegic infantryman on a homemade sled while the man cuts down bushels of Japanese soldiers with a sub-machine gun.  This stuff feels like a violation of the spirit of Doss' moral code, if not its letter. But the first half, which channels the majestic squareness of a John Ford family drama, is weird, too. It's myth-making with a dash of self-help and Scripture, but Gibson keeps trying to jazz things up with violence or the threat of violence, even when the scenes don't seem to call for it. Familiar movie situations, such as Doss taking his future wife Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) out on a date or getting to know his bunk-mates, are interrupted by horror movie-style jump scares or fused to bits of black comic suspense (we know somebody's going to get maimed by the knife that a soldier is brandishing when Doss enters the barracks; the only questions are which one and when). This is the directorial equivalent of Gibson the actor working Three  Stooges shtick into otherwise straightforward dialogue scenes\u2014either a nervous tic or a compulsion. The wide shots of corpses piled up, the shots of Doss posed like Christ or lit by heavenly sunlight streaming through windows, and the moments when Doss treats enemy soldiers with compassion, are a lot more on-message.  All that said, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" seems aware of its inability to present  the horrors of war in a consistently non-thrilling, non-cool way. There are  even moments where the film seems ashamed that it can't live up to Doss' example\u2014particularly when other characters question Doss' belief that  violence is never justified and that there is no real distinction between killing  and murder. What you see on other characters' faces in these scenes is not contempt but incredulity, followed by petulance and finally denial. They can feel the truth of what Doss is saying. But they can't imagine the world being anything other than what it is, a place ruled by brute force and cruelty. The rifles that Doss refuses to pick up are described as girls, women, mates, \"perhaps the only thing in life you'll truly love.\" The other soldiers' crude sexual talk and casual sadism are contrasted with Doss' sweetness, piety and chastity. Doss' drill sergeant (Vince Vaughn, effectively typecast as a  charismatic bully) and other commanding officers keep pressuring Doss to  pick up a rifle. When he refuses,  they humiliate him and sign off on his hazing; his own platoon-mates call him \"coward\" and \"pussy.\" They don't want to break or kill Doss, just drive him from their sight, perhaps so they won't have to second-guess themselves each time they lay eyes on him. Advertisement It's worth pointing out here that Doss is the child of an alcoholic World War I veteran, Tom (Hugo Weaving). The film's own contradictions are embodied in Doss' dad. He preaches the virtues of nonviolence, rails against the romanticizing of war, visits the graves of childhood friends killed at the Battle of Belleau Wood, and doesn't want Doss or his older brother Hal (Nathaniel Buzolic) to enlist after Pearl Harbor. But he's also self-pitying, quick to anger, and beats his wife Bertha (Rachel Griffiths) and their sons. He wants to change and knows why he should. But he can't.  Tom Doss' drinking problem feels like more than just a biographical detail. The script, credited to Andrew Knight and playwright Robert Schenkkan  (\"All the Way\"), keeps returning to Tom. The hero's pacifism seems as  much a rejection of his dad's angry brokenness and inability to control  his temper as a reaction to almost killing his brother in a  childhood scuffle. Also of interest: like Sam Peckinpah, Gibson has struggled with alcoholism, he has bipolar disorder and rage issues as well, and as an artist he is addicted to violence. In its more thoughtful moments, the film treats intoxication with violence, both real and fictional, as a species-wide addiction\u2014one that can't easily be broken. I'd be shocked if a director as attuned to mythic signifiers as Gibson weren't trying, in his own fumbling way, to explore this idea. Too bad action-film awesomeness is the intoxicant that \"Hacksaw Ridge\" can't quit. You feel the movie fighting to suppress its urge to glorify violence and treat the Japanese as sinister hordes. Even in non-war scenes, it can't stop reaching for the bottle, and there's a wave of shame when it falls off the wagon. A lingering close-up of guts and goop is followed by a shot of the hero looking appalled or terrified, as if to rebuke the director's gifts.  \"Hacksaw Ridge\" seems to know that its hero is better than anyone around him, perhaps better than the movie that tells his story. This comes through strongly in the relationship between Doss and fellow infantryman Smitty (Luke Bracey), a far more convincing love story than the one between Doss and his gal. Of course Smitty loathes and torments Doss, then comes to respect and even revere him. The way Smitty looks at Doss during the battle of Okinawa recalls the way the disciples gazed upon Jesus in Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\"\u2014as a promise and a mystery; a person so strikingly different from other people, so fully formed, so serenely and undeniably good, that he seems more angel than man. Garfield's performance humanizes him. For a long time you think Doss is an idealized figure, free of neuroses and complications. But after a while you see the darkness in him, and you believe it exists because of the thoughtful way Garfield has prepared you.\u00a0  This film is inept and beautiful, stupid and amazing. It doesn't have the words or images to express how deep it is. That's why it's more interesting to talk about than it is to watch. I wonder what the real Doss, who died in 2006, would have thought of it.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Super Dark Times", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "A strong and specific mood can cover up a multitude of sins in a film. Mood can hypnotize an audience, scare them, capture them in a rhythm and not let them go. In \"Super Dark Times,\" director Kevin Phillips, in his feature film debut, creates a mood from the opening shot, a mood sustained wonderfully well, even if the third act moves into cliched territory. What matters in \"Super Dark Times\" is not what happens. We've seen it all before. What matters is how\u00a0it happens, and how the landscape\u2014a picturesque New England town\u2014seeps into the characters' psyches as a kind of cold and lonely malaise. If you just heard the plot points, you might think you know what \"Super Dark Times\" is. It's a story of adolescent boys, virginal and frustrated, whose latent violence (a direct result of repression) leads to a tragedy and then a frantic cover-up. But \"Super Dark Times\" has something different to offer, a dark and wintry mood so oppressive that even the treetops look ominous, sentinels looking down unfeelingly on the follies of man. \"Super Dark Times\" has a deeply unnerving mood, more unnerving than \"what happens.\" Advertisement The film takes place in the early 1990s, already a lost era, with fuzzy static on the television, landline telephones with antennae, and\u2014most importantly\u2014groups of bored teenagers with lots of free time having to entertain themselves. Zach (Owen Campbell) and Josh (Charlie Tahan) are best friends, first seen looking through a yearbook and drooling over their female classmates, bragging about the various sex acts they would do with them if they had the chance. The script is by Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski, but the dialogue is a rough and improvisational. They feel like real boys. Zach and Josh hang out with a younger kid in middle school (Sawyer Barth) and a big obnoxious kid named Daryl (Max Talisman). They don't do much. They ride their bikes to a convenient store. They wander around, talking about masturbation and girls (their lack of experience blaring off the screen like a bullhorn). They swear a lot, in a self-conscious performative way. Nobody has after-school activities. They're all latchkey kids. One day, after smoking weed for the first time, they play around in a deserted park with a gleaming sword, stolen from the bedroom of Josh's older brother who's now in the Marines. Things get horribly out of hand with that sword and someone ends up dead. What follows is out of the \"What Not To Do\" playbook, but what elevates \"Super Dark Times\" above similar fare is its devotion to the harrowing emotional fallout of such an event. These young actors are phenomenal in their ability to go as deep as they do. Screaming and crying and shouting, they never feel like little psychos. They feel like panicked, pimpled boys, which they are. With each scene, the boys look younger and more vulnerable. Zach is the center of the film. He lives alone with his mother (Amy Hargreaves, who just played a similar role in Netflix's \"13 Reasons Why\"). Perhaps the clearest indication that \"Super Dark Times\" does not take place in 2017 is her blase reaction to her son's busted-up knuckles. \"You'd better clean that,\" she says. Zach has a sweet friendship with a girl named Allison (Elizabeth Cappuccino), who is clearly interested in him and begging him (nonverbally) to do something about it, but he doesn't know how to make a pass. Their scenes together are wonderfully subtle. Phillips (and cinematographer Eli Born) use the landscape to tell the story. White church spires peek above the treetops, the little ranch houses are cozy. But if you look beyond the surface\u2014and Phillips and Born do\u2014there's something very weird about this town. Even before the main event occurs, there are subtle and not-so-subtle indications that something is very, very wrong. A huge bridge is closed off, the kind of bridge providing access to the world outside. Kids sneak out there to fool around on its rusted decaying railings. There are dilapidated factories covered in graffiti. Parks and streets are empty. Where is everybody? Advertisement The film's opening sequence is a stunner, setting the mood that will carry the rest of the film: Static shots of trees silhouetted against cold blue light, empty lots, a school's windows reflecting the dying gleams of sunset. One of the windows is smashed. Inside, lying in a pool of blood, is a gigantic antlered deer, body gasping for breath. It's a horrifying and unexplained event. The deer leapt through the window for unknown reasons. Nobody mentions it again, but the deer haunts \"Super Dark Times.\" Everyone is in the process of self-destruction. There are other weird glimpses. A kid in a soccer uniform races down a crowded school hallway, sobbing loudly, kids staring at him as he barrels past. A girl in the school library throws a tantrum and is tossed out. We never see these kids again, but they add to the sense that something here is completely out of control. Clinton is president, seen making speeches on television. The myth is that it was a more innocent era. Pre-9/11. Pre-2008 economic crash. But like some of the films highlighted in Charles Taylor's wonderful book Opening\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0at a Theater or Drive-In Near You\u00a0(I interviewed Taylor\u00a0for this site), \"Super Dark Times\" is a genre film that has things to say about the world in which we live, its emptiness and the chasm between cause and effect. Bored kids lie on couches waiting for their distracted parents to get home, watching politicians on TV speak of opportunity and progress. There's a complete disconnect. These kids are scarily unmoored. In Billy Wilder's famous rules for writers, #6 on the list is \"If you have a problem with the third act, the real problem is in the first act.\" The third act issues in \"Super Dark Times\"\u2014when everything comes to a head\u2014can be traced back to the first act, but, crucially, Phillips has done the important work of prioritizing mood over story. Because of this, the denouement does not ring as hollow as it might otherwise. Phillips has shown us a bleak world, an empty world, a world void of effective adults, where children have nowhere to go and nothing to do but turn on one another, or cling to one another. There's no way out. The bridge is closed for good. It's decayed beyond repair. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Catfight", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Money doesn't make you mean and being poor doesn't make you nice. Jerks cross class lines. Jerks are born, not made. At least that's partially the premise of writer/director Onur Tukel\u2019s semi-satirical \"Catfight,\" starring Sandra Oh as Veronica, a wretchedly unpleasant trophy wife, and Anne Heche as Ashley, a struggling angry artist who is equally awful. The two women hated one another on sight when they met in college, and that hatred blossoms into something even more toxic when they run into one another by chance at a catered affair. It's so toxic that the two women have a brawl in a stairwell that leaves Veronica in a coma for two years. When she wakes up, her whole world has changed. And that's just the beginning. Advertisement This sounds like the plot of a melodrama to end all melodramas, or a \"woman's picture\" seen through a pitch-black lens, but the overall tone is deadpan. The women's fury erupts out of that deadpan, making both of them look absurd, like clowns having fake-fights for a howling audience of idiots. This is all played for laughs and for the most part, the laughs do come. These two talented actresses push the envelope in unlikability to the limit and there's something very cathartic about that. There's a scene where Ashley rips her assistant to shreds for using a blue shipping label, and Heche plays it real, ratcheting up her attack into such emotional violence that it's terrifying. To make matters weirder, \"Catfight\" takes place in a fictional time eerily close to our own where a new president has declared \"war on the Middle East\" and that war will require all hands on deck. Nobody seems to question it. Or even pay attention. On the television screens in every room, a late-night TV host cracks jokes about the dire state of the world before calling onto the stage the \"Fart Machine,\" a guy who farts on command while the studio audience howls with laughter. It's clear now just how prophetic Mike Judge's 2006 film \"Idiocracy\" really was. Both women live in a nightmare of domesticity. Veronica's husband Stanley (Damian Young) is a war profiteer, and a mean-spirited version of the husband role Young played in Lisa Kudrow's HBO series \"The Comeback.\" Ashley lives with Lisa (Alicia Silverstone) in a state of constantly simmering tension. Lisa is the breadwinner, does not like Ashley's ugly paintings, and wants to start a family. Lisa seems semi-normal at first, although there's a later scene at a baby shower that Silverstone plays brilliantly, one of the most openly funny scenes in \"Catfight,\" where Silverstone reveals just how passive-aggressive and snotty her character is. Lisa smiles at Ashley in a way that looks\u00a0supportive, but on a closer glance you can see the irritation and contempt. It's a very funny performance. Advertisement The women have three fights in the film, and each one is a major affair, messier versions of the knock-down drag-outs that fill \"John Wick\" end to end. They take place in, respectively, a stairwell, a vacant lot and a forest glade. Attention must be paid to Balint Pinczehelyi, who did the superb fight choreography. The fights are operatic, raucous and extremely violent. They go on so long they practically rival the epic fight scene in \"The Quiet Man.\" Stunt doubles were used, but Oh and Heche are clearly doing a lot of their own stunts, and they are so ferocious it's obvious these characters actually mean\u00a0to kill one another. It's common to say that we live in a very literal age, an age where satire is dead, where people credulously share Onion articles on Facebook (and then dig their heels in when it's pointed out to them the article is not real: \"Well, it COULD be real.\" Yes. That's satire.) But every age has its sacred cows, and satire chips away at those cows, at the privileged, at society's unquestioned structures and assumptions. \"Catfight\" is not at that level (satire is the most difficult genre to do well), and the film's tone is a hard one to sustain. The fights anchor the narrative, as do the various mirroring effects, with dialogue repeating and situations on an eternal loop. The world Tukel creates is one that is falling apart quickly. The country's atmosphere is that of Total War. The self-involved populace adjusts to it automatically. \"Catfight\" shows that civilization is an extremely fragile veneer over a pit of seething venom. It doesn't take much for that veneer to crack. And instead of pouring all their rage onto the powers-that-be who really deserve it\u2014the people sending kids off to war, the television host parading a Fart Machine as entertainment, the audience who finds the Fart Machine funny, the entire unfair ugly world\u2014these women turn it on one another. \"Catfight\" is not the story of two gals who hate each other and then realize, over appletinis, how much they have in common. Tukel takes that tired clich\u00e9 and blows it to smithereens. Let's hear it for unvarnished hatred expressed with no holds barred. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}

{"Title": "Tomorrowland", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Early in Brad Bird's science fiction adventure \"Tomorrowland,\" there's a flashback to one of the film's heroes visiting the 1964 World's Fair as a child and sampling Walt Disney's \"It's a Small World\" ride, with its invasively cheerful music and shimmying puppets; suddenly it whisks the park visitor, a boy who came there with a homemade jet pack hoping to win an inventor's contest, into a utopian future full of Art Deco skyscrapers and monorails, and watches him fall and rise through soupy clouds, courtesy of his flame-spitting invention. Advertisement Thus does an actual theme park ride become a high-tech cinematic version of a theme park ride. The first ride is gentle, nostalgic and charming. The second is dazzling and intense\u2014a masterpiece of choreography, editing, design, sound effects and music, plus a bit of chill-inducing dream logic: at one point, the boy falls while his jet pack plummets a few meters to his left, and to reach it, he kicks his arms and legs like a swimmer chasing a life preserver. \"Tomorrowland\" has many uncanny dream-logic moments like that one.  They make the film worth seeing, even though it's better as an experience than as a story or a message, yet wants to be all three at once. There's a plot of sorts, something about a teenage girl (Britt Robertson's Casey) seeking out a greying scientist (George Clooney's Frank Walker) who knows how to access the aforementioned future, where brilliant scientists and other special individuals have created a pristine new world in advance of this one's death. The boy in the World's Fair sequence, young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson), is befriended by a freckle-faced young English girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who has a secret that I won't reveal here, except to say that it helps the others wriggle free of seemingly inescapable jams.  There are fuzzy or stilted warnings, courtesy of co-writers Bird and Damon Lindelof (\"Star Trek Into Darkness\"), about the plight of extraordinary individuals in an ordinary world, and the price we'll eventually pay for despoiling the environment and demonizing science. Bird has been criticized for infusing \"The Incredibles\" and \"Ratatouille\" with simplistic and sometimes elitist-sounding statements about the privileges that should accrue to gifted people. He'll get raked over the coals again here, thanks to the future's \"Atlas Shrugged\"-style origin story: the world's great scientific minds decided they'd had enough of ignorance and apathy and made their own world that's part Shangri-La and part Emerald City of Oz, but functionally Noah's Ark. Advertisement The plot has a raggedy quality, often leaning on a squad of \r\n\"Matrix\"-like, passing-for-human assassins and composer Michael \r\nGiacchino's \"Behold the magic!\" score to gin up tension. At its worst, it raises basic creative questions that are a far cry from its philosophical and moral concerns:\u00a0Is the heroine special because she truly has special qualities, or \r\nbecause the \"You are the chosen one\" thing lets Bird barrel through two \r\nhours without having to give Casey any traits besides spunk? Is it a problem, story-wise and message-wise, that Frank's chief antagonist (Hugh Laurie) makes more sense than the heroes who oppose him? Maybe Bird and company would have been better off heeding Frank's advice \r\nto Casey: \"Must I explain everything to you? Can't \r\nyou just be impressed and move on?\"  But if you treat \"Tomorrowland\" mainly as an immense cinematic \r\ntheme park that unveils a new \"ride\" every few minutes\u2014just as Bird's last feature, \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\" \r\nwas mainly a series of action scenes\u2014its weaker aspects won't be deal-breakers. In this sense, if in no other, Bird's latest owes more to \r\n\"Metropolis,\" \"Blade Runner,\" \"Dark City,\" the first \"Tron\" and other works of top-shelf eye-candy \r\nthan to most of the SF-and-fantasy-tinged franchise entries that modern \r\nstudios churn out.  Bird conceives the entire \r\npicture as a series of clockwork suspense sequences involving laserguns, plasma bombs, \r\nhidden doors and gates and passageways and tunnels, vertigo-inducing\r\n climbs and falls, serpentine hover-trains, machines and structures that fold and unfold and split, and humans that might not be human. With the aid of a time-travel device that looks like a souvenir button, present-day panoramas vanish, disclosing landscapes in a \"Jetsons\" vein. There are jet \r\npacks, monorails, robots that clomp and clank, and zero-gravity swimming pools that are just puck-shaped masses of water hanging in midair.\u00a0There are moments where people exist simultaneously in two time periods while walking, running, falling or driving, and a scene near the end that's so unabashedly sentimental, yet so emotionally complex and confounding, that I can honestly say I've never seen anything like it.\u00a0 Advertisement The film is a personal work of art that seems born of stubborn\r\n passion. It's definitely not an assembly-line product, despite the way that some sequences \r\nevoke (deliberately, would seem) actual assembly lines. If it's a bit irritating or dull at times, it's because it seems clear\r\n that Bird knows why he's showing us these things, and what he hoped to\r\n achieve by visualizing them in this manner, but he and his \r\nco-writers (including co-scenarist Jeff Jensen) can't find a graceful way to communicate it. No matter. The \"message\" of \"Metropolis\"\u2014a parable of labor and capital which concludes that society needs the heart to mediate between the head and the hands\u2014was a mess, too. Today it seems at once reductive and overreaching, basically Marxism Lite. But if you had to make a list of reasons why that film is still remembered, discussed, and raided for inspiration by films like Bird's, \"message\" wouldn't be on it. \"Metropolis\" is remembered because watching it is as close as many of us will get to being able to have another person's dream.", "Critic": "Delta"}

But the film (with a couple of sick and twisted adjustments) is mostly reminiscent of the \"women's pictures\" of the 1930s and 40s, starring the shoulder-pad boss-bitches of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age, dominant dames like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck, whose characters were put through wringers involving snake-in-the-grass boyfriends/husbands, ungrateful children, career treachery. You can picture Barbara Stanwyck stuffing her dress in the trash, lighting a cigarette and then ordering takeout after being raped in the middle of her living room. You can't imagine any of those women, or Isabelle Huppert, who plays Mich\u00e8le, going to a support group or therapy. They'll gut it out on their own. The film is crowded with characters. Mich\u00e8le has a lot going on: a slacker son (Jonas Bloquet) who has an abusive pregnant girlfriend, an ex-husband (Charles Berling) now dating a young yoga teacher, a bored sex fling with a married man, an elderly Botox-ed mother (Judith Magre) carrying on an affair with a gigolo, a pressing project at work (she co-owns a video game company), a handsome married neighbor (Laurent Lafitte) whom she stares at longingly from across the street, and a complex backstory not revealed until far into the film. This woman has too much to DO to fall apart after the rape. But then she starts getting creepy texts from the unknown rapist: he knows where she is, what she's wearing. It could be anyone. Every man she knows is a suspect. She buys pepper spray (and, on impulse, a small axe) to protect herself. She says at one point, \"Nut jobs I can handle. My specialty.\" You believe her. Maybe somewhere she always expected something like this, that horror would reach out its tentacles to find her again. Verhoeven unbalances the existing tension of the \"whodunit\" aspect of \"Elle\" by giving us some pretty obvious clues early on who probably did it. Verhoeven does not \u201cbury the lede\" because he's interested in things other than the plot cranking itself out to a \"satisfying\" conclusion. He\u2019s interested in the psychology and behavior of this particular woman. His camera follows her everywhere, like a stalker, like a lover. As in life, whether we want to admit it or not, those lines are often blurred. Every interaction, not just sexual and political, contains small jostles for power, position, dominance. Who's the \"top\"? Who's the \"bottom\" in any given moment? There are competing objectives in every conversation, each side maneuvering to get what they want. Jostling for power comes in many different forms, playing out in romantic relationship, office dynamics, even in a conversation with a group of friends where you have something to say and everyone is too busy talking to give you \"the floor.\" \"Elle\" is a dissertation on power dynamics. Advertisement Verhoeven's approach is, unsurprisingly, extremely provocative. Mich\u00e8le is a woman in her early 50s, and her sexuality surges around inside her, seeking expression. It leads her into some pretty dark stuff. In real life, sex doesn't progress in a checklist of approved behaviors happening in the proper order. Sometimes people are drawn to danger, to risk. Rape fantasies are so common as to be mundane. The current view is that consent in sex is a cut-and-dry thing. Either you consent, or you don't. There is no doubt that the rape in \"Elle\" is horrifying. Verhoeven does not eroticize it. The rapist wipes the blood from Michele's vagina off of his hip bone as he gets up off of her. But later in the film, when Mich\u00e8le does consent to sex, enthusiastically, watch how her lover is unnerved by a woman who wants it, who doesn't have to be talked into it. He's almost turned off by her sexual agency. And that, ultimately, is the most cutting observation in \"Elle,\" and Verhoeven's aim is accurate and deadly. Men not knowing what to do with a woman who wants sex and knows how she wants it, men needing to be the \"top,\" always, threatened by a woman taking the \"top\" role (not in sexual positions, but in attitude) ... well. These issues have been with us from the beginning of time, and won't be solved overnight. But \"Elle\" is one of the smartest films about consent I've ever seen. Isabelle Huppert does not make even an unconscious bid for our sympathy. She never has, throughout her lengthy career and it is one of the things that distinguishes her from other actresses. Even very talented actresses want to make sure that we \"understand\" why the character does what she does. Huppert doesn't care. She's completely beyond those concerns. It's why she's so thrilling to watch and why she is in such rare company (Anna Magnani, Liv Ullmann, Gena Rowlands, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford... it's a short list). There's always some element of mystery left intact in Huppert's work. Huppert can be frighteningly blank (\"The Piano Teacher,\" \"La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie\"), she can be human and flawed (\"Amour,\" and the upcoming \"Things to Come\"). In \"Elle\" she gets to be funny, and it's such a joy to watch! It's effortless for her. She's funny in her line-readings (\"Bimbos with big tits never worried me, but the girl who's read 'The Second Sex' will chew you up...\"), in her gestures and expressions. You cannot take your eyes off of her. Neither can Verhoeven. In a Q&A following the public screening at the New York Film Festival, Verhoeven described Huppert (also in attendance) as \"unique in the world.\" She is. Watching \"Elle\" feels like climbing Everest without an oxygen tank. The air is dizzyingly clear up there. And dangerous, too.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Ballet 422", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Art isn\u2019t easy. That\u2019s the main \u201ctakeaway\u201d from this brisk\r\nand engaging documentary, directed by Jody Lee Lipes. After a few text notes\r\nexplaining who the main players are\u2014they are the New York City Ballet and a\r\ndancer/choreographer named Justin Peck\u2014\u201cBallet 422\u201d chronicles the creation of\r\nthe four-hundred-and-twenty-second original ballet mounted by the company, from\r\nits conception to opening night.  As in the films of documentarians David and Albert Maysles\r\nand Frederick Wiseman, this true-life chronicle eschews both narration and\r\non-camera interview. Justin Peck does not explain the premise of his ballet,\r\nhis reason for choosing the music (\u201cSinfonietta La Jolla\u201d by 20th-century\r\ncomposer Bohuslav Martinu), or any such thing; instead, Lipes\u2019 cameras show him\r\nthinking and working in an empty rehearsal room with a boom box, or in his\r\nquiet walk-up apartment. Soon he\u2019s laying out moves for his lead dancers,\r\nconferring with the costume designers, lighting directors, the orchestra\r\nconductors, and so on.  Advertisement The process as chronicled by Lipes is relatively drama-free\r\nbut extremely labor intensive. Nobody\u2019s a diva, voices are never raised,\r\nthere\u2019s no last-minute crisis. Which isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t tension, or\r\nirony, or interest. Part of the magic of the dance, if you\u2019re a fan of it (it\u2019s\r\nnot really my cup of tea, but you can\u2019t like EVERYTHING), is the illusion that\r\nthe work you\u2019re watching has just been conjured out of thin air, and all of the\r\nmembers of the team creating Peck\u2019s ballet are master illusionists. But they\u2019re\r\nalso people with jobs, and the movie does an excellent job of showing the\r\ncommonplace workaday atmosphere that is, in fact, a big part of that business\r\nwe call show.  Peck is quiet, conscientious, dedicated, and well-mannered,\r\nwhich is in pretty stark contrast to Brock Enright, the subject of Lipes\u2019 2009\r\nfilm \u201cGood Times Will Never Be The Same,\u201d which depicted Enright generally being the worst person in the world, and ended with\r\nthe nightmare vision of his actually spawning. But Lipes also depicted Enright\r\nas a guy with a work ethic. So there IS a thematic throughline here,\r\nauteurists. The irony of Peck\u2019s position is, while he\u2019s on the rise as a\r\nchoreographer, as a dancer he\u2019s in a rather more plebian position, which\r\nprovides the movie with a punchline that Lipes neither overstates nor shrugs\r\noff. The movie, which sticks to a relatively rough-and-ready handheld visual\r\nstyle for the most part (Lipes\u2019 is largely known for his work as a\r\ncinematographer; he\u2019s collaborated closely with Lena Dunham and shot Judd Apatow\u2019s\r\nupcoming \u201cTrainwreck\u201d), ends on a very beautiful and still shot of the site of\r\nthe City Ballet that will remind New York-based viewers of their cultural\r\nprivilege, and maybe goad them into taking advantage of it more often. Heck, I\r\nwas thinking maybe of checking out a ballet, even.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Inside Llewyn Davis", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "We cannot imagine Llewyn Davis happy. The self-defeating Sisyphus of the new film written, directed, and edited by Joel and Ethan Coen is the first person the viewer lays eyes on in the movie. Bearded, his unkempt hair falling in his eyes, he picks out some steely, blue notes on a guitar as he sings \"Hang Me, Oh Hang Me,\" not to be confused with \"Dang Me.\" \"Wouldn't mind the hangin', except for layin' in the grave so long,\" he sings, with a good amount of sincerity. The time is 1961, the place is New York City, and the venue where Llewyn\u2014portrayed with haunting conviction by Oscar Isaac, who, like everyone else in the cast, does his own singing and playing\u2014is picking and not grinning is the Gaslight, a soon-to-be-legendary landmark in the \"folk revival.\"  Advertisement Llewyn, as talented as he is, does not look to be one of that revival's future success stories. Why? For one thing, he's the protagonist of a Coen brothers movie. For another, after he finishes his song, the place's glib, slick, runty owner Pappi, directs Llewyn outside to see a \"friend\" who's been asking for him. Outside Llewyn finds no friend, but instead a suited, fedora-sporting stranger who exchanges a few words with the singer before calmly kicking and punching the daylights out of him.  And then Llewyn wakes up. And there's just the most adorable orange cat staring him in the face.  \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" is the most satisfyingly diabolical cinematic structure that the Coens have ever contrived, and that's just one reason that I suspect it may be their best movie yet. How Llewyn inadvertently inherits, loses, then re-finds, and kind of adopts, the aforementioned cat is one of the more involved traps of the movie's plot, which may make the wary viewer, or the all-around anti-Coenite, suspect that this is some kind of exercise in auteurial sadism, a charge the brothers themselves laid themselves open to when they admitted that in concocting 2009's great \"A Serious Man\" they thoroughly enjoyed torturing their lead character.  This movie\u2014which can reasonably be described as feeling like a '70s Wim Wenders picture scripted by Billy Wilder and/or Preston Sturges from a story by Terry Southern\u2014is different. Yes, Llewyn is an incorrigible screw-up, having, among other things, impregnated a friend who also happens to be the wife of another friend, two halves of the very palatable-to-the-mainstream female/male singing duo Jean and Jim (Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake). He's kind of hard to like, given his surly defensiveness.\u00a0 Advertisement But this movie doesn't give the impression that he's someone his creators like to push around. Indeed, there's a sense of not-quite-grudging empathy going on here. There's a scene early on in which Llewyn's at the Gaslight watching a new act, a not-bad but pretty vanilla folkie named Troy Nelson (Stark Sands). Besides being an army guy, he's also taking up couch space at Llewyn's second-favorite crash pad. After his own song, Troy invites Jean and Jim up to sing with him, and they do a nice version of \"Five Hundred Miles.\" Llewyn does his level best to enjoy them, but soon the audience starts singing along, and Llewyn furrows his brow a little and looks behind him with wordless incredulity. The place he thought he understood, the place he thought he was part of, is becoming alien to him. And he doesn't understand why. Well, he understands why a little bit. Like all of his associates in the movie, Llewyn is mourning a loss, a loss that has made him a solo act, a solo act with a box of unsold records and no winter coat as the days grow darker and shorter The chip on his shoulder is part of his new defense (who knows, maybe it's not new; the movie is cannily selective about revealing its back story), but he still thinks he's got something to prove. After defiantly telling his sister that, no, he won't be going back to the Merchant Marine for a stint at sea, he impulsively joins\u2014with cat in tow\u2014a dyspeptic, shambling jazz musician and his doggerel-mumbling beatnik \"valet\" (John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund, respectively) on an ill-fated road trip to Chicago. It's a pilgrimage of sorts, to present himself to a reigning folk impresario played by F. Murray Abraham. Dryly noting the title of Llewyn's solo record, this man requests, \"Play me something from 'Inside Llewyn Davis.'\" And so Llewyn does. In both senses of the term.  It's a devastating scene in a movie full of devastating scenes. And full of quick, devastating observations. There's a whole movie in one shot of Llewyn's left foot, which he just inadvertently plunged into an ice puddle, slipping out of its loafer as he sits at a diner counter and tries in vain to squeeze the freezing cold out of his soaked sock. The beautiful, cloud-gray and autumn-leaf ocher cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel doesn't just cast a mood, it conjures a mode of existence. Moving, funny (but not frivolous; the characters never turn into cartoons), brilliant, it's a rib-sticking movie that represents a new high for its creators.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "A Night in Old Mexico", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Red Bovie (Robert Duvall) is a cranky old curmudgeon, long estranged from his son. He is being forced out of his home by a developer who is going to create \"ranchettes\" on the old family ranch in Texas. Red is bitter, rude, and irascible. If he wasn't played by Robert Duvall, you wouldn't want to spend any time in his presence whatsoever. Even still, \"A Night in Old Mexico,\" directed by Emilio Aragon and written by \"Lonesome Dove\" writer Bill Wittliff, is pretty tough going. Duvall is one of our finest actors and he dominates the screen, even in the simplest moments: the small laughs to himself, the murmured asides, the squinting of his eyes as he assesses a situation. He's riveting. But to what purpose? The film is cliched and phony, the coincidences beggar belief, and the human relationships come from a very tired playbook. Duvall can justify it all, he's just that kind of actor, but \"A Night in Old Mexico\" hasn't worked hard enough to give him a story worthy of his talents. In many cases, he is acting all alone up there. Advertisement \"A Night in Old Mexico\" tells the story of Red Bovie's last hurrah in Mexico. He has fled from the scene of his depressing new digs, a dusty trailer park, dragging along his city-boy grandson Gally (Jeremy Irvine), who just happens to show up unannounced at the very moment of Red's eviction. Red wants to go to Mexico, get drunk and find a woman for the night. The old boy's still got some kick in him! Along the way, they pick up two guys who (coincidentally) have just double-crossed a Mexican gangster and are carrying a bag full of cash. Red eventually kicks them out of the car but the bag is left behind. Red walks through the crowded streets of Mexico with a spring in his step, girl-watching and saying hello to everyone, with Gally being prudish and judgmental at his side, exclaiming in horror at one point, \"This is a house of prostitution!\" Jeremy Irvine, as Gally, is in over his head as an actor. His responses to Duvall range from \"annoyed\" to \"a little bit more annoyed\" to \"really super annoyed.\" The emotional journey of the grandson, who is looking to re-connect with his country roots and get to know his grandfather, is certainly present in Wittliff's script, but Irvine plays it on a skin-deep level. He can't hold his own with Duvall, and in some of the larger confrontation scenes, he almost visibly flails for a handhold. You hear that great actors like Duvall can make less experienced actors rise to their level through the sheer force of their own talent, but that has not happened for Irvine. He is strictly one note. Red and Gally meander through Mexico as various bad guys close in on them, looking to get the money back. Along the way, they pick up a stripper named Patty Wafers (Angie Cepeda), a tough-talking girl who takes a shine to Red because he dances with her and makes her laugh. It is a testament to Cepeda's talent that she makes this work. She says to Gally later that Red \"saw me for me,\" even if it is not what is portrayed on screen at all. Red was leering at her just like every other guy in the joint. The only difference is that he's, you know, Robert Duvall. \"A Night in Old Mexico\" is so in love with Duvall that it doesn't do the necessary work to make any of this believable.

{"Title": "Spectre", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "James Bond films are, and always have been, more imitative than innovative. Even in the 1960s they were essentially superhero movies starring an indestructible character who wore street clothes (and the occasional wet suit) instead of tights and a cape. He ran, jumped, drove and flew through loosely connected setpieces that borrowed whatever cliches happened to be popular in action cinema at that moment and amped them up with more beautiful locations, bigger explosions, cornier jokes, and lush, loud music by John Barry. Given the franchise's lineage, it was only a matter of time before the producers went the extra kilometer and started modeling the Bond films on the Batman and Marvel franchises. The new superhero films featured fussy world-building and onion-layered subplots doled out over many films and many years. Their conception owed quite a bit to comic books and to serialized television like \"24\" (James Bond by way of \"Die Hard\"). The last three Bond films drew on all of those traditions, plus Bond's own distinctive set of cliches, and set the stage for this fourth Craig outing, \"Spectre.\"  Advertisement The second Craig Bond, \"Quantum of Solace,\" built a convoluted narrative \r\nscaffolding atop 2006's \r\n\"Casino Royale\"\u2014the best movie in the fifty-plus-year-old franchise, and the only one that would satisfy even if the main character were named Oswald Chutney. The final \r\nact of \"Royale\" killed off Bond's one true love, Vesper Lynd (Eva \r\nGreen), which set the stage for an emotionally burned-out, extra-icy \r\nBond investigating a global conspiracy in \"Solace\" that turned out to be\r\n connected to the bad guys he fought in \"Royale.\" \"Spectre\" \r\noccurs in the aftermath of MI-6's decimation in the last Bond picture. It \r\nretroactively forces connections between \"Royale,\" \"Solace\" and \r\n\"Skyfall,\" by way of a video-recorded warning sent to Bond by his old boss M (Judi \r\nDench) right before her death, urging Bond to follow the trail from \r\nMexico City to Italy to Morocco and beyond, and dig to the bottom of the \r\nconspiracy that claimed so many agents' lives. The movie feels \r\nlike a culmination of everything the franchise has been building toward \r\nsince Craig stepped into the part in \"Casino Royale.\" The\r\n most recent incarnation of Bond doesn't just have stunts and \r\nquips and gadgets and curvy women with porno names. Courtesy of \"Skyfall,\" it has a \r\nmythology that turns Bond into Batman minus the cape and cowl, and boasts a Bond version of Stately Wayne Manor; an Alfred-the-butler figure (Albert Finney in \r\n\"Skyfall\"); a tragic orphan back-story (repeated via the death of Dench's matriarchal figure, who's even called \"Mum\"), and\r\n a Joker-type bad guy (Javier Bardem's fey torturer).  If you loved all \r\nthat stuff, you'll adore \"Spectre,\" which revives the titular organization \r\nfrom the Sean Connery era Bond flicks. It has subplots, characters and incidents that amount to what genre fans would call \"ret-cons.\" And it introduces us to a new big bad, Franz Obenhauser (Christoph Waltz)\u2014aka Ernst Stavro Blofeld; please don't act surprised, neither of us were born yesterday! This new (old, really) villain makes \r\nBardem's character in \"Skyfall\" seem like a junior Joker at best, if that. He even lures Bond into a ruined building that he's transformed into a combination haunted house and gallery installation, and by the end, he acquires a scar whose gruesomeness rivals the Joker's mouth disfigurement.  Advertisement If \"Spectre\" were a great movie, or even a consistently good one, this might be wonderful, or at least intriguing. But this is a weirdly patchy, often listless picture. The Craig Bonds are so expensive and expansive that they can't help but impress with sheer scale. And every now and then they come up with bold images, like the silhouettes of Bond and a foe grappling in front of neon signage in \"Skyfall,\" and the overhead shot of Bond entering the bombed-out ruins of MI-6 headquarters in \"Spectre\" preceded by a shadow four times as long as he is tall. But an hour or two after you've seen \"Spectre\" the film starts evaporating from the mind, like \"Skyfall\" and \"Solace\" before it. It's filled with big sets, big stunts, and what ought to be big moments, but few of them land.\u00a0  What's the problem? Maybe it's the script. It's credited to a murderer's row of gun-for-hire writers, but it can't seem to come up with anything but undistinguished chases and fights and quips pasted together by exposition that's half baked even by Bond standards. Like Christopher Nolan's Batman, Bond shows up wherever he has to be and escapes certain death as needed, without a hint as to how he pulled it off. And even by Bond's damn-the-rules, full-speed-ahead standards, the character is such a suitcase nuke in a cable-knit sweater that it's hard to see him as England's (or the West's) disreputable protector, which is how you pretty much have to see Bond if you're going to root for him. (Omelets, eggs.) In the pre-credits sequence, Bond wreaks destruction on Mexico City, creating an international incident that gets him suspended for the umpteenth time; when he argues that the terrorists he was trying to foil would've caused more damage, he sounds like a parody of the sort of hero who would say such things. At least when Tom Cruise offers similar defenses the \"Mission: Impossible\" movies (the latest of which has a plot not hugely different from this one's, come to think of it) it's meant to be ludicrous and frothy, not freighted with righteous woe.\u00a0  Or maybe the problem is the production itself. The crew teams \"Skyfall\" director Sam Mendes with production designer Dennis Gassner and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (\"Interstellar\") and fills the screen with deserts and lakes and forests and mountains and historic skylines and converging perspective lines and tastefully arranged rectangles-within-squares and shallow planes of focus (the movie often seems to be in 3-D even though it's not), but too often ends up looking rather like a SuperBowl ad for cell phone service or cologne.  Advertisement Or maybe\u2014blasphemy alert\u2014the problem is Craig's performance. He might be the most drop-dead-serious actor\u00a0 to play Bond, and he probably comes closer than anyone to making the character seem plausibly human (Pierce Brosnan had his moments, even though the scripts were even less inclined to support his efforts than Craig's). But as the character has become increasingly opaque and recessive\u2014so much so that Mendes and company seem less interested in Bond as a cold but complex person than as a sculptural object to light and pose\u2014you may wonder what the point is. This Bond is a sinewy husk of a man, pursing his lips and staring into the middle distance. He's turned into the narrator of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\" but with a sidearm. The actor and the writers give us so little to grab onto that it's hard to sense Bond's feelings, much less feel with him. Late in \"Spectre,\" we're supposed to believe that Bond is truly attached to his love interest, Lea Seydoux's Madeleine Swann (nice double Proust reference there). She reciprocates the craggy killer's affection even though, as she rightly observes, she was living in hiding for years until Bond led the bad guys straight to her. But there's little in this film's writing of Bond, or in Craig's performance, to imply that the character is capable of investing in anything more emotionally fraught than a martini mixed with house vodka.\u00a0  Or perhaps the problem is historical fatigue. Even the better bits of \"Spectre,\" such as a close-quarters fistfight on a passenger train between Bond and a thick-necked henchman (Dave Bautista of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\"), and a mostly wordless, almost one-take stalking/assassination sequence set during a Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City, pale in comparison to their Bondian inspirations (respectively, \"From Russia with Love,\" and \"Live and Let Die\" by way of \"Octopussy\"). We've been assured by the producers that \"Spectre\" contains homages to every previous Bond picture. That's great if you go to films mainly for Easter egg-style trivia in the form of situations and props. But it's not so great if you're inclined to take the makers of these films at their word, and expect a Bond film like \"Casino Royale,\" something with more brains and nuance than the usual, as opposed to a film that purports to be that kind of movie but is content to posture and strut rather than doing the necessary dramatic spadework.  Whatever the explanation(s), \"Spectre\" is the third Bond film in a row to write conceptual and dramatic checks that the movie itself can't cash. We're at the point now where these films are consistently more fun to anticipate than they are to watch. The media campaigns tend to be more cunning and surprising than anything that ends up onscreen. This film won political correctness kudos for casting Monica Bellucci as Bond's first age-appropriate lover (she's two years older than Craig), but \"Spectre\" itself squanders her in two scenes, then ditches her for the 30-year old Seydoux. Blofeld's chief henchman is a bust, just a muscleman in a suit; he makes a memorably nasty entrance blinding a rival with his thumbs, but from then on, he's all sneers and punches and kicks. Blofeld fizzles, too. Waltz, who tends to give the same performance over and over with minor variations but at least has the decency to be a hoot each time, is in \"Spectre\" only slightly longer than Bellucci, and has been drained of the glee he displayed in Quentin Tarantino's films. The payoff of his character's storyline is so dumb that it makes the \"twist\" in \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" seem sensible and heartfelt. Stupider still is Bond's reaction when he finally gets the drop on his nemesis. Bags of Scrabble tiles make more sense. Advertisement Even the look of \"Spectre\" makes promises that the film won't keep. Between the copious mirror and reflection shots, the surveillance screens and wall-mounted cameras, and Waltz's all-seeing, all-knowing baddie, we're tacitly promised the first James Bond horror movie: a creepy Cubist study in voyeurism and fear, powered by nightmare logic and silhouettes and moments of physical violation; Bond by way of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" or Fritz Lang's Dr. Mabuse films. Beyond novelty, such an approach would have made the film's instances of slipshod plotting feel all-of-a-piece, like the \"because I said so\" storytelling in Nolan's Batman pictures.  But of course \"Spectre\" can't give us that, because Bond films are products before they're anything else, and products aren't allowed to challenge or upset people. If Mendes didn't keep finding original ways to stage unoriginal moments, this film's star rating would be lower than it is. Even by the generous standards of Bond pictures, which have been graded on a curve since 1962, \"Spectre\" has to be considered a missed opportunity.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Diary of a Teenage Girl", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Coming-of-age stories told from a girl's perspective tend to go a couple of predictable ways: A girl expresses her sexuality and disaster ensues, leading to promiscuity, drug use, pregnancy, hooking up under the freeway, etc. Or, the story focuses on the \"first love\" aspect, the explosion of intense emotions (and hormones), bathed in the lens flare of nostalgia. But what about a story where a girl explores her sexuality with enthusiasm (just like a boy would), and disaster does NOT ensue? Those stories are harder to come by, although they are out there. \"Diary of a Teenage Girl,\" from first-time writer/director Marielle Heller (based on the novel by Phoebe Gloeckner), is one of those stories. It's a refreshing, and, sadly, rare take on a girl coming into her own. Once Minnie (played by Bel Powley, in a major performance) discovers how great sex is, she wants more of it. Her choices are not always smart (she's only 15), her partner is wildly inappropriate for her (not to mention illegal), but Heller has spoken about how she wanted to allow for complexity. The result is a film that is funny and sad, scary and sweet, disturbing and revelatory.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Diary of a Teenage Girl\" starts with Minnie walking through the park with a triumphant smile on her face. She says in voiceover, \"I had sex today...Holy shit!\" She smiles at strangers, people picnicking, throwing a Frisbee around, and the whole world seems beautiful. It's San Francisco in the mid-1970s. The times are loose, the mood is wild. Minnie's mother (Kristen Wiig, in yet another performance that proves she can do anything) is bitter and narcissistic, raising two daughters alone, as she parties, does drugs, and cavorts through a laissez-faire relationship with Monroe (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd). Minnie, absorbing the seething adult sexuality around her, is curious about sex, and eggs Monroe on to take her virginity. Which he promptly does, with only token resistance.\u00a0 Here is where many viewers will put on the brakes. Monroe is in his 30s, involved with Minnie's mother, and Minnie is still a minor. But as the title suggests, this is a story told from Minnie's point of view. You could look at Minnie's pursuit of Monroe as a way of getting back at her mother, but Heller doesn't muddy up the waters with psychological explanations. It's enough to Minnie that Monroe is hot, he has a cool mustache, her hormones are raging, and Monroe doesn't turn her down when she comes on to him.\u00a0 There's a difference between portraying\u00a0behavior and endorsing\u00a0behavior, but often movies and filmmakers get caught up in crossfires of controversy and confusion. Did \"Wolf of Wall Street\" endorse misogyny or was it a portrayal of a world where misogyny ran rampant? Did \"Zero Dark Thirty\" endorse torture? Or was it a story told from within the community that did not question torture's use? When 2009's \"Observe and Report\" came out, a controversy ensued about one scene where Seth Rogen's character has sex with Anna Faris, who is so wasted she is clearly unable to consent. The scene is disturbing, but it ends with a huge laugh, and therein was the problem. Did \"Observe and Report\" endorse date rape then? Where you come down on this issue is dependent on a lot of different factors, personal taste, political/social opinions and your feelings on what role art should play in our culture. Some feel art needs to be inspirational or educational: Films have a responsibility to show the consequences of bad behavior. Films should portray the world as it should\u00a0be, not as it is. A film is dangerous if it does not point an arrow at bad behavior telegraphing \"Don't do this.\" There aren't any wrong answers, but the problem comes when the same set of criteria is used for all works of art. The purpose of the old ABC Afterschool Specials was to warn kids about the dangers that were out there. But are all films to be judged with the same set of rules? Context matters. \"Diary of a Teenage Girl\" is bound to stir up some controversy along these lines. Does it endorse a 35-year-old man sleeping with a 15-year-old? Shouldn't she or he be made to \"pay\" for it in order to show the wrong-ness of the situation? But that opening scene, showing Minnie strolling through the sunshine, smiling to herself, loving the world, sets the mood and tells us the film's attitude towards the story that is about to unfold. Advertisement In a less complex film, Monroe would be portrayed as a skeevy creep with no redeeming qualities. But Skarsg\u00e5rd, a tremendously appealing actor, destabilizes that by bringing a sweetness to Monroe, and an almost childlike dissatisfaction with his life, all of which gets focused on the eager Minnie who latches onto him like a barnacle. The relationship is, of course, hugely imbalanced, manipulative on both sides, and emotionally explosive. Monroe's behavior is, indeed, gross. For Minnie,\u00a0the revelation that someone desires her almost literally blows her mind.\u00a0 Heller and cinematographer Brandon Trost create a gauzy golden-ish look, calling to mind faded photo albums, the mustard-yellows and pale-denim-blues of that era. The period is suggested, rather than fetishized. The music is atmospheric as opposed to a ready-made soundtrack, tunes coming out of jukeboxes, off record players, Minnie and her best friend jumping on the bed screaming along to The Stooges and drooling over a poster of Iggy Pop. Minnie wants to be an artist, and is obsessed with the gigantic Amazon women populating the comics of Aline Kominsky-Crumb. Minnie dreams of clumping through the streets of San Francisco, towering over the buildings, a Crumb-comic come to life. Animated images unfurl around the action throughout the film: drawings come to life, little flowers burst into blossom around Minnie's head when she's happy, a sketch of Monroe starts to talk to her in a heartfelt way. The animation was done by the talented Sara Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir, and, similar to 2013's \"The Motel Life,\" helps evoke the overheated emotions and sometimes delusional mindset of the protagonist.\u00a0 \"Diary of a Teenage Girl\" unravels slightly in its final sequences, featuring a couple of tangents that don't pour into the overall focus of the rest of the film. For the most part, though, \"Diary of a Teenage Girl\" is true to itself and its intentions. The characters are not betrayed by the plot, and vice versa.\u00a0 There are other films that have looked at coming-of-age from the girl's side of things. William Inge's plays and screenplays in the 1950s, fraught with repressed desire and terror of being labeled a \"bad girl\", were all about that. \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" is in this realm, as are the films of Francois Ozon and C\u00e9line Sciamma. Nancy Savoca's \"Dogfight\" places the emotional and sexual journey of Rose (Lili Taylor) on equal footing with that of Birdlace (River Phoenix), thereby avoiding the tiresome and sentimental manic-pixie-dream-girl formula. \"Little Darlings,\" as silly as some of it was, took the sexual urges of teenage girls seriously, adding unpredictable elements of sharp poignancy. \"Little Darlings\" is kind to girls who want to have sex and to say that that is not usually the case is to understate the situation. When teenage girls exploring their sexuality and enjoying it (like boys do) is seen as radical, or disturbing, or gross, then there is an urgent need for films like \"Diary of a Teenage Girl.\"\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Exposed", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"I think I wanna be the kind of role model that brings\r\npeople back to the time before the fruit of knowledge was eaten,\" the\r\nnouveau-burlesque artist Julie Atlas Muz says at the very beginning of \"Exposed,\"\r\na documentary that manages to be jaw-droppingly provocative and genuinely\r\nendearing\u2014sometimes at alternating points, and by the end kind of all at once. \"Exposed\"\r\nportrays a number of artists, mostly New York based, working in burlesque, or\r\nrather a largely nouveau form of it. A form of performance art that takes a\r\nbunch of the ingredients and accoutrements of conventional burlesque and pushes\r\nthem much farther than you'd imagine. And the movie also constitutes something\r\nof a \"wanna bet?\" challenge to a viewer who believes he or she can\r\nimagine plenty.  Advertisement Directed by Beth B, who made a name for herself as a\r\npost-punk NYC DIY filmmaker in the early '80s, \"Exposed' begins as a kind\r\nof conventional talking head doc that eventually reveals the remarkable layers\r\nof its subjects while never really breaking out of its standard firm, which\r\neventually serves as a potential anchoring device for the viewer. Seeing a\r\ntight close-up of Mat Fraser, who has the rough-hewn handsomeness of a young\r\nMartin Amis type and a slightly plumy British accent to match, creates one\r\nimpression; when footage of his stage show reveals his tiny arms and\r\nflipper-like hands, there's a bit of a shock, and it's entirely deliberate I\r\nthink. Initially Beth B. shows us the \"normal;\" she then reveals the\r\ndifference; and then she spends the rest of the movie unifying the two,\r\nprovided the viewer is willing to go along for the ride.  Fraser's situation is the one that has the most immediate\r\nvisual impact, but all of the performers here are taking burlesque and\r\nultra-X-rated vaudeville as a vehicle to explore their own issues and concerns\r\nabout gender and identity. World Famous BOB and Rose Wood, for instance, are biologically\r\nfemale and male respectively, but the representations they create on stage, and\r\nhow these relate to their interactions in the \"real\" world, both past\r\nand present, are both complex and poignant. One of the subjects of the movie\r\ndefines burlesque as an \"immediate, honest, and sometimes brutal art form,\"\r\nand the shock tactics these performers incorporate into a context that had\r\nheretofore been defined as completely frivolous is not just a matter of spicing\r\nup \"entertainment\" but also pursuing self-realization. An upscale\r\ndrinking spot like The Glass Slipper becomes a conduit for activism when\r\ntransformed by these performers.  This all sounds pretty heavy, and no kidding, it is, but\r\nthere's a great deal of humor here. The movie is as fascinating as it is\r\nconcise\u2014its running time is only about 80 minutes\u2014and it is probably best\r\nexperienced as part of a larger event at which its subjects actually perform,\r\nwhich is how the movie's being marketed in part. Still. It ought to be said,\r\nmuch of what is depicted here is not for the easily shaken. If you associate \"burlesque\"\r\nexclusively with Natalie Wood's striptease scene in \"Gypsy,\" take a\r\nstep back.  Advertisement Throughout \"Exposed,\" you'll see a few people\r\nseeming to pull items out of places you wouldn't think to pull from. Genitalia\r\nis displayed, then tugged, pulled, smushed, smeared with lipstick, and much,\r\nmuch more. Imagine the notorious windshield-sex scene from \"The Counselor,\"\r\nonly shot from inside the car. Okay, matters do not get entirely that graphic,\r\nbut pretty close. You have been warned. If you think you're up for it, then go\r\nfor it; \"Exposed\" will take you to a realm you might not have known\r\neven existed.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Commuter", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Frustratingly not-quite-there from start to finish, the paranoia-soaked railroad thriller \"The Commuter\" is the latest installment in the unofficial \"Liam Neeson Late Winter Butt Kickers\" series. The LNLWBKs started in January 2009, with the surprise smash \"Taken,\" and continued with more \"Taken\" movies, plus three Neeson adventures by Jaume Collet-Serra, the director of this new one (\"Unknown,\"\u00a0\"Non-Stop\" and \"Run All Night\" were the others). They're a staple of our moviegoing diet by this point, nearly as ingrained in the seasonal calendar as the holidays themselves.  Like nearly every entry, this new one is worth seeing for the unfussy determination of Neeson, a couple of impressively choreographed action sequences (in particular a one-take, hand-to-hand fight that attempts to one-up the famous hammer sequence in \"Oldboy\"), and an intriguing premise that the filmmakers never manage to fully exploit. By \"worth seeing,\" I don't necessarily mean \"rush to the nearest theater, forsaking all else,\" but rather, \"if this comes on TV, you'll probably watch the whole thing, as long as you're not in a hurry to be somewhere.\" Who knows, it might even be ideal train viewing. The plot has all the hallmarks of a daydream that got obsessively worked-over for years during somebody's daily rides to and from work. Advertisement Neeson's character, Michael MacCauley, is a 60-year-old ex-cop turned insurance salesman who works in midtown Manhattan. His boss tells him that he's being fired right when he's about to begin his return trip home to see his wife (Elizabeth McGovern, who deserves better than this) and college-aged son (Dean-Charles Chapman) in Westchester, Long Island. Michael loses his phone in the train station due to a pickpocket he doesn't realize bumped him on purpose, then meets a mysterious stranger (Vera Farmiga) who tells him he has to locate a certan passenger on the commuter train before it arrives at its final stop and plant a tracking device on him/her, at which point that person will be killed. Michael will get $25,000 up front and another $75,000 upon completion of the mission\u2014enough to offset the economic havoc wrought by his firing, including the potential scuttling of a reverse-mortgage on the family home that would've paid for his son's college.  This is one of those moral conundrums that really only generates suspense if you believe that a\u00a0working class hero who radiates decency would condemn another person to death for $100,000. Nevertheless, Neeson goes the extra kilometer trying to sell us on the character's economic desperation as well as his macho pride (Michael couldn't bring himself to tell his wife and kids that he just got fired, so there's pressure to make this right immediately so he'll never have to spill the truth).  Director Collet-Serra, who did the mostly terrific shark thriller \"The Shallows\" and seems to have a knack for stripped-down, goal-directed action flicks, has clearly absorbed Alfred Hitchcock films where the action occurs on the boundary separating the real from the metaphorical or dreamlike. The kaleidoscope of humanity that Michael meets on the train is a touch of \"Rear Window,\" the arrangement between him and Farmiga's character is a faint echo of \"Strangers on a Train,\" and there's a hint of \"North by Northwest\" in the notion of a (mostly) ordinary New Yorker getting pulled into a conspiracy and struggling to regain control over his life. In the end, though, this is a tweedy suburban version of a confined-space action flick. Michael is on his own the whole time. Any allies he picks up along the way are temporary, and not all can be trusted.  The class-warfare, eat-the-rich messaging feels rather slapped-on, though, and the movie never gets close to generating the political framework it would have needed to to be taken seriously as a parable of this or that, as opposed to yet another movie where Liam Neeson beats people up. It should be assumed that there are no extraneous scenes in a film like this\u2014by which I mean that, if you meet Michael's ex-partner (Patrick Wilson) and their former supervisor (Sam Neill) early in the story, and get a couple of moments where Michael talks about the economic collapse of 2008, and a scene that ends with Michael giving the finger to a jerkbag of a stockbroker, and one where Michael looks up from a bar to see a TV news story about officials being arrested on corruption charges, you can bet it will all come together in the end, haphazardly. No one involved in the production seemed to think we'd care about clarity when it came to stuff like this. They weren't entirely wrong, but the articulation is still wanting: why even do this kind of politically allegorical action picture if you're not going to, y'know, really do it? Like, with feeling?  Advertisement I did care very much about Neeson's character, though, thanks mainly to his mastery of the same \"just say your lines and hit your marks\" style of film acting. No matter who he's playing in these movies, he always attacks the problem at hand with the low-key focus of a guy trying really hard to open a stuck jar of jam. It's my considered opinion that Neeson's late-career brand of business class dad machismo has yet to meet a director that can fully do it justice, but reasonable minds may differ. In any case, it's doubtful that any will be debating the fine points of his late-career filmography when Michael is hanging underneath a moving train like Indiana Jones, or breaking the little glass box at the end of a car so that he can use the hammer on someone's skull.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Wiener-Dog", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"You have to break a dog to break their will.\"\"What is a 'will,' exactly, anyway?\"\"It's character. It's the thing that makes you you.\"\u00a0If the \"will\" is the \"thing that makes you you,\" then breaking that will is tyrannical. Maybe a broken will is necessary to the social contract, as well as a part of the human condition, but there's hardly any comfort in that. Todd Solondz doesn't care about the audience's comfort and his films have a ruthless, unblinking stare, almost refreshing in their uncompromising attitude (especially in comparison with the industry's pathological desire for happy endings). Solondz rarely provides escape hatches. He presents reality, or reality as he sees it. Reality can be hilarious, absurd, touching. It can also be an exercise in futility. With all its humor (and there is a ton), \"Wiener-Dog,\" following the journey of a dachshund as it is shuffled from owner to owner, is one of Solondz's sharpest visions of futility. Advertisement Early on, there is a slow horizontal pan down a line of caged dogs, lit in the sickly-green of buzzing fluorescence. It is surreal and elegant, putting us into the world-view of the creature we will follow. Disorientation is almost total for the dog. Just a moment ago, the dog knew where it was, who its \"person\" was. Everything changed in an instant. Each owner of the dog is further along down life's path, and the dog is the witness to the passage of time. The owners flail in the void, searching for a handhold, something\u00a0to make life meaningful. Shot by Edward Lachman, two-time Oscar nominee (for \"Far From Heaven\" and \"Carol\"), \"Wiener-Dog\" enters and exits multiple worlds, following the dog's destiny. It starts in an ultra-cool modern house with no personal objects in sight, not even in the child's room. Remi (Keaton Nigel Cooke), a little boy with constantly bickering parents (Tracy Letts and Julie Delpy) is given the dog to comfort him after a serious illness. Neither parent is happy with this situation. (Dad is shown trying to train the dog, throwing vicious epithets its way). But Remi falls in love with the dog, naming it \"Wiener-Dog\" (the nickname of poor Dawn Wiener in Solondz's \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\"). When the dog gets spayed, Remi is concerned that she will be scared and in pain; when the dog gets sick, Remi asks questions about death. Delpy handles her son's anxieties in a mildly panicked and yet totally inappropriate way. \"We don't believe in God,\" she tells her son. \"Nature doesn't care about animals,\" she informs Remi. She relates the sad story of Croissant, her childhood dog who got pregnant (only she describes it as Croissant having been \"raped by a dog named Mohammad\"). Remi's love of his dog, and the rapturous scene where the two tear apart the living room in slo-mo, is an ecstatic moment of uncomplicated joy and freedom, the best that dogs (and children) can exemplify. The next owner is Dawn Wiener (all grown up from \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" and now played by Greta Gerwig). Dawn rescues the dog who is about to be put to sleep from a vet's office, cradling it in her arms. At a convenience store, she runs into Brandon, the boy she knew when she was a kid (played by Brendan Sexton in \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" and here played by Kieran Culkin), and they have a stilted reunion where it's clear that he can't wait to get away from her. When he tells her that she looks like her dog, her face lights up. Dawn is cheery, pliable, caring, and susceptible. Brandon is on his way somewhere, and she decides to come along with her dog, and suddenly \"Wiener-Dog\" becomes a road movie. There's a detached quality to Dawn (she sits on her bed, staring out the window, saying to herself simply: \"I miss nothing here.\") A person with no attachments, she floats, and Greta Gerwig is a great \"floater.\" Dawn is like Remi in that she sees the pain in others (in the bitter Mariachi band they pick up along the way, in the troubled Brandon). The sequence is not exactly a hopeful sequel to \"Welcome to the Dollhouse.\" If Wiener-Dog is just along for the ride, then so is Dawn. Advertisement Danny DeVito is heartbreaking in his role as Dave Schmerz, a one-time successful screenwriter, who now teaches a course at a film school, universally disliked by his young heartless students who think he's old and his advice worthless. Dave holds out hope he can sell his own script, but he can't get his agent on the horn. He is in trouble with the administration for not being supportive enough of his students who breeze into his office saying they want to merge queer theory with epistemological concepts in their films, and then look annoyed when he asks \"What is it about, though?\" The film-school section of \"Wiener-Dog\" goes meta, similar to what Solondz was up to in \"Storytelling,\" addressing the critiques of his own work as well as his contempt for those who refuse to engage. In the middle of all of this is an old-fashioned \"Intermission,\" showing the dachshund, now gigantic, strolling through Monument Valley, all to the crooning accompaniment of a Spaghetti-Western style song called \"The Ballad of the Wiener-Dog.\" It's a biting commentary on the audience's need for a \"break.\" Ellen Burstyn is the final owner of the dog. An invalid, hidden behind dark sunglasses, she tolerates the visit of her twitchy anxious granddaughter Zoe (Zosia Mamet), artist boyfriend named Fantasy (Michael James Shaw) in tow. Zoe is eager to please, on the edge of tears, babbling about Fantasy's art (\"I'm interested in mortality,\" announces Fantasy) and afraid of her formidable humorless grandmother (as well she should be). The scene, and the one that follows, is sweeping and surreal in its evocation of regret, loss, and roads not taken. Things happen in the film that are unbearable or gross (one example being the lengthy horizontal-pan of the dog's diarrhea trail), and Solondz lingers on it, forcing the audience to linger, too. His rage shimmers off the screen. At one point, Zoe says to her grandmother with desperate brightness, \"I'm still young!\" and Burstyn snaps, \"Don't kid yourself.\" That could be a summing-up of Solondz's outlook on life. It's not that there isn't humor in life. Or joy. There is. But don't kid yourself.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Quiet Ones", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "This site\u2019s founder, the great Roger Ebert, had a pretty good rule concerning screen comedy, to the effect that, if you laugh, the movie is doing its job. You\u2019ve got to show a little humility in the face of that. Hence, I can\u2019t front too hard over \"Home Alone,\" a movie that I have no admiration for in a lot of respects, because the first time I saw it, I laughed like a\r\ncaffeinated hyena. I guess the same thing ought to apply to horror movies. A new one, \"The Quiet Ones,\" a PG-13 offering from the revived banner of Hammer, the classic low-budget genre house of the U.K. in the \u201850s, \u201860s, and \u201870s, is not inordinately innovative: its themes of supernatural possession and the challenges of documenting otherworldly phenomena have been done to death, so to speak. The opening \"This Movie Is Based On Actual Events\" is as old as the hills, too. But I gotta tell ya: I had my fingers in front of my eyes about a half dozen times during this movie. Granted, I was at a late-night screening in a theater with maybe a dozen other people, some of whom could have conceivably been up to no good, so maybe the atmosphere helped. But if you look at a horror\r\nmovie\u2019s prime directive to be to scare the viewer, there\u2019s no denying that, at times, \"The Quiet Ones\" got me.  Advertisement I also admit that I was rather taken with its period trappings. The move begins at Oxford University in the early \u201870s, and stays there. An abnormal psych expert played by Jared Harris has been \u201cstudying\u201d a young woman whose psychoses could be demonic possession, or could be a\r\nscientifically explainable telekinetic disturbance that can be ejected from the woman and trapped in another vessel. \u201cCure one and you cure the world,\u201d the utopian prof promises. When the college suspends his funding, he takes his true believers\u2014a couple of attractive, game students, and a less refined young A/V hunk who\u2019s recording the treatment sessions on 16mm\u2014to a deserted manor, the better to isolate the characters as doors open and shut themselves and the\r\npower goes out and so on.  The movie\u2019s script, by director John Pogue, Oren Moverman (\"Rampart,\" \"The Messenger\") and Craig Rosenberg (adapting an earlier work by Tom DeVille) is a little more conspicuously intelligent than most, threading an intriguing sexual jealousy theme into the movie\u2019s narrative mix. That theme doesn\u2019t amount to much as the picture oozes to a mayhem-merry climax, but it ratchets up the tension nicely. The obligatory explanation for all the nastiness mixes \"The Exorcist\" with \"Peeping Tom\" in a way that the filmmakers don\u2019t satisfactorily exploit. And \"The Quiet Ones\"' fetishizing of vintage audio, film, and medical equipment recalls another recent British horror picture, \"Berberian Sound Studio.\" As I fetishize such stuff myself, perhaps that aspect of the movie skewed my sympathies as well. Bottom line, though: I squinted, I looked away, I sank in my seat, I shuddered. For this movie, that means \"Mission Accomplished.\"", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Journey", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "In 2004, two years before the St. Andrews Agreement, I visited a friend in Belfast. Changes were already apparent, if you knew what to look for. A Starbucks had opened, an encouraging sign that corporations were no longer shying away from a war zone. There were still echoes everywhere of the decades-long strife that had shattered the community. I took a \"black cab tour,\" and the guide pointed out a pub where a bomb had gone off in the past, adding, almost casually, \"My girlfriend's Da got his leg blown off there.\" It was such a clear example of the multi-generational aspect to The Troubles, to any civil war really, how grief and loss are passed down. Advertisement When Martin McGuinness died this past March, the tone of the obituaries spoke to the complexity of his legacy. The headlines were mostly variations of: \"From IRA Terrorist/Commander to Peacemaker.\" Or \"From Sinn F\u00e9in Leader to First Deputy Minister.\" The comments sections seethed with arguments. This was a man who started out as a kid throwing rocks at British soldiers, who ended up shaking hands with Queen Elizabeth, a surreal moment if ever there was one, as well as sharing political power with long-time rabblerouser Reverend Ian Paisley (the man who heckled Pope John Paul II in 1988 with the immortal words: \u201cI denounce you, Anti-Christ!\"). Paisley and McGuinness actually did become if not friends then allies in their roles as First Minister and deputy First Minister of the new power-sharing government, post the 2006 St. Andrews Agreement. \"The Journey,\" directed by Nick Hamm, written by Colin Bateman, announces at the outset, \"This story imagines that journey\" (\"that journey\" being how Paisley and McGuinness decided to bury the hatchet). It's a weird sentence and I got tripped up on it initially. Since the film is filled with real-life people (Gerry Adams, Tony Blair, Bertie Ahern, etc.), and since it takes place at a real-life event (the St. Andrews peace talks), veering off into a pretend-universe where Paisley and McGuinness are trapped together via circumstances beyond their control and HAVE to get along ... is a simplified grade-school version of political realities. It's \"The Odd Couple\" with Irish accents. There's a naivete at work in the concept: If only these men could bond about football, their wives, their kids ... if only these staunch enemies could see one another as people, then maybe the Catholics and Protestants will join hands in love and harmony! Did Ian Paisley (Timothy Spall) and Martin McGuinness (Colm Meaney), as the film shows, go on a bizarre little road trip where they were forced to listen, grow, change? Of course not. Unfortunately for the film, the real-life version of how these two mortal enemies became so close that they were referred to in the press as \"The Chuckle Brothers\" is way more interesting than the \"imagined\" version presented in the film. According to the film's imagined universe, in the middle of the peace talks, Ian Paisley had to fly back to Belfast for his Golden Anniversary wedding celebration. Martin McGuinness insists on accompanying Paisley. Tony Blair (Toby Stephens) and M15 chief Harry Patterson (the late John Hurt) are thrown into a panic. McGuinness and Paisley MUST have their emotional \"breakthrough\" during their hour-long car ride to the airport, otherwise there will never be peace in Northern Ireland. Their solution to this is to deck the car with hidden cameras, and provide the fake chauffeur with a Bluetooth (through which they whisper suggestions to get the two scowling adversaries talking). Patterson, Blair, and a taciturn Gerry Adams (Ian Beattie) watch the entire thing unfold over video monitors from a command post at St. Andrews, as though it's Mission Control in Houston. Advertisement Paisley sits in outraged silence for the first portion of the drive, while McGuinness tries to make conversation. Then a series of phony events\u2014a detour through a forest, a run-in with a deer, a confrontation at a gas station\u2014transforms the two men, and they finally start talking. McGuinness and Paisley argue over familiar territory: Bloody\u00a0Sunday, the Enniskillen bombing, the hunger strike. Their views are so diametrically opposed that they basically live in alternate realities. They have fights, which include cliched lines like: \"You are so defensive!\" \"Alright, walk away, walk away, that's what you do!\" The moments where McGuinness gets the icily reserved Paisley to crack a smile are sitcom-phony, at best, and it's made even more egregious by Tony Blair and Gerry Adams gasping with excitement from afar that the Emotional Healing has begun. In 2016, Spall played, back-to-back, two inflammatory and despised real-life men, Holocaust denier David Irving in \"Denial\" and now Paisley. Spall did so, in both cases, without pleading for any sympathy for the characters, suggesting the striations of fragility, narrowness, and rigidity in these men's emotional makeup. In \"Denial,\" he is vigorous, staunchly upright. In \"The Journey\" he is believably decrepit and frail. His hatred of the man in the car with him\u2014and all that that man represents\u2014is so believable that it makes his rock-hard refusal to open up to McGuinness' joking comments understandable. His voice is a dead ringer for Paisley's booming religious-harangue tones. (After the doomed Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, Paisley addressed a crowd of protesters in Belfast, screaming, famously, \"Margaret Thatcher tells us that that [the Irish] Republic should have some say in our province. We say NEVER! NEVER! NEVER! NEVER.\" Paisley's gigantic voice thunders \"Never\" over and over again in a kind of incantatory rhetoric, and Spall does not shy away from the intimidating size of Paisley's voice.) Meaney has a thankless role, the McGuinness of \"The Journey\" being the guy who has to persist in warming up Paisley, almost like a Life Coach, using his charm and humor. The final exchange between Paisley and McGuinness, when they shake hands, is the best, but by then it's far too late. The plot-manipulations and artificial events stage-managed by Mission Control back in St. Andrews all serve to diminish the peace talks, the importance of tough compromise, and the reality of what is actually required of politicians when they decide to sit down at a table such as that one.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Last Vegas", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "If you saw \"The Hangover\" and thought, \"I would enjoy this film more if nothing of consequence happened, and it were clean enough to screen at a retirement home,\" then \"Last Vegas\" is custom made for your needs.\u00a0Written by Dan Fogleman and directed by Jon Turtletaub (\"National Treasure\"), this tale of four old buddies reuniting in Las Vegas is what you might call \"low-impact\" comedy. There's really nothing to it except sentimental shtick. \u00a0 Billy (Michael Douglas), a millionaire notorious for resisting matrimony the way most people resist drinking lye, has finally decided to get hitched. His bride-to-be is 30 years old. You don't need to know her name or anything about her because the film isn't really interested in her. She's just the pretext to get the old gang back together.\u00a0Said gang includes Archie (Morgan Freeman), who recently suffered a mild stroke and is being micromanaged to prisonerhood by his well-meaning son; Sam (Kevin Kline), happily married but depressed by his loss of lust for life, and Paddy (Robert De Niro), a widower who sits at home all day moping and scowling, surrounded by pictures of his beloved. Paddy is the refusenik of the group, in theory\u2014he and Billy had a falling out over Billy's failure to attend Paddy's wife's funeral, and this incident is rooted in a deeper conflict that the film will explain and re-explain and re-re-explain, never with any grace. \u00a0 Advertisement What awaits the reunited gang in Las Vegas? Luxury. Great food. Swanky entertainment. If you think this sounds like a feature-length ad for a particular city, bingo. The film's geography-based product placement is over-the-top even by the standards of self-deprecating Hollywood piffle. The gang ends up staying at the Aria, the Aria, the Aria, did I mention the Aria? I must have. The logo seems as though it's in every other shot.\u00a0 The friends do what people do in Vegas when they'd rather not risk arrest or catch a disease: they gamble; they have nice meals; they walk around and take in the sights; they bicker, sometimes amusingly, sometimes tiresomely. Light and fluffy as it is, this elder fantasy could have been a minor classic had the script created four characters with convincingly detailed comic psychologies, but \"Last Vegas\" isn't interested in trying that hard. It offloads the burden of characterization onto its actors, and the Aria.\u00a0 Freeman plays a wily gentleman who seems milquetoast and beaten by life, but was suave once, and could be again. His character's early luck at the card tables sets up the film's voyage into vacation-wealth porn, the hub of which is a penthouse suite that an oil prince might find excessive. De Niro smiles so rarely these days that you'd think he got docked ten grand every time he showed his teeth, so naturally he's the snarling killjoy of the bunch; there are a few moments where he gets to puff up his chest or use his fists, like an aging gangster in a wannabe-Scorsese flick. (At one point he decks a bullying guest played by Jerry Ferrara, a.k.a. Turtle on \"Entourage.\" The resulting comic riff\u2014which finds their hotel escort, endearingly played by Romany Malco, convincing the deckee that the oldsters are scary East Coast mobsters\u2014is as funny as it is obvious.) Michael Douglas plays exactly the type of guy you'd expect Michael Douglas to play: casting him as a privileged, charming old rascal who's terrified of mortality is a slam-dunk by this point, like casting Bruce Willis as a haggard killer with regrets. Kudos to the script for teasing Douglas' mega-slick image, though: \"Your teeth, your hair, even your tan is phony,\" Paddy growls at him. \u00a0 Two actors elevate the film. One is Kevin Kline. His comparative leanness belies the notion that his character is worn out and worn down; like Freeman, De Niro and Douglas, he looks so fit for his age that you just have to take the script's word that he's succumbing to decrepitude. (There should be a word for fit older actors playing characters in decline. Maybe \"oldface.\") Nevertheless, you buy him, and the fact that Kline has no established persona to lean on makes his work here more impressive. His Sam\u2014who has rather improbably been given permission to cheat by his wife (Joanna Gleason), plus a rubber and an erectile dysfunction pill\u2014is sly as well as spry. Kline deftly underplays every scene and line, timing punchline moments so that you don't see them coming. He has an extraordinary scene late in the picture that I won't describe, except to say that it's terribly written, that it starts out unsavory and then takes a sharp right turn into ridiculousness, and that there are maybe five living actors who could make you believe it, and Kline is one of them. \u00a0 Advertisement The other standout is Mary Steenburgen as the independent businesswoman-turned-lounge singer character, Diana. She's the Manic Pixie Dream Dame, reawakening the slumbering youthful spirit in older suitors despite being very close to their age and making no apologies for it. Steenburgen is introduced in a cocktail lounge doing her own singing\u2014she's excellent\u2014and she quickly matches Kline in the scene-stealing department, bantering affectionately with De Niro's earthbound working-class guy and Douglas' Mr. Moneybags. \"You're not as charming as you think you are,\" she tells him, with a sing-song delivery that turns an insult into a dare. It's a shame that \"Last Vegas\" didn't give Diana more screen time\u2014it would have been nice to hear a woman's version of the anxieties afflicting our four grey-haired dudebros, or get a sense of her personality apart from her function in the Diana-Paddy-Billy triangle\u2014but she's still a kick. You never see a 60-year-old female movie character who's desirable not despite her maturity, but because of it.\u00a0 There are a few sharp old-guys-still-got-it jokes, including a priceless bit involving rapper 50 Cent as the gang's neighbor in the Aria, the Aria, the Aria, I say the Aria. There are many more corny or clumsily staged bits, and a few that verge on mortifying (including a scene in which the heroes judge a bikini contest emceed by\u00a0LMFAO member RedFoo, who gives De Niro a lap dance). \u00a0The picture begins vanishing from the memory the instant that its final credits roll, and \u00a0everyone involved is probably fine with that. \"Last Vegas\" is ninety minutes of scenery with a few bright moments, starring actors you like, plus the Aria.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "India's Daughter", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"India's Daughter\" begins with an account an atrocity. On a December evening in 2012, 23-year-old medical student Jyoti Singh was attacked along with her boyfriend while taking a bus home from seeing \"Life of Pi\" in Dehli, the nation's capital. She was gang raped on the bus and then thrown from it afterward, discarded like a broken doll. Authorities later said that her determination to resist angered her attackers further. A surgeon with twenty years experience who examined Singh afterward said that she \"looked like a cow looks after giving birth to a calf,\" and that \"the system by which the human body functions [was] all gone. We did not know which parts to join.\"  Advertisement The rape plunged India into chaos and exposed the patriarchal oppression that had shaped relationships between men and women as long as anyone could remember. Rape as punishment, rape as recreation, rape as means of social control, all came under public scrutiny, along with the tendency to excuse or explain the behavior of rapists (and bystanders who did nothing to stop stranger rapes or gang rapes) by transferring shame onto the victims.  Witnesses and experts in this film by producer-director Leslee Udwin talk about the surge of anger that tore through complacency in the days that followed, but the imagery of protests, and police brutality against protesters, is so powerful that the verbal descriptions can't do much more than put an intellectual frame around it. The sight of armored and armed male police officers using barricades and water cannons to prevent women from speaking out about rape says all that needs to be said about whose side the government was really on. It also shoots down the more retrograde statements by some of the male authorities in the film, one of whom likens a woman's virtue to a flower that should be placed in a temple rather than a gutter, by way of explaining why raped women are shunned. \"India's Daughter\" is a relatively brief film, clocking in at a little over an hour, the bare minimum necessary to be classified as a feature film as opposed to a short. There is nothing remarkable about it in terms of cinematic form, though it's questionable whether more emphasis on the means of storytelling would have enhanced or cheapened the story itself; with such innately powerful material (including interviews with the victim's parents, and two of the rapists) sometimes it's better to simply organize the material in a coherent manner and try to stay out of its way whenever possible. And that's what Udwin has done here, for the most part. Although the film is careful not to sensationalize an already appalling crime further by dwelling too long on physical details, it never seems to be skipping over anything or looking away from anything.  The final section is surprising and remarkable. It refuses to demonize the perpetrators and instead sees them as evidence of a toxic culture of handed-down masculine conditioning, as well as a society that doesn't how to employ or educate many of its poor young men. \"India's Daughter\" is a sorrowful and angry movie, yet measured. It seems determined to see a bigger picture without letting one victim's story get lost in the canvas.", "Critic": "Delta"}

{"Title": "Back in the Day", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Failed actor Jim Owens (Michael Rosenbaum, writer, director and star of \"Back In the Day\") returns home to Indiana for his 20-year high school reunion, and during a walk through a mall with his high school sweetheart Lori (Morena Baccarin), remarks happily, \"I love it when things don't change.\" While this may be a realistic comment from the nostalgic outsider who returns home, it's also emblematic of one of the biggest problems of \"Back in the Day\", where 20 years have passed since high school and nothing has changed. Nobody has made new friends, they all still hang out with each other, nobody seems to have jobs that take up much of their time, and adolescent hijinx are still seen as fun. Rosenbaum fills the film with every high-school-movie clich\u00e9 in the book, referencing \"Sixteen Candles\" at one point, and drenching the soundtrack in nostalgic hits from the '80s and '90s. Nostalgia needs to be grounded in something real, something true, in order for it to have any resonance. Otherwise, you're just left with a formula that was tired 20 years ago.  Advertisement Jim's only regular gig after 20 years in show business is as the spokesman for All City Insurance. His face smiles out from the sides of busses and benches. He dates women who are too young for him. He looks back longingly on the days of his youth, where, apparently, stealing your buddy's clothes and letting him run naked through a public park was the high-point of friendship. He decides to fly back for his reunion. Amazingly, his three best friends from high school, Len (Kristoffer Polaha), Skunk (Harland Williams), and T (Isaiah Mustafa), are all available to pick him up at the airport.  Len, Skunk, and T are all married, and their wives are nags, scolds, or mousy women who turn into Kinky Monsters in the sack. The guys go out for drinks, throw around homophobic barbs as jokes, and run into Angie (Liz Carey) who was a cheerleader in high school and is now pregnant with her fourth child (fathers unknown). Her pregnancy doesn't stop her from smoking, downing shots and hitting on all of the guys at the table. She is treated as grotesque by everyone in the film. Meanwhile, Jim runs into the aforementioned high school sweetheart Lori, who is now engaged to a guy named Mark (played by Jay R. Ferguson, aka Stan on \"Mad Men\"). Mark, turns out, was responsible for injuring Jim during a crucial football game back in the day. Lori is getting married the following week, and yet Jim still starts to make the moves on her, even though she appears to be happy with Mark.  Things follow as you would imagine. The four guys bond by hanging out in the parking lot of the local Pizza King, stripping their friend down naked while he's wasted and egging the house of the still-hated principal. No wonder their wives are annoyed. The film is pretty gross, featuring vomit, fecal matter, and multiple farts in almost every scene. The assistant principal turns out to be the gay lover of the principal, and you know how we know he's gay? Because he shows up at the door of the egged house, and he's actually holding a little yappy dog. Haven't we moved past the days of \"St. Elmo's Fire\", when the one gay character is shown swishing through the hallway holding a girlie drink with a colored umbrella in it? Even more disturbing, in \"Back in the Day\", the fact that the principal turns out to be a gay man is supposed to make us see him as ludicrous and worthy of mockery. The four guys are always joking about having anal sex or raping each other. They live in terror of penetration. I get that this is sometimes how guys talk, but it's not treated honestly here. It's an unexamined clich\u00e9 of male bonding. It's lazy.  Advertisement Turns out, Mark isn't so bad after all. He refuses to sleep with the half-naked stripper at his bachelor party because he doesn't want to be unfaithful. At night, Lori and Jim lie in the grass of the football field where they lost their virginity to one another, flirting and talking about high school. Which was 20 years ago, kids.\u00a0 The film is shot in a pretty stock manner, with jokes falling flat (when one does land, it feels like a miracle) and musical cues guiding us toward appropriate emotional responses. There is one funny scene with a competitive whiffle ball game shown in urgent slo-mo, as though it is a re-cap from the World Cup, but it doesn't even begin to lighten the mood.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The One I Love", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The set-up of \"The One I Love,\" Charlie McDowell's directorial debut,  starring Mark Duplass and Elizabeth Moss, is filled with tremendous  possibilities, all of which are explored throughout the film. The  set-up, reminiscent of some of Hitchcock's films, works like a  well-oiled stopwatch: once the situation starts, it cannot be stopped.  The film unfolds with a sense of inevitability, and while the events are  odd, they never lose their logic. There's a reason \"The Twilight Zone\"  is referenced in Justin Lader's script. \"The One I Love\" is a romance  and a mystery and a drama, with really only two characters in it,  characters who are sketches approximating human beings, but played with  sadness and humor by the two lead actors. Not knowing the \"twist\" going  in was part of the film's pleasure, and it's enough to say that nothing  is what it seems. Advertisement Ethan (Duplass) and Sophie (Moss) are in marriage counseling for a  variety of commonplace reasons: he cheated on her, they don't  communicate well, they don't have sex anymore. They mourn their former  \"irreverent\" selves, the selves who \"did ecstasy at Lollapalooza.\"  (That's as wild as they got.) Their relationship now consists of trying  to re-capture the happiness they had in the past, with predictably  hollow results. The marriage counselor (Ted Danson) suggests that they  go on a \"retreat\" for the weekend. He has sent many couples to this  place and they have all come back refreshed and renewed. Ethan and  Sophie figure they have nothing to lose. The \"retreat\" is a weekend alone in a big old house on a large property,  complete with a pool and guest house. There are no other guests. There is  no guru leading them through trust exercises. There is no Steve Carell  in \"Hope Springs.\" It is just Ethan and Sophie, hanging out, exploring  the grounds. Cinematographer Doug Emmett fills the screen with dark gloomy shadows,  and strange points-of-view, the two characters seen through a doorjamb  from an adjacent room, or through the windows from outside. These  touches give a creepy horror-movie perspective to the point of view. Is  something lurking out there for them? Are they being watched? Even the  early marriage counseling scenes are filled with stark noir shadows on  the wall and odd ominous angles. The commonplaces of Ethan and Sophie's  boring marriage are made strange, eerie, in how they are filmed. On their retreat, alone in the big house, Ethan and Sophie make dinner.  They drink wine and smoke pot. They loosen up. The dynamic between  Duplass and Moss has been tense and sad, and so their laughter brings  with it relief, release, a sense that they are beginning to remember why  they got together in the first place. That night, they crash in the  guest house and have sex. But when Sophie mentions it to Ethan the next  morning, he has no memory of it. Was he really that wasted? Strange things keep happening, and these strange things seem to be  emanating from the guest house. Ethan and Sophie, freaked out, flee the  property, but then are drawn back, thinking maybe that their marriage  counselor is on to something, that whatever this is, it is something they  need to explore. Remember when they used to be open to new things? Advertisement But what they open themselves to is a Hall of Mirrors, increasingly  disturbing, and the secrets start to pile up again, casually at first,  and then consciously and deliberately. The entire film rests on the  chemistry between Duplass and Moss. Except for the counselor, there are  no other people in it. The two actors create a very real relationship,  with a sense of shared joy in one another's company, and myriad problems  threatening to derail the entire thing. We can see how bored they are  with life, with themselves, and with each other. To Ethan, trying  something new means \"going horseback riding with a satchel of wine.\"  Ethan and Sophie are not extraordinary characters. But the situation in  which they find themselves in is. Unabashedly entertaining at an efficient 91-minutes, \"The One I Love\" is  an extremely confident first feature, with some really fun things to  say about identity and relationship, connection and destiny.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Wind Rises", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "73-year-old animator Hayao Miyazaki has announced that \"The Wind Rises\", his latest film, nominated for an Academy Award, will be his last. It's sad news. Audiences have flocked to see his beautifully imagined and lushly magical films since \"Princess Mononoke,\" his first international hit in 1997, and the worlds he has given us, the colors and sights and sounds, the plots and characters, create a powerful legacy. In \"The Wind Rises,\" the fictionalized story of Jiro Horikoshi, Japan's World War II airplane designer (he was responsible for designing the lethal \"Zero\" fighter plane), one character says, staring up at the racing clouds in the sky, \"Airplanes are beautiful dreams.\" Miyazaki's films are beautiful dreams, too. His presence is already missed.  Advertisement Young Jiro Horikoshi is a nearsighted boy who has fantastical dreams of flying airplanes, swooping above the green fields of his country, the landscape unfurling below him like a magical land of possibility. Being a pilot is closed to him due to his eyesight, but he decides to go to school to be an engineer and design those \"beautiful dreams\" for others to fly. Through this endeavor, he is encouraged by an Italian aircraft pioneer, a Count Caproni, who is a muse-like character appearing to him in dreams, showing him the glorious possibilities of flight and the gigantic flying machines he has built, giving the young Japanese boy a sense of how far one can go in one's imagination. The dream has to come first. The reality will then follow. This is how it has always gone with those who push technology forward.  Jiro's quest is single-minded, but not so much so that he does not notice the upheaval in the world around him. Jiro mourns that Japan is \"backward,\" they are 10, 20 years behind the rest of the world, they still need to use oxen to pull the aircraft out into the fields for a test run. They make their planes out of wood, not metal. How could they ever compete with the technological powerhouses of the world, like America or Germany? Additionally, there is political and economic unrest, desperate peasants swarming towards trains passing through, throngs of people flocking to the cities looking for work. After getting a job with Mitsubishi, Jiro is sent to Germany as a delegate, to learn about their airplane technology, to get tips and ideas to bring back home to Japan.  All of this takes place in the 1920s and 1930s, as the world arms up for war. \"The Wind Rises\" is a mild anti-war film (in an early scene, when Jiro beats up a school bully, his mother scolds him saying, \"Fighting is never justified.\"), perhaps too mild, considering its topic. But Miyazaki sticks close to Jiro's journey, following him through his dreams, his schooling, his investigative trips to Germany, and his sweet courtship of the girl Naoko, who will become his wife. Still, with all of that, \"The Wind Rises\" has an uneasy undercurrent about what these \"beautiful dreams\" will become when used in warfare. Planes then turn into nightmares, raining death down on the people below.  Advertisement In Jiro's dreams, the sky is filled with airplanes, swooping and colorful, like big fanciful paper birds, or benevolent bright dragons, harmless and buoyant. As the film moves on, and as Mitsubishi competes for contracts with the army and navy, he realizes that what he is doing is designing a killing machine. There were many like him in his generation of early aviators and airplane engineers. Man had dreamt of being airborne for centuries. To defy gravity, to soar through the air\u2014what an example of what humanity can do if it just dreams big enough! When Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927 and landed successfully in France, former Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes commented on the event: \"We measure heroes as we do ships, by their displacement. Colonel Lindbergh has displaced everything.\" The hopeful possibilities of flight soon descended into the horror of World War II, where airplanes played such a ferocious role. Many who designed those planes had moral qualms about what they had helped unleash.  \"The Wind Rises\" portrays these moral qualms, when Jiro's dreams suddenly turn dark and ominous, when the pretty swooping biplanes suddenly morph into threatening heaving monsters bursting down through the turbulent clouds. Jiro's problems are technological in nature, and \"The Wind Rises\", similar to \"The Aviator\", patiently takes us through his various breakthroughs in construction and design (he gets an inspiration for curved wings from looking at a mackerel bone). The Zero fighter plane, which put Japan on the map in World War II, was a long-range aircraft with a high degree of maneuverability. By the end of the war, technology had developed so quickly that the Zero was left in the dust by other fighter planes, and Japan resorted to using the Zero mainly in kamikaze operations. The film has been criticized for glorifying the deadly Zero, for glorifying Horikoshi and whitewashing some of the more problematic elements of his career. You could certainly make that case, and the soft-pedaling of what the Zero actually did in the war, and how it was used, is the only weakness in the film.  Jiro is treated with nostalgia and respect, and is a character you come to love, with his pink suit and unruly hair. His love story is touching and terrible, sweet and funny, and during a walk in a torrential downpour, struggling under an umbrella together, Naoko says to him, suddenly, \"Life is wonderful, isn't it?\" You may wonder how she can say that, especially since she suffers from tuberculosis. But she cannot help but look around and see things like rainbows, and waving trees, and see how good it all is. In her first conversation with Jiro, she quotes to him a line from a poem by Paul Val\u00e9ry:\"The wind is rising.We must try to live.\"  Advertisement Wind is in every scene, both figuratively and literally. The winds of war are already blowing at the beginning, and so are the winds of change. Japan must \"catch up\" to the rest of the world, and Jiro is part of that push. Wind also represents the breath of life, the breath caught in Naoko's TB-infected lungs, but as long as breath exists, there is hope. Wind races across a pond causing ripples, it rips umbrellas out of people's hands, it pushes against an airplane's curved wings, helping it to stay airborne. Wind is both benign and ominous.  The images in \"The Wind Rises\" are breathtaking, with one striking scene after another, imaginative, whimsical, powerful. There are a couple of magnificent sequences, one being the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, the most powerful earthquake in Japanese history at that time. It devastated Tokyo and the surrounding areas, and the fires that erupted following the quake turned into a raging firestorm, which leveled miles of the city. The scene unfolds in an eerie and terrible way, the ground buckling and cracking, houses sinking into the depths, power lines sparking as they topple over. The landscapes are suffused with poetry and beauty that almost aches, and the cloudscapes are like an undulating Maxfield Parrish sky, the sunset-lit clouds rearing up into mountains with planes swooping around the peaks.  In \"The Wind Rises\", we are given a portrait of a bespectacled thinker and dreamer, a boy obsessed with the inner workings of machines, and the way things are put together, a boy who looks around him and understands that what he fantasizes about can become a reality. The same could be said for Hayao Miyazaki, and in a way, \"The Wind Rises\" is his most personal film.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Guardians of the Galaxy", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "You wouldn\u2019t know it to look at me now, but there was once a\r\ntime when I had quite a bit of expertise in the Marvel Universe. I came as\r\nclose to tearing up while reading a comic book as I\u2019ll ever do when the Scarlet\r\nWitch finally married The Vision\u00ad\u2014as eloquent an argument for marriage equality\r\nas genre fiction has ever essayed, by the way. I did, I must admit, check out\r\nwell before the entity called The Guardians of the Galaxy turned up in said\r\nuniverse. I bring this up because there are some MU characters in the movie \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" that I did recognize\u2014super-evil demigod Thanos, Drax\r\nThe Destroyer, and one or two others I guess\u2014but I ultimately found that it was\r\nthat particular continuity, the need to tie this movie\u2019s adventures into\r\nsomething larger, that made the movie lag a bit.  Advertisement In many respects, \u201cGuardians,\u201d directed and co-written by\r\nindie wit James Gunn, and starring buffed-up former schlub Chris Pratt and\r\nReally Big Sci-Fi Blockbuster vet Zoe Saldana (here dyed green as opposed to\r\nher \"Avatar\" blue), is a fun and relatively fresh space Western. Think \u201cFirefly\u201d pitched at 15-year-olds, with a lot of overt \"Star Wars\" nods. And super-\u201cirreverent\u201d\r\ndialogue that is, more often than not, genuinely funny. The wisecracking by the\r\ncharacters played by Pratt (a kind of junior Han Solo) and voiced by Bradley\r\nCooper (whose Rocket Raccoon, who is, yes, a genetically altered raccoon) is so\r\nincessant viewers of a certain age might wonder whether this movie has been put\r\nthrough the \"What\u2019s Up Tiger Lily\" dialogue-replacement treatment before\r\nrelease.  Pratt\u2019s self-styled \u201cStarlord\u201d and Rocket are not the strangest of\r\ninitially inadvertent teammates in this intergalactic posse. Saldana\u2019s Gamora\r\nis a stealthy warrior princess who\u2019s been lying low in an evil family before\r\nrevealing her good intentions; wrestling star Dave Bautista\u2019s Drax is a\r\nvengeance-driven behemoth whose florid language only briefly masks his\r\ninability to take anything other than literally; and Rocky\u2019s \u201cmuscle,\u201d Groot, is a walking,\r\nminimally talking tree. These guys are entertainingly motley, which makes the\r\nfact that their mission, to save the universe from a mass-murdering\r\nmegalomaniac who seeks an item which will grant him unimaginable mass-murdering\r\npower (yes, more mass-murdering power than he ever had before), is generic in a\r\nway that\u2019s pretty consistent with movies of this sort.  You may have noticed, incidentally, that a lot of film\r\ncritics tend to get kind of defensive when reviewing movies based on comic\r\nbooks. Like, you probably noticed that up top I tried to claim some comic\r\nbook-respecting bonafides. I\u2019ve done this thing before when reviewing\r\ncomic-book movies. Some day, I may have to actually bring out the big guns,\r\nlike the fact that I used to be palsy with Mike Kaluta, or that I once went to\r\na Halloween party at Berni Wrightson\u2019s house. I don\u2019t do this because I\u2019m afraid\r\nof getting death threats from easily irritated comic book fans (which hasn\u2019t\r\nhappened to me, and thanks). I do it because as someone who got a lot out of\r\ncomics growing up, and still has a healthy respect for the graphic form, I find\r\ncomic book movies kind of frustrating, and am bent out of shape by having my\r\nfrustration chalked up to a lack of understanding of the form.  Advertisement What does this\r\nhave to do with \u201cGuardians?\u201d It ties into what I mentioned before. While this\r\nmovie is pretty lively in a lot of its particulars, the stilted portent with\r\nwhich its villains\u2014the bumpy-jawed Thanos (Josh Brolin, not that you can tell)\r\nand the megalomaniacal Ronan (Lee Pace)\u2014make themselves felt is pretty tired.\r\nThe \u201cfunny animal\u201d tribute/homages of \u201cGuardians\u201d bump up uncomfortably against\r\nthe faux-majesty of the bad guys in a way that the actual comic-book form is\r\nmalleable enough to at least sidestep. I think Gunn knows it, too: one of the\r\nmovie\u2019s only genuinely subversive jokes sees one of the heroes actually yawning\r\nin the pro-forma slow-motion \u201cwalk to destiny\u201d shot that heralds the movie\u2019s\r\nclimax. Which climax is, as is also pro forma, big and loud and filled with\r\nindiscriminate destruction and slaughter of sentient beings. But as it takes\r\nplace on a planet other than the one the audience is on and so doesn\u2019t involve\r\nthe razing of a recognizable city, it\u2019s a little less troubling than it might\r\nhave been.  It seems as if I\u2019m listing a lot of not-fun things in what I\u2019ve\r\ncalled a fun movie, but again, I\u2019m just voicing some frustration because, in my\r\npuny mind\u2014which can only imagine the extent to which Gunn and his team had to\r\nfight for every bit of creative license they were allowed\u2014the not-fun parts\r\nseemed entirely avoidable. What will win the day among those not given to overthinking\r\nwill be the charm of the cast\u2014which also includes Benicio Del Toro in a bit\r\nrole that allows him to exercise a generous amount of his legendary performing\r\neccentricity, and Michael Rooker in a gruff part that would have gone to Ron\r\nPerlman had Guillermo Del Toro directed the movie\u2014the sunniness of its eventual\r\noptimism, and the infectiousness of its vintage-Earth-pop soundtrack. A\r\nsoundtrack the film\u2019s characters appreciate as much as the audience will, which\r\nis part of the whole point.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Alex of Venice", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "An affectionate cinematic paean to a form of West Coast\r\nbohemia that could well be on its last legs, \u201cAlex of Venice,\u201d directed by\r\nyoung actor Chris Messina (best known for a recurring role on \u201cThe Mindy\r\nProject\u201d) and featuring an impeccable-as-usual lead performance from Mary\r\nElizabeth Winstead, is likely to appeal more to viewers who have some previously\r\nexisting allegiance to/affinity with its cast or its milieu than those who\r\ndon\u2019t.  Winstead plays the title character, an attorney who works\r\nfor an environmental activism group, and she\u2019s very good at her job and very\r\ndevoted to it. Her home arrangement is rather unusual: she lives in a great\r\nramshackle house with her partner George (Messina), their young son Dakota\r\n(Skylar Gaertner), and Alex\u2019s dad Roger (Don Johnson), a one-time TV star who\u2019s\r\nquick with an encroaching-old-age-defying inappropriate remark. The cooking,\r\nthe cleaning, the looking-after-the-kid, not to mention keeping track of\r\nincreasingly inattentive Roger\u2019s appointments, has finally gotten to be too\r\nmuch for George, and the failed house-husband bails. Alex is left to handle an\r\nimportant case involving a tadpole-destroying spa development supervised by\r\nslick but not uncaring entrepreneur (Derek Luke) and tend to her withdrawn son\r\nand manage her motley household all by her lonesome. Roger, who gets brought\r\ndown a peg at a theater audition by being asked to audition for the oldest role\r\nin \u201cThe Cherry Orchard\u201d rather than the younger one he started reading for,\r\ncalls the cavalry in the form of Alex\u2019s wild-child sister Lily (Katie Nehra,\r\nwho wrote the script with Jessica Goldberg and Justin Shilton). Lily\u2019s just as\r\nsalty-mouthed as dad but a bit more of a help, and she of course is the trigger\r\nwoman for the \u201cyou are going to have sex tonight\u201d scene that\u2019s become\r\nobligatory in low-budget character-driven American films in which an attractive\r\nfemale lead is dumped early on in the diegesis.  Advertisement If you think I\u2019m saying the movie is a tad predictable, I\r\nam. Additionally, I found it a little pat. Film people like to quote the late\r\ngreat director Jean Renoir, an adage about how the truly terrible thing in this\r\nworld is that everyone has their reasons; Renoir the man didn\u2019t actually say\r\nthat, a character he played and wrote in \u201cRules of the Game\u201d said it, but never\r\nmind; in any event, it always springs to mind when I see a movie such as this,\r\nwhich goes out of its way to be very scrupulous in not making villains out of\r\nany of its characters. \u201cAlex of Venice\u201d is a pleasant sit; it only rarely\r\ndisturbs one\u2019s precious bodily fluids with an irritating non-observation (Alex\r\nprotests at one point that she doesn\u2019t know how to grill a steak, and this is\r\nlater confirmed, albeit in a way that suggests she couldn\u2019t even try to\r\nextrapolate how raw meat interacts with fire), but it\u2019s so even-tempered that a\r\ncrankier viewer than myself might accuse it of slathering bland compassion on\r\nits characters like California sunshine pouring through a very\r\ntastefully-opened aperture. Or of over-indulging a variation of indie-pop\r\nhumanism/compassion that had long curdled into clich\u00e9.\u00a0 Messina\u2019s fondness for a\r\nbouncily mobile camera, happily taking in all the all-too-human interaction,\r\nincreases the feeling of forced likeability. But the film isn\u2019t completely\r\nclueless about how to use its assets. Winstead is entirely attractive and\r\nterrifically alert and alive throughout. The whole business with \u201cThe Cherry\r\nOrchard,\u201d which seems a trifle know-somethingish at first, pays off with a\r\nreally lovely climactic scene, which the ever-underrated Johnson brings home\r\nwith a grace that\u2019s both sly and warm-hearted. And the movie\u2019s quirky setting\r\npays off dividends where you least expect them. At such moments, the movie\u2019s\r\nhumanism finally seems unforced, and everything is the better for that.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The BFG", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"The BFG\" remembers what it's like to see \r\nwith the eyes of a child. The ideal age for it is somewhere between five\r\n and nine\u2014a time when kids \r\nask basic, very practical questions about the stories adults tell them at bedtime, like \"Are Sophie's glasses OK?\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill) is the heroine of \"The BFG,\" Steven Spielberg's film of Roald Dahl's novel. It's about a London orphan who gets kidnapped by The Big Friendly Giant, or BFG (Mark Rylance, in the first motion-capture performance to equal Andy Serkis' best) and whisked away to the land of the giants. The BFG is indeed friendly\u2014befuddled and a bit sad, but nice. But there are other giants here. They're scary, stupid bullies, and so big that they tower over the BFG the way he towers over Sophie. They love to eat people, whom they call \"human beans,\" or simply \"beans.\" When Sophie hides from the bigger giants and they clomp around looking for her, the first thing the BFG does is find Sophie's glasses and hide them in his pocket. He does it so that the bigger giants won't see them and know for sure that he's hiding a child, but there's a more basic motivation: to prevent them from getting crushed. \"Do you have my glasses?\" she asks him late in the film, during another action scene. \"Of course,\" he says. Advertisement The movie is filled with gestures that meaningful. Like the BFG, it cares about the little things, and it moves with a grace that belies its size. It's a film about about dreaming and storytelling, parenting and childhood, nostalgia and pragmatism, and the necessity of standing up for yourself even when you know you can't win. But most of all, it's a film about two unlikely friends.  There's a little bit of plot, mostly having to do with how the BFG will deal with the really big giants who scare him and call him \"runt\"; this stuff resolves itself so quickly that it's as if the story realized it was getting late and the kids needed to get to sleep. The movie is less interested in twists and turns than in watching the giant and Sophie interact. It's the kind of film that pauses to let characters tell each other stories and that recounts a dream by throwing shadows upon a wall. There are fart jokes, but unlike most movie fart jokes, they're not crudely desperate. They're joyously strange in that Roald Dahl way, and they don't just happen when a scene needs, well, gas; the movie builds toward them patiently, the better to keep kids on the edge of their chairs waiting for that first flap-flap sound.  I can imagine a some adults finding the movie dull; \"Nothing happens,\" they'll say. \"And it's too nice.\" But I can imagine other adults loving the film for helping them\u00a0 remember what it's like to be young enough to hide from a movie monster because he's big and weird-looking and then laugh because he's kind of silly, or to want a conversation between the BFG and Sophie to go on a bit longer because the giant has a funny voice and a funnier walk (he lifts each leg as if it's heavier than it is\u2014as if he's a real giant, not a runt).  The giant keeps dreams in jars. Some are good dreams. Others are\r\n scary. The giant doesn't want Sophie to experience the scary dreams, not because there are monsters in them (though sometimes there are) but because they say hurtful things to the dreamer. The giant can be lyrical and inspiring, especially when he talks about how he loves the land and tries to listen to it. \"The funniest stories I hear are from the trees themselves,\" he tells Sophie. \"All the secret whispers of the world.\" But most other times he garbles ordinary words into malapropisms: \"Feature of habit.\" \"De-lumptious.\"\u00a0 Advertisement The movie is never too exact about its meanings; they're fluid, changing to reflect a given situation. That means the giant can be an adult who has brought a child into his \r\nworld and is scared she might die because of something he did, or failed to do. But he can also be a child who lets himself be mothered by Sophie, a kid who was forced to grow up too fast. From a distance, the shambling, silver-haired BFG often suggests a doting but scatterbrained grandfather. The \r\nbigger giants in the land of the giants stalk around like irresponsible,\r\n petty, volatile parents who have no idea how to give or accept love \r\nbecause they never learned how. (The BFG tells Sophie that giants don't \r\nhave parents.) \u00a0 Most scenes in \"The BFG\" take their time unfolding. Many consist of Sophie and the BFG talking as real friends might. Some are scored with John Williams' default \"Isn't this a marvelous adventure?\" music, which slightly dulls their sense of wonder, but others are so quiet that you can hear insects whirring and the wind moving through the grass. During action scenes, Spielberg doesn't hammer your eyeballs with fast cuts to keep you interested; he stages a lot of the conversations in long takes and keeps the camera far back, the better to allow you to appreciate the way the characters move through the frame, how they carry themselves, what they do with their hands. Close-ups are doled out sparingly, to amplify emotional moments or\u00a0 deliver the punchlines to comic ones, as when the giant eats a meal prepared by humans and Spielberg cuts to a shot of the utensils they've provided: a sword, a pitchfork and a shovel.\u00a0 Every few seconds there's an image that delights for delight's sake, such as the way the giant, sneaking out of London at night with Sophie hidden in his satchel, uses his wits and the wings of his long coat to camouflage himself: assuming the silhouetted shape of a tree; leaning back into the dark hollows of a building while covering a streetlight bulb with his hand. Spielberg and his regular cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, have an eye for bold graphic images: the giant's reflection seeming to stand upside-down on the bank of a lake he's just dived into; one of the bigger giants shielding himself against rain by hoisting up a human-sized umbrella; the BFG striding through a\u00a0 \"gate\" that marks the border of the land of giants: a zigzag rock formation, crooked like a swimmer's elbow. This is a kind-souled movie about kind souls. Sophie's glasses make it through just fine.   Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Heat", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "There's a scene in \"The Heat\" in which two people, FBI agent Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) and Boston police detective Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy), struggle with one another to be the first to open a door. It has already been established that Mullins resents the snooty interference of an FBI outsider into her case. We also know that Ashburn has problems getting along with, well, anyone. Ashburn and Mullins are forced to work together to bring down a Boston drug kingpin, or something like that \u2014 it doesn't matter \u2014 and for the majority of the film they bicker over whose case it is, whose interrogation style to follow, who knows more about the background intel. Advertisement All of that comes to comedic fruition in a lingering slapstick scene of the two women in a death-grip with the door, unable to move forward, unable to retreat, both willing to look completely foolish in order to be the first one through that door. Director Paul Feig (who helmed \"Bridesmaids\") knows his way around slapstick moments such as this one. He is confident that the event being filmed is funny and worth watching, so he stands back, points the camera, and lets the actresses go to it. It's a very funny bit of physical comedy, deeply logical (neither character can bear to be \"second\" in anything) and yet deeply illogical (who cares who goes through the door first?). It's a pleasure to watch a film that is confident in what it is. Yes, it's a cop-buddy film, and of course there is a case to be solved. But nobody cares about the familiarity of the premise. You get the sense that Paul Feig doesn't care either. The Boston-drug-lord-plot is merely the architecture on which to present the dynamic of the two main characters. Their dynamic is consistently humorous, entertaining, often cringe-inducingly awkward, and, occasionally deep. The pace of the film is uneven, and the big plot-points are presented so casually that you can almost feel how bored everyone is by having to spend time on them, but Bullock and McCarthy make a phenomenal team. The conversation never stops. The arguments never stop. You can forgive a lot if a film shows you watchable, interesting characters. Sarah Ashburn lives alone, is a workaholic, and kidnaps the neighbor's cat periodically in order to get some affection. She is gunning for a promotion at the FBI. Her boss tells her she needs to work on her people skills, and as a test he sends her up to Boston to try to bring down a drug kingpin. Working with the local agencies has been a problem for Ashburn, who strides around so arrogantly that she has to be told no less than five times in one scene that she is going the wrong way. On the other side of the spectrum sits Boston Detective Mullins, wearing a Paw Sox T-shirt (a perfect detail), and wreaking havoc amongst neighborhood thugs and small-time drug dealers and prostitutes. The rest of the department lives in fear of her, and within two seconds of spending time with Mullins you can see why. Advertisement Ashburn is assigned to investigate Mullins' case. They are supposed to work together. Neither character is okay with the partnership. This is clich\u00e9d stuff, the mismatched battling duo, but it's worked in comedies since the beginning of time and it works here. Ashburn is buttoned-up (both emotionally and physically), and Mullins lets it all hang out. Each are equally horrified by the other. Clich\u00e9s are avoided.\u00a0Bullock has played cops before, and she does officious bureaucratic-speak very well, but here she adds a flicker of panic and need in her eyes which makes her awkward and pathetic. You can smell her misery. And perhaps the most tragic sight I will see all year is Bullock standing miserably in the nightclub bathroom, mortified because her Spanx have been revealed.\u00a0Mullins has an active sex life (she is approached twice by men who \r\nwonder why she never called them: \"I thought we had fun the other \r\nnight\"). Unlike Ashburn, she seems comfortable in her own skin.  The character is is reminiscent of Megan, whom McCarthy got an Oscar nomination for playing in \"Bridesmaids.\" That movie's pooping-in-the-sink scene got a lot of commentary, but I was more fascinated by the fact that McCarthy's character worked at some high-level government job, bought an 18-wheeler for no reason, had zero neurosis, and was in many ways \"having it all\", something none of the other characters can say.\u00a0 Working the case brings Mullins and Ashburn into contact with a series of crackpots and weirdos, an albino D.E.A agent (played by Dan Bakkedahl; \"You look evil as shit,\" comments Mullins, a conscious callback to the albino villain in \"Foul Play\", seen on a television earlier in the film), a nasty drug addict named Tatiana (the hilarious Kaitlin Olson, who only has one scene, and kills it), and an exhausted white-haired police sergeant who says, \"This job is destroying me. I'm 43. My son calls me Grandpa.\" Mullins comes from a big crazy Boston family whose members are no longer speaking to Mullins because she put her own brother (Michael Rapaport) in jail. Mullins' own mother (played by the criminally underused Jane Curtin) slows down the car as she drives past Mullins, holding up her middle finger. \"The Heat\" is violent, with some pretty gruesome moments and some questionable police work. That's part of the fun. Cagney and Lacey these two ain't. When they finally join forces, they go rogue with a gusto that is refreshing. The movie acknowledges the uphill battle women face in male-dominated workplaces\u2014in this case, law enforcement\u2014but it handles the matter in throwaway lines, an admirable choice. Neither Mullins nor Ashburn are complainers, and they know by heart the compromises they face, and they know that it will be doubly hard for them to move ahead because of their sex. But they don't dwell on it. They're too busy. When they do finally bond, it doesn't come in the usual package of relationship advice, personal revelations, or a makeover scene, although all of these tropes are acknowledged and then tweaked, turned inside out. \"The Heat\" turns female-buddy picture conventions on their ear. Good. Uneven pace and irrelevant plot aside, I keep thinking of Bullock and McCarthy struggling with that door, frozen in a pointless battle of wills, bodies contorted into insane positions in order to impede the other. It's a scene that expands into an almost transcendent comic loopiness the longer it goes on. Who will win? How long can this standoff last? Don't these women realize how ridiculous they look? They do, and that's the point. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Level Five", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The late French filmmaker Chris Marker, who died in 2012 at\r\nthe age of 91, was a pioneer of what some critics call the \u201cessay film,\u201d but\r\nhe\u2019s best known for his (perhaps) entirely fictional short, the seminal 1962\r\ntime-travel tale \u201cLa Jet\u00e9e.\u201d That less-than-a-half-hour movie is a massive\r\ninfluence on almost every sci-fi piece on time-travel since, not to mention a\r\ndirect, credited inspiration for Terry Gilliam\u2019s visionary feature \u201cTwelve\r\nMonkeys.\u201d\u00a0 He never made another film\r\nlike it, at least directly like it. But every one of his nearly 60 other films\r\nare intimately tied to that masterpiece, because they are all about human perception\r\nand history and memory, and how they all warp our lives.  Advertisement His 1997 movie \u201cLevel Five\u201d is only now getting a release in\r\nthe United States, and it\u2019s a fascinating hybrid. Shot with low-budget\r\nequipment suited to a putatively rough-and-ready aesthetic, it\u2019s a fictional\r\ndocumentary examining the battle of Okinawa in World War II, a conflict that,\r\nby Marker\u2019s lights, helped usher in the terrifying atomic age in which we still\r\nlive. Marker\u2019s other works, remarkable movies such as \u201cA Grin Without A Cat\u201d and\r\n\u201cSans soleil,\u201d bracing, personally inflected treatments of historical studies\r\nand anthropology, established the filmmaker as someone for whom the idea of\r\n\u201cobjective\u201d history is thoroughly objectionable. So here he treats Okinawa\r\nthrough a fictionally contrived premise: the labors of Laura (Catherine\r\nBelkhodja) a computer enthusiast and video game developer, as she tries to\r\ndevelop a strategy game based on the battle\u2014a cyber rewrite of history, in a\r\nsense. Marker\u2019s narrator lightly interrogates Laura, who keeps a video diary of\r\nsorts, and teases the unseen filmmaker with personal reminiscences of their\r\nrelationship, for instance, recollecting the first time they heard David\r\nRaksin\u2019s musical theme to Otto Preminger\u2019s film \u201cLaura\u201d together.  \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with Okinawa?\u201d you may well ask now,\r\nand I\u2019m not sure the movie will give you a satisfactory answer. All of Marker\u2019s\r\nphilosophical explorations are tinged, at the very least, by his own cinephilia\r\n(like many French filmmakers of his generation, he was active as a critic and\r\nin a sense remained so throughout his life), and for those who like their\r\nprobings into historical trauma straight down the alley and digression-free,\r\n\u201cLevel Five\u201d will be a very frustrating and arguably overly French experience.\r\nI say \u201cFrench\u201d because the movie partakes in a kind of discourse that\u2019s very\r\nmuch in a French intellectual tradition, the discursive semiotic inquiry in\r\nwhich one\u2019s own cast of mind is necessarily grist for the cerebral mill. In\r\nother words, it\u2019s Marker\u2019s position that he cannot make a film \u201cabout\u201d Okinawa\r\neven if he and his cinematographer travel and shoot there (which they did); he\r\ncan only make a film about thinking about Okinawa. That being what this is, if\r\nyou can hook into it, \u201cLevel Five\u201d is not just witty, insinuating, and\r\npenetrating; it\u2019s also unexpectedly moving and, as deliberately threadbare as\r\nit often looks, cinematically rich. Its imagery derives directly from a time\r\nwhen computer graphics were so much cruder than they\u2019ve become that it\u2019s almost\r\ndifficult to believe. Laura\u2019s interaction with protocols, mysterious\r\nindividuals in user groups and chat rooms of the late \u201890s, underscores the way\r\ntechnology is constantly seeming to redefine epistemology; this makes \u201cLevel\r\nFive\u201d a kind of prophetic text in a way perhaps Marker himself didn\u2019t even\r\nanticipate. Is it a \u201cmasterpiece?\u201d Who\u2019s to say; but like every other film\r\nMarker made, it\u2019s an exemplary and resonant address on the life of the mind and\r\nthe life outside of that one.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Nightmare", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"To die - to sleep.To sleep - perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!For in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coilMust give us pause.\" - Hamlet, Act III, scene 1 \u00a0 What is so striking is the similarity of the stories. People describe lying in bed, awake, unable to move. There is a tingling sensation, like static, like nerve endings shorting out from overuse. People describe a feeling that something is approaching, from behind them, or towards them. Along with that approach comes an overwhelming sense of evil. Dark amorphous shadow figures appear, somewhat human-like, leaning over the person lying in bed, appearing at the door frame. Sometimes the dark figure wears a hat. Something terrible is going to happen and the person is unable to move or to react. This is the experience commonly known as \"sleep paralysis\" and is the subject of Rodney Ascher's engaging horror-film-like documentary, \"The Nightmare.\"\u00a0 Advertisement Ascher does not focus on the many theories as to what causes sleep paralysis (stress, interrupted REM sleep). The theories come up, but only through the voices of those who experience the phenomenon. There are no official talking heads from the scientific community, showing us diagrams of sleep cycles or brain waves. Instead, \"The Nightmare\" is filled with people from different regions of the country (and the world) telling their stories, accompanied by creepy re-enactments of their sleep paralysis nightmares. Using a horror-film color palette (the shadows are \"Lost Highway\"-thick) and horror-film camera techniques, Ascher plunges us into the actual visions that sleep paralysis creates: the moving silhouette figures, the darkness, the static. The sense of terror is palpable.\u00a0 The people telling their stories are filmed in their own homes, but with off-kilter angles, and extremely low lighting, making their surroundings look grim and dark. The shadows encroach on all sides. One guy stops telling his story and peers behind his shoulder, freaked out for a second. With one interview subject, Ascher has placed the camera in the next room, peeking through the doorway, an abyss of blackness in between us and the subject. The overall effect gives the sense of a sleep disorder so overpowering that it has changed people's lives forever. One guy admits that one vision was so frightening that \"I immediately stopped being an atheist.\" Some have come to the conclusion that the terror will eventually get so intense that they will die from it. They all look haunted and obsessed. They try to draw pictures of what they saw, scribbling images out when it doesn't look right. They are not believed when they tell their stories. These are not \"bad dreams,\" they are something else entirely. The quotes accumulate throughout the film, bringing with them a sense of dread all their own: \"I thought I was having a stroke.\" \"I felt a presence next to me trying to take my soul out.\" \"And that is when the Shadow Man came towards me.\" \"If I could describe what Death would feel like - it's icy-cold, dark, evil, and it's watching me.\"\u00a0 Many of these people have been \"visited\" (they describe it as such) since they were babies, and for a lot of them a sleep paralysis nightmare is their very first memory. One guy describes two figures made up of television static leaning over his crib, grinning maniacally, reaching in for him. People suffer in isolation, thinking they are the only ones. When the Internet started to rise in importance, one woman decided to see what would happen if she put \"shadow man\" and \"nightmare\" into a Search box, and suddenly she found message boards with people sharing similar stories, and also a label: \"Sleep Paralysis.\" She felt exultant, crying to the camera, \"It's a thing!\" Others found similar moments of connection and recognition, sometimes from very unlikely places. \u00a0A couple of people describe seeing \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" for the first time and feeling like it was a documentary as opposed to a horror-film. Freddy Krueger was the shadow man they saw in their dreams, and he wore a hat, too, as the visions often do. One guy describes seeing \"Communion,\" with Christopher Walken, and recognizing the faces of the aliens as being similar to the barely-perceived faces on the figures he saw at night. He wondered if a lot of alien abduction stories were actually sleep paralysis. \"Insidious,\" too, brought flashes of recognition: That's what it is like! Advertisement Once you start digging deeper, as all of these people do (they become experts in their own condition), you see evidence of \"sleep paralysis\" in all cultures, throughout history. It shows up in myths and folk tales. It has different names but it's the same phenomenon. There's a 1781 painting by Henry Fusili called \"Nightmare\": a woman lies prone across a bed in a white gown, her head flopped over to the side. Crouching on her torso is a small gargoyle-like creature, an incubus, staring directly at the viewer with a malevolent blankness. As the incubus suggests, there is a sexual element to some of these nightmares. One woman describes being raped by a shadow figure who crawled on top of her in bed, and she was unable to move or resist. Fusili's painting is phantasmagorical, but to those in the documentary, it is an accurate depiction of their reality. Each person interviewed has struggled to control their sleep paralysis. Is the condition psychological or physiological? Many of the people interviewed cannot believe or accept that it is a purely physical phenomenon. Everyone describes that there is a spiritual element to the experience, a tug-of-war between Good and Evil. One woman claims she was cured by whispering the word \"Jesus\" repeatedly during a sleep paralysis attack. She was not a religious person in the slightest, but in that moment she realized that the word \"Jesus\" had power. Since then, her sleep paralysis stopped. One guy slept with the television on and that seemed to help for a time. But then it stopped working, so he added another television to the mix, until eventually he had about 10 televisions in his bedroom. \"It made me look like a crazy person,\" he said.\u00a0 Ascher's 2013 documentary \"Room 237\" plunged us into the world of those obsessed with Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining.\" One guy was convinced that Stanley Kubrick helped fake the moon landing footage, and \"The Shining\" was Kubrick's subliminal admission of that. One woman was obsessed with the architecture of The Overlook Hotel, making her own floor plans. \"The Nightmare\" is similarly structured, in that the voices of those telling the stories dominate. There is no omniscient narrator, telling us what it means, or providing us with a larger perspective. \"The Nightmare\" is more effective than the esoteric \"Room 237\" because it represents a full immersion into a common human experience. The re-enactments are superb. While there are similarities in the stories, each person has a different version of the same experience, and Ascher and his production team has worked beautifully to help bring that to life. Bridger Nielson's cinematography is moody and gloomy, inky-black shadows punctuated by fragile colored night-lights, blue-lit doorframes, shadowy figures moving through the blackness, across the foreground, silhouetted in doorways. One person says, memorably, \"All the darkness looks alive.\" It's a terrible thought. Ascher himself has experienced sleep paralysis, and was struck, in his research, by how the stories all sounded the same. What is unique to the sufferer is actually a common experience. In \"The Nightmare,\" he leads us into that other-world of terror where the darkness is alive. And it moves on its own. And it's coming to get you.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Homesman", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The journey in Tommy Lee Jones' \"The Homesman\", based on the 1988 novel \r\nby Glendon Swarthout, travels from west to east, from the unmarked \r\nNebraska territory to a town in Iowa. It is a reverse trajectory of the \r\ntypical Western path, the wildness of the prairies and plains reverting,\r\n startlingly, to a tame village perched on the edge of the placid \r\nMissouri River. When civilization finally arrives in the final section \r\nof the film, it seems palpably fragile; what has come before is so \r\nunremittingly desolate.  Advertisement \"The Homesman,\" despite the title, is about \r\nwomen. Women are the center of the action, women drive the action \r\nforward, women are not only damsels in distress but heroic figures of \r\ngrit and courage (sometimes in the same moment). The men are helpless \r\nbystanders or ambiguous allies. There is only one villain in the film, \r\nand he is a villain because he is callous. He lacks empathy. Tommy Lee \r\nJones, as a director, homes in on the surreal aspects of the story with \r\nbeautiful sensitivity and strangeness (\"The Homesman\" is an extremely \r\nstrange film), highlighting the monotony of the landscape in which \r\nfigures are either dwarfed by the vastness of it or tower above the flat\r\n horizon. The West, as seen in \"The Homesman,\" is an unforgiving place, \r\nwith flashes of stark and nightmarish beauty. Three women have lost \r\ntheir minds in \"The Homesman,\" but honestly, everyone you meet in the \r\nfilm is slightly crazy, the homesman most of all. Nobody is a pillar of \r\nmental health. Sanity, then, could be seen as overrated, especially in a\r\n world like the one in \"The Homesman.\" And those who lose their minds \r\nmay very well be the only realists in the story. These are deeply \r\nsuggestive ideas, and when \"The Homesman\" works best it teeters around \r\nin that morally ambiguous territory. It's a risky film. Sometimes the \r\nrisks pay off, sometimes they don't, but the feeling of risk infuses the\r\n film with chaos, humor, violence, beauty. \"The Homesman\" doesn't play \r\nthings safe, and that's a welcome change. \r\nMary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) is a middle-aged woman, born in upstate \r\nNew York, who has bought land in the Nebraska territory. She is \r\nunmarried and farms the land herself. She yearns to buy a piano and \r\ncomforts herself by playing hymns on a cloth keyboard. She is seen early\r\n on proposing marriage to a farmer who owns land adjacent to hers. She \r\npitches it as a business proposition, although there is an urgent need \r\nand fragility beneath her words that tell a different story. He turns \r\nher down pretty bluntly: \"You're too bossy and you're too damn plain.\" \r\nIt hurts, it hurts bad, but Mary Bee does not pity herself. She has too \r\nmuch work to do. \r\nDuring the tail-end of a particularly terrible winter, three women in \r\nthe area descend into varying degrees of psychosis, dissociation, \r\nself-harm, and derangement. It is clear that they need to be transported\r\n to a place that can treat them, and the minister (John Lithgow) has a \r\nconnection with a church in Iowa that has agreed to take them in. When \r\nthe menfolk in the congregation balk at the job of transport, Mary Bee \r\ntakes it on. A glorified paddy wagon is provided, complete with iron \r\nrings on the interior in order to chain the women in place, should it be\r\n necessary. The journey will be dangerous and long, and Mary Bee needs to\r\n hire a homesman, and George Briggs, a drunken out-for-himself \r\nclaim-jumper, is just the man for the job. Mary Bee pitches it to him \r\nwith the same matter-of-fact tone that she proposed marriage, telling \r\nhim exactly what she needs and expects, and exactly what she will not \r\ntolerate. He's a bit of a buffoon, in his filthy long-johns and whining \r\nvoice, but he needs the money. Advertisement \r\nThe early introduction of the three madwomen is presented hauntingly by \r\nJones. The images flash onto the screen, interrupting the main action of\r\n Mary Bee at her farm, and Jones crafts a collage of terror and \r\ndread. Gro Svendsen (Sonja Richter) is a Scandinavian woman, seen \r\nscreaming in agony as her husband drags her dead mother out into the \r\nsnowy night: the corpse is stinking, she can't stay in the house \r\nanymore. Arabella (Grace Gummer) is a teenager, with a young husband, \r\nand her three babies died in a matter of days from diphtheria. She has \r\ngone comatose, staring out the window, clutching a rag doll. Theoline \r\n(Miranda Otto) is shown strolling outside into a biting snowstorm, a \r\nwailing purple newborn nipping at her bare breast, and she casually \r\ntosses the baby down the hole in the outhouse; the most harrowing image \r\nin the film. The presentation of madness is both compassionate and \r\nunblinking. \r\nBriggs is a comic figure in the beginning, a drawling and \r\ninappropriately insouciant Walter Brennan-type character, garrulous and \r\ncareless, demanding Mary Bee buy him a jug of whiskey for the ride. The \r\ndynamic between Briggs and pious straight-talking spinster is one of the\r\n pleasures of the film. It almost becomes a classic buddy picture. Both \r\ncharacters are outlaws. Neither of them fit into \"normal\" society. Both \r\nof them are individualists, who value strength, who have strength, but \r\nwho will always be just a little bit on the periphery of accepted norms.\r\n This could be seen as a tragedy for them; it could be seen as a \r\ntriumph. The film does not come down on either side. The situation is \r\nnot \"either/or\". It is \"both/and.\" \r\nThere are confrontations with the elements during the journey; there are\r\n moments when they lose control of the women. One breaks free; one \r\nkicks the other in the face; one is unable or unwilling to handle her own\r\n bodily functions as Briggs lifts her skirt up for her and barks, \"Squat now. Come on. Pee.\" At first wary with one another, and at \r\nsome moments damn near confrontational, Briggs and Mary Bee find that \r\nthey are good partners, tag-teaming the job, and talking at night over \r\nthe crackling fire as the three women lie tied up to the wagon wheels, \r\nasleep or in a daze. Advertisement \r\nFor most of the film, it is Mary Bee's story. She is its anchor, and \r\nBriggs is her sidekick. Something happens three-fourths of the way through that \r\nputs Briggs in the center, as the title character. Having not read the \r\nnovel, the moment came as an enormous surprise, almost shattering the \r\nfabric of the film, as harrowing, in its way, of the vision of the \r\nmother throwing her baby into the privy hole. In thinking back on it, \r\nthere are fragments of behavior shown, glimpses of inner life, that \r\nmakes that moment inevitable, in retrospect. The film expands \r\nexponentially as the formal narrative is destabilized, and things get \r\ndistinctly stranger, although Jones keeps his eye on the overall theme \r\nof madness and survival; trauma and strength. \r\nThe strangest section of the film involves a stop-over at the Fairfield \r\nHotel, standing alone in the middle of the plains, like an Andrew Wyeth \r\npainting, reminiscent of Sam Shepard's house in Terrence \r\nMalick's \"Days of Heaven.\" The smooth-talking Irishman proprietor (James Spader) hopes to \r\nattract investors to this little spot in the middle of nowhere, \r\nsurrounded by sheer emptiness.  So he's a little nuts, too. Beautifully conceived and \r\nshot, the section is a tangent, but it is extremely revealing about \r\nBriggs' character, as well as a sardonic, pointed commentary about the \r\nconcept of civilization. Civilization, as represented by the small \r\nhuddle of farms out in Nebraska, does its best to help those who need \r\nit. Civilization, as represented by the tiny town in Iowa, is kind and \r\ngenteel, although it doesn't quite know what to do with a man like \r\nBriggs. Elsewhere, though, like at the totally empty Fairfield Hotel, \r\nwith its sideboard heaped with luscious food, and its paintings of naked\r\n women in the lobby, civilization is cold and unfeeling. There is an \r\nargument to be made that the only place where someone like Briggs, or \r\nsomeone like Mary Bee, could ever hope to \"fit in\" is out there in the \r\nunmarked territories, cutting their way into the land, relying only on \r\nthemselves, a landscape where eccentricity is an asset. \r\nJones' visual style is simple and clean, and cinematographer Rodrigo \r\nPrieto finds some gorgeous John Ford touches; people shown in black \r\nsilhouette through barn doorways, or house doorways, with the vast \r\nbright landscape beyond, a clear demarcation between interior and \r\nexterior, displaying the individual against the sheer size of the land out there. \r\nThere's a section where Mary Bee gets separated from the wagon and \r\nwanders the plains through the dark night on her horse, disoriented and \r\nlost, calling out for Briggs, resorting to chewing on grass like a feral\r\n creature. These dark sequences have the hallucinatory quality of a \r\nnightmare. Advertisement \r\nNovelist Glendon Swarthout was interested in unlikely characters who \r\nhave to show extraordinary courage and strength. He was interested in \r\nthe moral ambiguities of familiar genres. The best example of this comes\r\n in his most famous book, \"Bless the Beasts and the \r\nChildren\" (which has never gone out of print since it was \r\npublished in 1971). \"Bless the Beasts and the Children\"\r\n tells the story of a group of misfit kids who have been sent to a boys'\r\n home/dude ranch in the American Southwest. Turned into a film in 1972, \r\ndirected by Stanley Kramer, it takes the age-old themes of the Western \r\n(man vs. nature, man vs. the landscape, man vs. himself) and pours it \r\ninto the service of a modern coming-of-age drama. \"The Homesman,\" like \r\n\"Bless the Beasts\" questions the \"norm\". It asks questions about what \r\nstrength looks like (in men and in women), and also what strength might \r\nactually mean, what it signifies. Holding a rifle on an enemy requires \r\nstrength. So does being kind and caring to someone who has descended \r\ninto psychosis. Jones puts all of those elements on a level playing \r\nfield. Women are misfits here because of their biology. Biology could be\r\n seen as an enemy: motherhood is wonderful, but terrible when your \r\ninfant triplets all die on the same day. And what of those, like Mary \r\nBee, who have been denied the \"natural\" outlet for women, through \r\nwifehood and motherhood? What does biology mean then? \r\nThe final section of the film is suddenly conventional, and represents a\r\n confused petering-out of strength, a tame meandering coda to the \r\nchaotic thrust of the story. It's almost like \"The Homesman,\" barreling \r\nalong at a high speed, powerful and weird and funny and terrible, hits \r\nan invisible speed bump all of a sudden, and the pieces fly apart. But \r\nthe conventional coda cannot erase the risk-filled pleasure of all that \r\ncame before.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "All We Had", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Rita and Ruthie are like two peas in a pod. They tag-team shoplift. They run from crisis together. They camp out in their beat-up car, eating French Fries. When they have a place to stay, they sleep in the same bed, spooned up against each other. They look like they could be sisters. But Rita is the mother, Ruthie is the 14-year-old daughter, and they are the central characters in \"All We Had,\" Katie Holmes' directorial debut, adapted from Annie Weatherwax's 2015 novel.   Rita makes horrible choices in her life (if they can even be called choices), and she runs away when things get tough, dragging Ruthie (Stefania Owen) behind her. This is where the film starts. Mother and daughter paint a dream-life together: they will move to Boston, in a house with a pool. Stranded in a small town after their car breaks down, with no money and no place to stay, Rita and Ruthie are offered jobs at the local diner (after trying to leave without paying for their food). Marty (Richard Kind), the diner owner, and his transgender waitress niece Pam (Eve Lindley) are kind and generous, and the four create a makeshift family. Advertisement   The film is narrated by Ruthie, and the overstating-the-obvious voiceover narration sounds like it is geared towards a YA audience: \"Bullies exist in every small town. People hate what they don't understand.\" Or: \"Why is life always so hard? Especially at 15?\" Ruthie's voiceover is our \"way into\" the \"point of view\" of \"All We Had,\" but there are many scenes with Ruthie not present at all. Ruthie's struggles to fit in at a new school, the ease with which she gets the approval of a Queen Bee classmate (using the tactics she learned from watching her manipulative mother), are intriguing, but dropped in favor of following Rita through her addiction and recovery issues. Rita starts to date a real estate developer (Mark Consuelos), who gets them into a house, all while Ruthie looks on suspiciously, wondering when the shoe will drop, because the shoe always drops.   Luke Wilson plays Lee, an alcoholic widower who frequents the diner. Wilson has been around for a long time now. Associated mainly with Wes Anderson's films, he has also had a wonderful career playing essentially decent stand-up guys (\"The Family Stone,\" \"The Skeleton Twins,\" \"Meadowland.\") Playing \"a decent guy\" is not as easy as Luke Wilson makes it look. Most actors would find these roles boring. Where's the twisty dark neuroticism actors love to revel in? Where's the \"edginess\"? But Wilson knows there is gold in these characters. In \"All We Had,\" when emotions come up in him, they come like an ambush. Suddenly out of nowhere, he realizes he is about to cry and he is scared: Where did THAT come from?\u00a0This feels like real life, not acting. He doesn't have a huge role in \"All We Had\" but in every scene he brings a quiet sense of unmistakable authenticity.   Eve Lindley is lovely as the small-town waitress who wants to move to New York, biding her time doing craft projects and putting up Youtube videos of herself lip-synching to Queen songs. She's a simple person, but she has a good heart, and she and Ruthie become best friends in a way that is wholly believable. Holmes was very smart in her casting choices throughout. Even secondary or one-off characters are well cast.   It is obvious why Holmes would want to play a character like Rita, an irresponsible and reckless child-woman. Rita could still be deemed pretty if you ignored the rough skin, the missing molar, and the panicky eyes smudged around with blue liner. For the most part, Holmes avoids the condescending traps inherent in such a role, and plays it straight. Owen, who was so wonderful in \"Coming Through the Rye,\" is very good here, too, especially when Ruthie feels protective of her mother, giving her mother's bad choices the side-eye, knowing how it all will turn out. Advertisement   The adaptation (by Josh Boone and Jill Killington) lacks any inference, mystery, or discovery: it is all text. Any complexity that there may be is all on the surface. Problems are easily solved, since there's nothing left unsaid, or if something is left unsaid Ruthie says it for us in the voiceover. This makes for predictable viewing. \"All We Had\" feels like episodic television of the 1980s/90s variety. The words \"It's all going to be okay\" (and variations thereof) are said so often I lost count. Having every emotional scene include the words \"Everything's going to be okay\" lessens the tension almost totally. \"All We Had\" takes place in a high-stakes economically devastated landscape, where everyone struggles with money and addiction and survival. The economic crash is so brutal that even Ruthie feels it, riding her bike past empty storefronts. But \"All We Had\" tiptoes back from that abyss.   Even artists have a way of keeping things low-stakes for themselves if they're not rigorous about it. With her well-meaning desire to create an inspirational story of survival and redemption (and, to be fair, she has succeeded), Holmes has kept the entire film extremely low-stakes. You never doubt for one second that \"everything is going to be okay.\"", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Merry Christmas", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Anna Condo's sarcastically titled \"Merry Christmas\" shows what happens when a group of upper-crust New Yorkers travel to the wilds of Pennsylvania to spend their Christmas holidays playing a murder mystery game at a remote bed and breakfast. The film spends no time on exposition, and so we have no idea who any of these people are in relation to one another before they put on outrageous Studio 54\u2013type outfits to immerse themselves in the disco dance club- themed murder mystery. The game is run by the B&B owner Kay, who questions each \"witness,\" and keeps the game from derailing over the course of the weekend. Meanwhile, the guests booze it up, play the piano, bicker constantly, and simmer tepidly with vague resentment and ennui. Through the playing of the game, the real life characters' true personalities emerge, and we can see that this is a pretty heartless bunch. Advertisement All of that would be fine (and even brilliant, perhaps) in the hands of, say, Luis Bunuel, but the overall effect in \"Merry Christmas\" is unfocused and lazy. The film feels like an acting game running its course, with various conflicts introduced throughout in a haphazard and \r\ncontrived manner. The problem is that the stakes are low to the point of non-existence, and there's just no excuse for that. \u00a0There is some attempt to create tension here, primarily through the world-weary cynical Brit Ted (Antony Langdon), who wants to open up a \"caviar bar\" in New York, mainly because he is sick of what he sees as the too-casual culture of today. He wants to see \"formality\" return to our public places, and he hopes some of his friends vacationing with him will invest in his \"caviar bar\". This is the only discernible \"want\" expressed in the picture, and it's hard to have any feelings about it one way or another. Even Ted seems bored by it. Filmed in two-and-a-half days at an actual B&B, the film is made up primarily of improvisation, and it shows. It gives one an increased appreciation for someone like John Cassavetes, whose great technical skill and understanding of story helped him create an environment of inspired and yet controlled chaos, where the audience truly believes that what they are seeing is spontaneous even though the actors are working within strict narrative guidelines. In \"Merry Christmas\", in contrast, we see a lot of people standing around chatting, making jokes, sipping wine, and having petty little arguments, but none of the moments have any underlying charge. The big conflict, which comes late in the game, is well done and effective (all of the actors are wonderful), but it is too little, too late. The camerawork is sloppy and awkward, with herky-jerk zooms and crazy pans to left and right looking for the event \r\nof the scene, often missing the faces we want to see by a mile. Halfway through, a homeless man who looks like either Jesus Christ or Rasputin shows up at the door and is invited to have a meal and join the game, even though he is nearly catatonic and entirely mute. Who is he? Is he part of the game? His appearance is a catalyst, for sure, and things get sort of ugly, not to mention the fact that everyone seems to be too busy patting themselves on the back for including a homeless man in their reindeer games to even notice that they are talking about him while he is right there. He disappears in the morning, leaving a cryptic note behind, which has intriguing possibilities, all left unexplored. A drunken conversation erupts about the concept of the \"idiot\" in Russian culture and literature, the wandering naive man baffled by wealth and cynicism, most accurately presented by Dostoevsky in his novel \"The Idiot'. But the idea is dropped. Too bad.  Advertisement There are moments when sparks fly, and that is due entirely to the gifts of the actors. The one African-American in the bunch (Angelique Cinelu) is asked at the table what it feels like to be the only black person present. Things get tense and awkward, and then explode later in another argument. Ted seems to bond with the B&B owner Kay, who is a born-again Christian with a floozy past. They banter about philosophy and sex and God, and there are all kinds of fascinating potentialities going on in their interactions, but it's all left behind and forgotten, like everything else in \"Merry Christmas\" that is potentially important or interesting.  Any one of these characters could have been a delicious villain. If you're going to create a bunch of characters as reprehensible as these, whose only experience of the recession is that \"last year we got to vacation in Aspen, this year we have to come here,\" then don't you want to create a higher-stakes environment for them, one in which they can really be set free? Don't you want to give them something better to do than just sit around and bicker?", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Ardennes", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "This grim, glum story of Belgian criminal brothers was submitted by Belgium to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for consideration as a Best Foreign Language Film nominee. It was, in a smart move by the Academy, declined. The movie, directed by Robin Pront from a script by Pront and Jeroen Perceval (who\u2019s also one of the film\u2019s lead actors), is well-crafted up to a point. But the end to which it is crafted is utterly useless.  \"The Ardennes\" begins with a striking image of a man in a ski mask falling feet first into a swimming pool. After extracting himself, he runs to a waiting car; a tense woman sits in the driver\u2019s seat. Pulling up the ski mask, we see he\u2019s wearing a stocking over his head as well. Uncomfortable. He orders the woman to drive and she does. In a courtroom, moments later, stands a defendant\u2014the man left behind at the scene. He got caught, he didn\u2019t sell out his accomplices, and now he\u2019s sentenced to seven years in prison. Kenny, for that is his name, has a scarred face and a flat-top Mohawk hairstyle, so we suspect he\u2019s already used to a hardened mode of life.  Advertisement As for Dave and Sylvie, the accomplices, they straighten out. Sylvie gives a moving testimonial at her sober anniversary at a support group. (Memo to contemporary directors depicting circles of chairs in support group meetings: just because it\u2019s a circle of chairs doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obliged to break out the old 360-degree dolly. It\u2019s old. And boring.) Dave has stopped drinking and drugging and keeps his head down at a crummy job at a big car wash. One day, his boss, who chain-smokes and watches football nonstop in his office, summons him to the phone. Kenny\u2019s getting out, Dave\u2019s mom informs him. As it happens, Dave is Kenny\u2019s brother, Sylvie is now Dave\u2019s lover but was formerly Kenny\u2019s lover, Dave and Kenny\u2019s mom is generally disgusted with both of the boys, and Sylvie is pregnant with Dave\u2019s child.  Hoo boy. Kenny\u2019s reentry into society is not helped by his thuggish demeanor, his expectation that Sylvie is going to take up with him again, or pretty much anything else. For what appears to be an unconscionable length of time, we sit with these characters as they try to hide the whole truth from Kenny. And this seems reasonably easy, as Kenny not only has a poor attitude overall but is kind of dumb as well. Eventually, the viewer learns he\u2019s not as dumb as all that, although the movie never drops a clue in that direction. And then \"The Ardennes\" reveals he\u2019s also even dumber than all that. In any event, action, such as it is, picks up when Kenny summons Dave to a parking garage, to show his brother that he, Kenny, has stashed a dead body into the rear compartment of his, Dave\u2019s, car. So begins the final leg of their reunion, from Antwerp to the forested area of Belgium called The Ardennes, the setting of idyllic scenes from more innocent boyhood days. They are not to be revisited this time, as their journey brings them into liaisons with a criminal drag queen and Kenny\u2019s former cell-mate.  The Antwerp depicted in this movie looks like some kind of purgatory on earth; there\u2019s never a sunny day, it\u2019s always wet and murky out, people look malnourished or generally sickly. Kenny distinguishes his status as a Lucifer-like figure by skulking around in a bright red puffy jacket, the most vivid visual in this deliberately grey and dank film. The actors\u2014co-writer Perceval is Dave, Kevin Janssens is Kenny, Veerle Baetens (who was outstanding in another miserable Belgian film, 2012\u2019s \u201cThe Broken Circle Breakdown\u201d) is Sylvie, and Viviane de Muynck brings slight echoes of Jackie Weaver in \u201cAnimal Kingdom\u201d to her work as Kenny and Dave\u2019s mom\u2014all do credible stuff here. But the character examination is utterly predictable, and when the movie breaks free of its domestic discomfort for a road trip with some ridiculous/absurd diversions (an intra-criminal standoff is broken up by an animal rampage that ought to have been either hilarious or utterly terrifying, and ends up neither), it\u2019s merely building to a grisly and repellent punchline that represents tough-boy cinematic nihilism at its most tedious.

{"Title": "Treading Water", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Treading Water\" is a weird and funny coming-of-age story about a boy who has the normal teenage problems: an overbearing mother, an indifferent father, no love life ... and he also has a condition called Trimethylaminuria, otherwise known as \"fish odor symptom.\" Trimethylaminuria is an endocrinology disorder, where the body doesn't produce certain enzymes, resulting in a \"fish smell.\" The film originally was called \"The Boy Who Smells Like Fish,\" showing the story's fable-like structure, but that was given up in favor of a more generic title. The fact that writer/director Analeine Cal y Mayor has created a whimsical little comedy out of a boy who goes through life smelling like fish is one of the main delights of \"Treading Water.\" Cal y Mayor takes a light touch, bordering on the surreal. The movie doesn't quite hold together at times, and some of the darker elements (like what it feels like to be shamed and shunned at every moment of your life) are soft-pedaled. But it has a strange charm nonetheless. Advertisement Douglas Smith plays Mica, who enters this world smelling of fish (the doctor in the delivery room scrunches up his nose as he hands the baby to the mother). Mica's parents are played by Ariadna Gil and Don McKellar (\"Slings and Arrows\" fans will remember his turn as the ridiculously pretentious guest-director Darren Nichols.) Worried about why their son smells so bad, they take him to a round of doctors and quacks and gurus, who suggest using a specific soap, or who do weird rituals over his head in a candle-lit room. As the child grows, he is bullied at school. He knows he smells so he spends most of his time soaking in the bathtub, sometimes submerging himself completely where he swims around in a dreamy blue world of freedom. By the time Mica is a teenager, his father has abandoned the family, and Mica has isolated himself, spending most of his time at the local pool. He wears an air-freshener around his neck. He talks about his life with his therapist (Carrie Anne Moss). He has a crush on a girl he met at the pool (Zo\u00eb Kravitz), who remembers him from grade-school. He hesitates to pursue her. Because he smells.\u00a0 Yes, it is all a bit silly, and the silliness is underlined by the house in which Mica and his mother live. It is the home of a famous Mexican singer named Guillermo Garibai (Gonzalo Vega), turned into a museum. Mica's mother gives tours. The walls are covered with kitschy portraits of Garibai and framed gold records, and the decor has not been updated since Garibai lived there in the late 1960s and early 1970s. To walk from the living room to the kitchen you have to swerve around all of the velvet ropes. Garibai fans show up at the door in small groups, dressed to the nines, sporting beehive hairdos and colorful dresses. If you've visited Graceland, you know the type. Garabai was their hero, their heartthrob, and they Ooh and Aah over every \"relic\" saved in the house, even a broken cologne bottle, preserved under glass. Mica grows up with people wandering randomly through his bedroom (\"and this is the room where Garibai was inspired to write his most famous song\"), interrupting his bath time. Elisa Sauve was the production designer and the set of that house is such a weird and loopy environment that it automatically signals that none of this should be taken <i>too</i> seriously. Yes, the poor boy smells like fish and he has no friends, and yes, all of these bad things happen to his mother and father, but get a load of that house! Cal y Mayor <i>milks</i> that set. She finds every bit of humor possible in having her lead character live in an environment devoted to the idolization of the Mexican Elvis whose hey-day was 40 years before. Mica and Laura's romance is tentative. Both of them are keeping secrets from the other. But nothing is too intense. The romance is not the greatest love of all time, and Mica is more of a passive recipient of events rather than an active participant, a problem with the performance. His stakes always seem pretty low. He has accepted his lot in life. He smells like fish. There is no cure. Mica continues to swirl around underneath the water in the pool, freed up from the dry-day world that recoils from him. The whimsy of the directorial style helps save \"Treading Water\" from being a Disease of the Week television movie.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Treading Water\" reminded me a bit of Arvin Chen's bittersweet comedy \"Will You Still Love Me\u00a0Tomorrow?\" about a gay man who decides to get married and live as a straight man. \u00a0A serious topic, filled with emotional mayhem, but Chen filmed it as a brightly-colored fable, romantic and cinematic, complete with dream sequences and choreographed musical numbers, people opening red umbrellas and floating up into the sky like Mary Poppins. The emotions underlying the events are intense, tragic even, but the mood ends up being one of a yearning attempt at human connection. \"Treading Water\" is not quite as successful in walking that delicate line of mood and tone, but it still has a lot to recommend it.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "O.J.: Made in America", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\u201cWe talk about OJ as though the story is OJ. The story is OJ\r\nAND US.\u201d\r\n\u2014Celia Farber Even in this era of \u201cPeak TV,\u201d it\u2019s rare to see something as\r\nessential and momentous as ESPN\u2019s \u201cOJ: Made in America,\u201d which played film festivals earlier this year and starts this\r\nSaturday, June 11th, and runs all of next week under the network\u2019s \u201c30\r\nFor 30\u201d brand. Ezra Edelman\u2019s stunningly ambitious, eight-hour documentary is a\r\nmasterpiece, a refined piece of investigative journalism that places the\r\nsubject it illuminates into the broader context of the end of the 20th\r\ncentury. You may think you know everything about The Trial of the Century,\r\nespecially if you watched FX\u2019s excellent \u201cThe People vs. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story,\u201d but \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d not only fills in details about the case but\r\noffers background and commentary that you\u2019ve never heard before. It is an\r\nexamination of race, domestic abuse, celebrity, civil rights, the LAPD, the\r\nlegal process and murder over the last fifty years, using the OJ Simpson story\r\nas a way to refract society. Its length may seem daunting, but I would have\r\nwatched it for another eight hours and will almost certainly watch it again before\r\nthe summer is over. It\u2019s that good. Advertisement As broadcast, \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d is split up into five parts.\r\nThe first part plays like a relatively straightforward \u201c30 For 30,\u201d the ESPN\r\nbrand that has delivered fantastic sports documentary filmmaking. It focuses on\r\nthe rise of OJ Simpson, becoming a household name at USC, where he won the\r\nHeisman Trophy in 1968. Edelman very carefully places the rise of Simpson\r\nagainst the backdrop of what was happening to the other black sports figures at\r\nthe time. He includes footage of Muhammad Ali refusing to go to Vietnam and\r\nTommie Smith and John Carlos raising their fists in protest at the 1968\r\nOlympics. OJ was a \u201csafe\u201d black athlete, and even intercuts footage of RFK\r\nannouncing the death of Martin Luther King with Simpson joining Bob Hope on\r\nstage as the host congratulates USC on not having \u201chad a riot, a demonstration,\r\nor even a sit-in.\u201d While black people were trying to change the world, OJ\r\nSimpson went in another direction, and he very verbally and consciously did so,\r\nusing that acceptance to become the first black spokesman for several\r\ncompanies. As someone says, \u201cOJ Simpson was the counter-revolutionary athlete.\u201d\r\nThe key here is that OJ Simpson was already writing a character, responding\r\nmore to how people saw him than anything else. If \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d was just part one, it would be a\r\nfascinating, must-see examination of how celebrity and race worked together in\r\nthe late \u201860s and \u201870s. The second part of \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d chronicles the\r\ninstantly-tumultuous relationship between OJ and Nicole Brown. A friend says\r\nthat her pants were ripped after her first date with OJ and that she said that \u201che\r\ngot a little rough.\u201d At this point, Edelman pivots to a story of how celebrity\r\ncan let people get away with domestic abuse, while also focusing on the state\r\nof race relations in Los Angeles in the \u201880s and \u201890s. As the relationship\r\nbetween the Los Angeles Police Department and minorities in L.A. continued to\r\nheat up, Rodney King became the international example of the violence cops were\r\ninflicting on black people, and, eventually and more importantly, injustice. If\r\nyou\u2019re wondering how or why Rodney King\u2019s beating plays a role in \u201cOJ: Made in\r\nAmerica,\u201d know that one of the jurors in Simpson\u2019s trial later states that she\r\nlet OJ go as revenge for Rodney King. And she\u2019s convinced others did as well. Racist\r\ncops\u2014like those that beat Rodney King and Mark Fuhrman, who the defense argued\r\nframed OJ Simpson\u2014needed to know those days were over. What\u2019s so incredible\r\nabout \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d is how Edelman and his team basically define the\r\nfoundation of what would come in the trial. They don\u2019t jump into the \u201csalacious\r\ndetails.\u201d Nothing as major as the story of OJ Simpson happens in a vacuum. How\r\ndid OJ get there? How did Nicole get there? How did Mark Fuhrman, Chris Darden\r\nand Johnnie Cochran get there? How did we all get there? Of course, the third and fourth part of \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d is\r\ndevoted to the trial, and they do an incredible job of distilling it to essential beats, with notable contributions by Marcia Clark, Gil Garcetti, two\r\njurors and several witnesses, including some of OJ Simpson\u2019s friends, all of\r\nwhom either at that point or today admit that he did it. The details of the\r\nentire piece are what elevate it\u2014eyewitness accounts of the Bronco chase from\r\nthe cops who essentially accompanied a man with a murder charge pending to his\r\nhome (think about that in terms of race and celebrity and ask yourself if they\r\nwouldn\u2019t have just shot out the tires of every other black man in L.A.). The\r\ncops that day went into OJ\u2019s house and saw only pictures of him on the walls.\r\nNo Nicole. No kids. So, they knew they could appeal to his ego to stop him from\r\nkilling himself in that Bronco in his own driveway, where he had a gun under\r\nhis chin.\u00a0 Advertisement These kind of \u201cyou are there\u201d details are riveting, but that's not meant to imply that this is merely a compendium of little-known facts. What really separates \"OJ: Made in America,\" other than its investigative spirit, is the brilliant connections Edelman and his team make through editing. We hear a fascinating story about friends trying to play a prank on a young OJ Simpson and Al \"AC\" Cowlings in which they pulled a starter pistol and AC jumped to protect his best friend. Of course, cut to the Bronco chase, in which AC could have been the last man to see OJ alive if Simpson had done what he intended at several points that day. The attention to detail and brilliant documentary construction carries over to the case as well, where mistakes were made from the very beginning, everywhere but the defense. Edelman paints a portrait of a judge with little control (for no logical reason, he let them walk the jury through Rockingham, where Simpson's team had replaced photos of Juice with his white friends with only black people and African art) and a prosecution team always at least a few steps behind not just their opponents but the world. They didn't comprehend the \"bigger picture\" of fame and race. Here\u2019s\r\njust one of the breathtaking stats in terms of the power of celebrity: 75% of\r\nthe jurors in the questioning period thought that OJ Simpson was unlikely to do\r\nit because he had played football at USC. Marcia Clark drastically overestimated\r\nher likability with black women and ended up with eight on her jury. And OJ\r\nSimpson wasn\u2019t your typical defendant. He knew exactly how to play things. He\r\nwas a part of his defense team. He even knew to stop taking his arthritis\r\nmedicine\u2014which would swell up his hands\u2014two weeks before the testimony about\r\nthe gloves, just in case Chris Darden would ask him to try them on. And we all\r\nknow what happened there. An hour into part four, there\u2019s a detailed recounting of\r\nexactly what happened the night that Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman died, with\r\nbrutal crime scene photos. The horror and violence of that night is jawdropping\r\nand as terrifying as any horror movie. The doc gets graphic, and I started to\r\nget emotional not just because of the impact of the crime but because I\r\nrealized I didn\u2019t know these details before. I interned at a news station\r\nduring the original case and I was as enraptured with the story as anyone but\r\nthe actual horror of the crime was distracted by conspiracy theories and the\r\nblinding light of fame.  Advertisement The final part of \u201cOJ: Made in America\u201d is the only one in which\r\nI can find the slightest flaw in that I wish it was a bit longer. After being\r\nacquitted, OJ Simpson lost his exalted status. He was no longer allowed in the\r\ncountry clubs at which he was formerly the only black member. He was yelled at everywhere\r\nhe went, essentially descended into a life of drugs and violence, which\r\nwould result in his conviction for armed robbery. But he was always obsessed with his image. There\u2019s\r\nan incredible scene in which OJ is taking down the flag at Rockingham, getting\r\nemotional and then pushing the camera away as if a paparazzi had snuck onto\r\nthe grounds. It was staged. Any footage of OJ at the time could be sold to TMZ\r\nfor a pretty penny and Simpson was making money with a buddy, even as his world\r\nwas crashing around him.\u00a0 Whether he was running for a record, leaping through\r\nan airport for Hertz, making sure Nicole knew that she was his property or\r\ngetting angry enough to kill, it was always about OJ and only OJ. To understand\r\nOJ, we have to understand how much of his life was influenced by what he showed\r\nus in the world of celebrity and how we responded to it as a society. \u201cOJ: Made\r\nin America\u201d should be a conversation-starter, a way to discuss what happened in\r\nthe \u201880s and \u201890s in terms of race and celebrity and what it says about today.\r\nOJ\u2019s story may be over. Ours is not.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Da Sweet Blood of Jesus", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Da Sweet Blood of Jesus\" is Spike Lee's first crowdfunded feature and his second remake in a row, following \"Oldboy\" (a film I liked better than most critics), but as you might expect, given the defiantly idiosyncratic nature of this director, it's not content to be a rehash.  The movie follows the template of its source material,\u00a0Bill Gunn's cult favorite\u00a0\"Ganja and Hess,\"\u00a0pretty closely, and even evokes its sorrowful, romantic, dreamy tone as it portrays a love affair between two bloodlusting individuals; but it's connected to the real world. It\u00a0works through many of Lee's familiar preoccupations (including racism, cultural assimilation, class anxiety, capitalistic exploitation and addiction)\u00a0in such a blunt way that it might fit nicely on a double bill with \"Jungle Fever\" or \"Summer of Sam.\" The latter were dismissed as jumbled messes by many, but had an undeniable feverish intensity, as if the writer-director were determined to work through every sociopolitical issue obsessing him at that moment; like many of his films, but even more so, they were kitchen-sink dramas, sermons, music videos and tragedies all at the same time, the individual aspects working at cross-purposes with each other, often thrillingly and sometimes to the films' detriment.  Advertisement But Lee's most persistent problem, an inability to unify his messages and make them cohere, doesn't really hurt him in \"Da Sweet Blood of Jesus\" because the film is a hypnotically nightmarish mood piece more than anything else; it makes sense and yet doesn't make sense, in the way that dreams do and don't make sense. Ideas bleed into other ideas and morph into third, tangentially related\u00a0ideas; notions are teased and then dropped; almost unbearably savage violence is perpetrated on characters who often have done nothing to deserve their fates; not once does Lee trouble himself with questions of likability, much less the possibility that he's following his own muse to the point where he's losing people. This will prove either maddening or refreshing, depending on whether your willingness to go where Lee takes you overwhelms your desire for something more conventionally neat and clearheaded.  Stage actor Stephen Tyrone Williams stars as Dr. Hess Greene, a noted anthropologist studying the ancient Ashanti Empire. In the opening scene, he comes into possession of an ancient dagger that triggers a complete change in his world, which is centered around a handsome Martha's Vineyard estate that measures exactly (ahem) 40 acres. The story, such as it is, kicks into gear when his depressed research assistant, Dr. Hightower (Elvis Nolasco), attempts suicide, then grapples murderously with Hess in a close-quarters struggle involving the dagger. Without giving too much away, let's say that this struggle ends with Hess transformed into a nightcrawling loner with a thirst for human blood.  The term \"bloodsuckers\" has all sorts of political and metaphorical meanings, and many a vampire movie has playfully toyed with them. \"Ganja and Hess,\" a film that emerged less than a decade into the era of black power politics, was one of the more notable examples, and Lee, rewriting Gunn's original script, attempts something similar here. In the run-up to the movie's production, the filmmaker kept insisting that \"Jesus\" was not, strictly speaking, a vampire movie, and while that assertion seems a bit coy (vampires are pretty obviously what we're dealing with) it isn't inaccurate. Hess and many of the other African-American and afro-Caribbean characters are presented as living somewhere in between, or beyond, two familiar movie worlds, the Black inner city and the tony coastal enclaves of wealthy Whites. White \"bloodsuckers\" are glimpsed at Gatsby-like parties on Hess's estate, and talk of how the engines of capitalism grind up the powerless indicts America itself as a kind of vampire empire.  Advertisement But \"Jesus\" moves beyond that to show Hess as a literal and figurative bloodsucker himself, stealing precious bags of red from blood banks, preying on desperate and too-trusting people of color (including a young single mother) to satisfy his unquenchable thirst, and being enabled and in some cases egged on by his new lover Ganja (British actress Zaraah Abraham, camping up the exotic bitchery and exuding poise and menace) and his Renfield-like assistant Seneschal (Rami Malek).\u00a0 And, as in \"Jungle Fever,\" \"Summer of Sam,\" \"Mo' Better Blues\" and\u00a0so many other Spike Lee joints, there's a fascination with addiction, and how it overwhelms empathy and dignity. Without putting too fine a point on it, \"Jesus\" presents all sorts of traditions and institutions as engines of exploitation as well. The U.S. economy, the worship of guns and machismo, and the desire of minorities to get ahead by any means necessary are all seen as manifestations of addiction, or vampirism. It's all one enormous, multi-tentacled argument, and as you've gathered, Lee has trouble controlling it; but again, the horror genre is one of the only genres where it's OK, or at least acceptable, to be imprecise, because it's more often about sustaining a feeling or a mood than making a case. The most impressive thing about \"Jesus\" is its unfailing control of tone. This is manifested in Lee's immaculate and uncharacteristically clean, even sterile, widescreen compositions (shot by Daniel Patterson); Barry Alexander Brown's scalpel-exact edits; and the score, which switches between rap/R&B and Bruce Hornsby's introspective solo piano riffs, but always keeps the volume high. Even the more stilted conversations feel less like freestanding lines than lyrics in a two-hour visual and musical tapestry.  This is clearly intentional: although Lee hasn't done a straight-up musical since \"School Daze,\" his movies often tilt in that direction. This one dives into it headfirst\u2014starting with the dazzling opening credits sequence, which sees dancer Charles \"Li'L Buck\" Riley gliding, twisting, spiraling and twirling across an array of Red Hook, Brooklyn locations\u2014and keeps it going through a gospel performance late in the movie in which Black American Christianity gets pulled into the film's matrix of addiction and transcendence.\u00a0 It's impossible to say what, exactly, Lee had in\u00a0mind when he undertook this project, but whether you like the result or not, you damn sure know you've seen something not quite like anything else (including its inspiration), made with a sense of passionate engagement.\u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Lovers and the Despot", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "A frustrating missed opportunity, \"The Lovers and the Despot\" takes a fascinating story about filmmaking, politics, kidnapping and propaganda and gives us almost no insight into the work of its two main characters, a director and his actress wife. Their personalities come through loud and clear, but the artistic and political context in which their amazing story occurred barely gets illuminated\u2014a particular shame given that North and South Korean cinema and politics are subjects than many Americans know almost nothing about, save for the vague oversimplifications they might have overheard on the news on the rare occasions when US media outlets deign to cover that part of the world. Advertisement Written and directed by Ross Adam and Robert Cannan, the film marshals a staggering array of material to tell us about one of the strangest stories in international film history. In 1978, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il, the titular despot and also a movie buff, decided that North Korean films were boring and resolved to import top talent from the South, which made superior motion pictures. So he kidnapped Choi Eun-hee, wife and sometime leading lady of producer-director Shin Sang-ok, a giant of South Korean cinema in the 1950s and '60s, and used her as bait to lure the actress' husband to Hong Kong, where he, too, was kidnapped. The couple was then forcibly relocated to Korea, where the dictator gave Shin nearly unlimited resources to make any kinds of films he wanted as long as they portrayed North Korea, mortal enemy of Shin's home country, in a favorable light. It's an astonishing tale that either illustrates the realities of Stockholm Syndrome or the moral cravenness of artists whose values can easily be compromised by a powerful person writing them a fat check. There are many more fascinating details in this story, and the filmmakers flesh out the personal parts of it via newspaper clippings, TV news snippets, abstract footage that might or might not be recreations (the movie is pretty coy about that stuff) and interviews with most of the main participants and many side players; the latter includes a sit-down with a South Korean intelligence agent involved in the case, as well as a conversation with Shin's brother Choi Kyung-Ok, who describes his sibling as an artist who was aces with actors and camera equipment but a disaster as a businessman. Shin's company, Shin Films, made over 300 movies but collapsed anyway due to mismanagement. \"Shin had zero talent for running a company, zero,\" his brother says.  By the time the North Korean government engineered the forced relocation of Shin and Choi, the pair were already kaput as a couple, having divorced after Shin had two children with a younger actress. They spent eight years in North Korea and made eight films there before plotting a daring escape to the west in 1986. Their arrival is captured in TV news footage that opens the movie; the rest of their story is structured as an extended flashback, building toward to their escape in the manner of a heist film or \"Argo.\"  Advertisement All of this is fairly well-done, if a bit structurally cliched\u2014too many modern documentaries strive to ape the conventions of fictional genre movies, to the point where they seem slightly embarrassed to be documentaries in the first place\u2014but the attention paid to the emotional mechanics of Choi and Shin's relationship and the particulars of the escape has the odd effect of Hollywood-izing a story that's culturally very specific, and that should be able to fascinate on its own terms. Throughout, footage from Shin's films is deployed not to give us insight into his artistry or his personal temperament, but to serve as \"dramatizations\" of real events. For instance, Shin's brother talks about how creditors would come by and intimidate the production company when they were behind on payments, and we see shots from a Shin film of a lone hero facing down a group of goons. But we don't know what film the clip is from\u2014the directors never give us so much as a title when they throw a scene onscreen, let alone a sense of what, exactly, we're looking at, and what it means apart from the odd story of Shin and Choi and Kim Jong-Il.  Fairly or not, the film consistently gives the impression that it's uninterested in the work of the artists whose personal stories it chronicles, except as a way of illustrating various witnesses' anecdotes. If this were a ten-minute TV news magazine segment aimed at an audience that had no idea North and South Korea even had film industries, you could probably understand that approach; but the failure to engage with the artistry of these artists makes the story seem less complex and rich than it might've been. The personalities are big, the story is striking, but the treatment is unimaginative\u2014except for the editing, which is often clever and beautiful but problematic.  The movie is at its best in throwaway moments, such as the bit where the South Korean intelligence agent talks about Kim Jong-Il's movie obsession and the documentary cuts to an audio snippet of the dictator complaining about the sorry state of his nation's cinema: \"Why do all of our films have the same ideological plots? There's nothing new about them. Why are there so many crying scenes? This isn't a funeral.\"", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Working from a beloved 1978 children's book by Judi and Ron Barrett that had virtually no plot, 2009's \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" was a pleasant surprise for kids and parents. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller not only assembled one of the most likable voice casts of that year but cleverly worked relatable themes of personal expression, parental acceptance, and even a sweet romance into a tale in which cheeseburgers fall from the sky and gummy bears can be deadly.   Returning to Swallow Falls in the inevitable sequel (not at all based on the Barrett's literary follow-up, \"Pickles to Pittsburgh\"), the creators of \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2\" retain enough of the imaginative energy of their predecessor to keep little ones engaged but they fall victim to the common trap of animated sequels, believing that the driving creative principle has to be more, More, MORE. The food doesn't just fall from the sky this time, it moves, breathes, and develops its own ecosystem. The result is a film in which the environment, the \"Foodimals,\" end up more interesting than the characters or story.  Advertisement In a brief recap to open the sequel, we're reminded that Flint Lockwood's (Bill Hader) \"FLDSMDFR\" (\"Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator\") was lost at the end of the first film, leaving everyone with a happy ending but what looked like a heck of a lot of clean-up work. Flint is awestruck when his idol, a creative titan known as Chester V (Will Forte), head of the revolutionary tech company Live Corp, descends on Swallow Falls and not only offers to help in the clean-up efforts going on around the world but wants to work with Flint.  Lockwood, his girlfriend Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), and dad Tim (James Caan) head off to San Franjose, where Flint becomes a cog in Chester's highly-competitive machine, a tech operation where there's a caffeine station every ten feet and monitors display motivational platitudes from the company leader. The spoofing of the tech industry's over-caffeinated, over-competitive atmosphere by writers John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein, and Erica Rivinoja is clever but will likely go over the heads of most kids and register as kind of slight for the older ones.  Of course, the clearly malevolent Chester V, aided by an ape with a human brain named Barb (Kristen Schaal), has sinister motives. He wants the FLDSMDFR and he knows Flint is the only one who can get it for him. Chester convinces Flint that Swallow Falls has become overrun by deadly creatures that are half-food, half-animals. Vicious \"Cheesespiders\" (cheeseburger-shaped spiders) roam the island, even killing off most of the Live Corp. employees who have gone to help the clean-up effort. With his knowledge of how all of this chaos started in the first place, Flint is the only one who can save the island. He's like Ian Malcolm in \"The Lost World,\" headed back to the chaos, and the visual cues to the Steven Spielberg series, complete with a stampede of giant bananas are pretty transparent. Replace the Raptors with Cheesespiders and the T. Rex with a giant taco.  Advertisement Of course, there are no lone heroes in kid's movies and the writers and new directors Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn can't miss the chance to get the beloved characters from the first movie back to help Flint on his journey. The lovely Sam and gruff pop join forces with Flint's monkey Steve (Neil Patrick Harris), Officer Earl (Terry Crews, replacing Mr. T from the first film), and even Chicken Brent (Andy Samberg) and cameraman Manny (Benjamin Bratt). Can friendship and teamwork tackle an island of \"Flamangoes\" and \"Shrimpanzees\"?   I wish \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2\" answered that question. It's not a film about friendship and teamwork as it is a film about marshmallows with faces. \"Cloudy 2\" is undeniably dense with ideas, images, and characters but slight on anything of thematic interest at all. The first movie was about a kid obsessed with science and ostracized from his society learning that he had a place in it. The second movie is about an admittedly adorable, talking strawberry. The characters of \"Cloudy 2\" are almost non-existent, turning into devices to get viewers to the next visual \"ooh\" moment. Yes, a lot of those visual moments are creative but this film simply lacks the heart of the first one, becoming a series of interesting set pieces more than an engaging story.  It's not through lack of trying on the part of the voice cast, who are uniformly strong. Hader and Faris have an energy that most animated films lack and they're accompanied well by Caan, Forte, and Schaal. Finding the right actors to voice the characters is a crucial and often under-valued element in animation and a lot of the success of \"Cloudy\" came back to the way Hader and Faris didn't phone in their work in the slightest, making Flint and Sam characters who were easy to root for. This time, the script doesn't give them enough time to work creatively other than to respond to what's around them but the cast can't be blamed for that.  Advertisement It comes down to point of comparison. Holding this film up against its wildly inventive predecessor shows its flaws and yet it retains enough of that movie's creative spark that it's hard to dismiss when compared to the other films that clutter the animated marketplace. The world of \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2\" is a cleverly-conceived one, the design of the film is engaging on all levels, and the voice cast is great. It's the story that fails to engage beyond the glittering surface. Maybe they should try \"Pickles to Pittsburgh\" next time.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Downsizing", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Alexander Payne's \"Downsizing\" starts with an intriguing \"What if?...\", the launch pad of all good sci-fi stories, and very quickly devolves into a bland story about a nondescript khaki-wearing guy who learns to care about the less fortunate. It's the least interesting way to go with what is a pretty interesting premise. The Nebraska born-and-raised Payne has always been interested in the Everyman, the regular guy caught up in extraordinary circumstances, but in \"Downsizing,\" the possibilities of the imaginative scenario are mostly abandoned for this other totally banal theme. Good sci-fi works on its own terms, setting up the \"rules\" of the alternate world, and then carrying these rules out to their farthest reaching conclusions. How would one technological change affect humanity? How would consciousness itself change if such-and-such became possible? \"Downsizing\" is interested, sort of, in those types of questions, but the clich\u00e9s have proven irresistible. Advertisement The film takes place in an era not too far in the future when a group of scientists in Norway have figured out a way to shrink human beings into five-inch-tall versions of themselves. The discovery is hailed as a revolution and a possible answer to the climate change emergency. If human beings take up less space, create less of a carbon footprint, make less trash, then perhaps the planet can be saved. Within a couple of years, \"downsizing\"\u2014as the procedure is called\u2014has swept the planet. \"Downsized\" communities crop up everywhere, with governments giving tax credit incentives to those who choose to go small. An Omaha-based occupational therapist named Paul (Matt Damon) and his aspirational wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig) wonder if they should \"go small\" after chatting with some friends who took the leap. Paul's friend Dave (Jason Sudeikis) sits perched on a box of cookies on the kitchen counter, telling Paul\u2014who hovers over him like a giant\u2014how great it is to live a life of leisure with no financial worries. The biggest problem Paul and Audrey have in their lives is that they want a bigger house but can't afford it. (Welcome to the club, Paul and Audrey.) They decide to go for it, applying for a spot at Leisureland, a \"downsized\" community in New Mexico, hyped up to hopeful applicants with a promotional video starring married couple Jeff and Laura Lonowski (Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern), both wearing ear-mikes, doing marital \"banter\" in their echoing McMansion the size of a dollhouse about how awesome life is once you go small. The \"downsizing\" process is shown in intriguing detail, and make up the best sequences in the film. They're imaginative and funny and detailed. People's gold teeth must be removed, otherwise their heads would explode during downsizing. All body hair is removed, too. These details support a logical universe (it would have been funny to see some of the disastrous early attempts to \"go small,\" a tiny man trailing a beard 20 miles long, etc.) When Paul wakes up in the recovery rooms of Leisureland, he learns that Audrey backed out at the last minute. (Unfortunately that also means Wiig has exited the movie.) Paul now must make it through Smallville on his own. His party-hound Eurotrash upstairs neighbor Dusan Mirkovic (Christoph Waltz, doing his typical schtick) tries to get him to have some fun with being small. Paul instead is drawn to Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau), Dusan's Vietnamese cleaning lady (whose escape to America in a television box caused an international incident.) Advertisement Through Ngoc Lan, Paul learns of the darker side of Leisureland, its rigid and racist class system, the built-in haves and have nots of our world make up Leisureland too. Ngoc Lan lives in a rundown tenement complex outside the \"Truman Show\" walls of Leisureland. She takes care of everyone, bringing food to the hungry, medicine to the sick. She enlists Paul's help in this. She will not take No for an answer. Paul is drawn along, against his will, into a world where helping other people\u2014because it's the right thing to do\u2014is the norm. There are a lot of problems with all of this. Because Ngoc Lan is such a strong character, and Chau is so funny and strident and bossy, she takes over the entire film. Easily. Matt Damon doesn't stand a chance. This may be the whole point, but it makes for really unbalanced viewing. Every \"Everyman\" needs to have some \"oomph\" of his own if he is going to occupy the center of a film. He is our \"way in.\" We see the extraordinary world through his eyes. George Bailey in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is the ultimate \"Everyman,\" and his journey from depressive resentful sacrifice to the redemption of human belonging is still searingly powerful today, because he seems like a real man, we can identify strongly with his experiences. But Paul in \"Downsizing\" barely registers onscreen. Normally I dislike it when people say \"It would have been a better movie if this interesting side character had been the lead character instead\" because there's no guarantee that it would be a better movie. But here, it's so clear that almost everyone onscreen\u2014Dusan, Ngoc Lan, even the lost wife Audrey\u2014is a more interesting and fleshed-out character than generic Paul. As an Everyman, Paul is a dud. The premise of \"Downsizing\" has some similarities to Ari Folman's great 2014 film \"The Congress,\" which also takes place in a future close enough to our own it sets off disturbing echoes. In \"The Congress,\" technology can turn human beings into their own avatars, unleashing infinite computer-generated and cartoon doppelgangers, so that the \"original\" is completely lost in the replications. Through technology, humanity has chosen obsolescence. Unlike \"Downsizing,\" though, \"The Congress\" pushes its initial premise into the outer reaches of possibility (so far out there that the entire second half of the film is animated). In taking its premise so seriously, in exploring the emotional ramifications of said premise, \"The Congress\" is a piercing cry of mourning for humanity's follies, for the mistakes we have made, for how carelessly we have treated the gifts we have been given. Paul, delivering trays of food to the Leisureland poor, just doesn't cut it. But at least \"Downsizing\" features Udo Kier as a five-inch-tall retired sea captain. That's something you don't see everyday. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cHe\u2019s as ugly as sin\u2014literally!\u201d A high-school teacher of mine once made that clever observation with respect to the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, and it came to mind as I gazed upon the controversial contemporary French writer Michel Houellebecq playing himself in the 2014 film \u201cThe Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq.\u201d Sitting in his kitchen consulting a designer about a renovation (he is a writer of sufficient market power that he can re-do his apartment), wearing a ridiculous blue-striped v-neck shirt, weakly holding a cigarette, and tilting his misshapen strawberry head, a relaxed expression on his seemingly always scrunched-up face, Houellebecq, whose novelistic output has been sufficiently incendiary to compel him to spend several years off the Continent, has an air both repellent and possibly innocuous. A brand of anti-charisma, if you will.\u00a0 Advertisement This movie, written and directed by Guillame Nicloux (himself a novelist as well as a filmmaker) was inspired by an AWOL-type period in Houellebecq\u2019s actual life, in the year 2011, during which he was reputed to have been abducted. The author himself has declined to confirm his abduction, but it wouldn\u2019t be the only excitation in his biography, given that he\u2019s been tried in his home country for inciting racial hatred and such. While this movie doesn\u2019t strive to portray the Houellebecq With A Song In His Heart, it does show the author as a man of small, tetchy multitudes; one minute he\u2019s nervously declining a cab ride upon discovering the driver appears to be North African (although is that the real reason? We never really know); the next he\u2019s gently embracing and bantering with a friend who\u2019s a woman of color. Combined with his low-key affect, these vignettes convince us that even literary provocateurs have ordinary lives.\u00a0 But Houellebecq\u2019s ordinary life will soon be rocked by three knucklehead bros, one of whom has been set off by, of all things, one of the author\u2019s earliest works, a study of American horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. The fellows\u2014one fat, the other two trim, one of those a mixed martial arts maven\u2014abduct the writer at his own flat, and carry the tiny fellow out in a small steel cabinet. They bring him out to their ancestral home out in the provinces\u2014the kind of staid but seething-with-ennui setting in which Maurice Pialat might set a film.\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t smoked in ages,\u201d Houellebecq lies to his captors as they acclimate him to his new surroundings while trying to convince him that they\u2019re working for a mastermind\u2014they don\u2019t even really have much of an idea of how to demand a ransom, or from whom, as it turns out. The aforementioned anti-charisma is, alchemically, wielded by Houellebecq as a way of wheedling favors out of his captors. Soon enough, the author is dining with them, drinking with them, debating the sexual orientation of J.R.R. Tolkien with them. He also gets the opportunity to elaborate on some of his more volatile positions, particularly Europe and its history, as for instance when he holds forth as to why Poland is really only \u201chalf a country\u201d if at all. The fiction of the film has the effect of illuminating Houellebecq while also, in a sense, diminishing him: here he is not a widely translated and frequently published author propagating Highly Objectionable Stances, but just some old dude saying some unusual stuff. So, okay then.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cFragile guy,\u201d one of the hapless criminals observes of Houllebecq when they first snag him, but while he\u2019s not physically imposing, he nevertheless proves a formidable and perverse social chess player, particularly when he convinces the lady of the house to procure a prostitute for him! That character, named Fatima, provides the most bleakly Pialat-esque note to the film; \u201cshe does other odd jobs,\u201d someone observes of her status in town. The existential trap implied by the character gives the movie\u2019s odd final scene a particularly apt resonance.\u00a0 The main caveat I have is that this isn\u2019t a film that\u2019s going to mean a whole lot to a viewer who\u2019s never heard of Houllebecq, who\u2019s indeed pretty well known in the States but not as the cultural fixture he is in France. A lot of the film\u2019s most potent jokes are also very Francophilic, as when Houllebecq complains that all the books in the house where he\u2019s held are by Alain Minc. (I had to look him up myself, to be honest.) And even those with The Knowledge might be put off by the movie\u2019s discursive, loose, dry style. I dug it myself, and Nicloux is a very confident practitioner of the mode. Let\u2019s just say that this is pretty much the opposite of a contemporary American comedy: rather than broad, \u201cThe Kidnapping of Michel Houllebecq\u201d is an exemplary example of narrow.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Run All Night", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Ditching the twisting high concepts of works like \u201cUnknown\u201d\r\n(amnesia!) and \u201cNon-Stop\u201d (one flight!), action star Liam Neeson and director Jaume\r\nCollet-Serra have crafted their most satisfying work to date by sticking to a\r\ntried-and-true crime movie template, and allowing a talented cast and tight\r\nproduction values to be the only high concept they need. \u201cRun All Night\u201d isn\u2019t\r\nperfect, but it\u2019s surprisingly satisfying on its own terms, elevated by a\r\nbetter-than-average ensemble and some razor-sharp editing to cut through any\r\nnagging questions about the plot. More than he\u2019s been allowed to do in either\r\nCollet-Serra vehicle before this one, Neeson gets to portray a real character\r\nhere, a man who may have once had a particular set of skills but has seen then\r\ndulled by age, regret and whiskey. \u201cRun All Night\u201d is proof that quality action\r\nfilms don\u2019t really need to reinvent the wheel each time out as long as they\r\nmake it spin this smoothly. Advertisement Jimmy Conlon (Neeson) used to be a notorious mob enforcer.\r\nIf he knocked on your door, you knew you were in trouble. Rumored to be behind\r\nover a dozen murders at the behest of the infamous Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris),\r\nConlon doesn\u2019t have much left to live for. He\u2019s the guy who wakes up in the bar\r\nthe next morning and just starts drinking again, forced to beg Shawn\u2019s son\r\nDanny (Boyd Holbrook) for money and drunkenly play Santa Claus at the Maguire\r\nChristmas party. The man who once was feared is now openly mocked by a younger,\r\ntougher generation of bad guys. Jimmy also lost all touch with his son Mike\r\n(Joel Kinnaman), who is trying to live a straight life as a limo driver with\r\nhis wife (Genesis Rodriguez) and two kids (with a third on the way).  The first act of \u201cRun All Night\u201d is really the arc of two\r\nsons\u2014one trying to get away from the criminal underworld and one diving as\r\ndeeply as possible into it. As Danny, the very talented Boyd Holbrook is all twitchy, nervous energy, the kind of dangerous sociopath who seems\r\ncapable of doing whatever it takes to gain the respect of his father through\r\ncriminal notoriety. To that end, he brings heroin into their world. Dad says\r\nno, but Albanian heroin dealers don\u2019t like to be pushed out of a possible\r\ncriminal enterprise. It just so happens that the dealers hire Mike to drive\r\nthem to a meeting with Danny that goes horribly awry. Before you know it, Danny\r\nis dead, and Mike is a target of everybody in the criminal underworld, including\r\na high-priced assassin played with effective cool by Common, and only his estranged\r\ndad can keep him safe till morning. Neeson does arguably the best work of his action career here\r\nin that he captures a man who doesn\u2019t just pop to life as a killing machine\r\nagain but has the muscle memory to get the job done one last time. Jimmy may\r\nstumble through subway tunnels but he can still choke a man out and fire a\r\nperfect shot when he needs to. And the actor rises above the potential clich\u00e9 of\r\nthe criminal redemption arc in the way he doesn\u2019t allow the potential melodrama\r\nto sink into his portrayal. His take on Jimmy is a man doing what needs to be\r\ndone, not necessarily to right the wrongs of the past but because there\u2019s\r\nnothing else he can do at this point. And watching Neeson and Harris in scenes\r\ntogether, especially a great, tense meeting in the middle of the piece, is a\r\nsurprising joy. They\u2019re both great here in that neither overplays the hero or\r\nvillain archetype. Jimmy, the good guy, is a murderer, while Shawn, the bad guy, is emotionally mourning the loss of his child. They are far more complex than they would have been in the hands of other\r\nactors. Advertisement \u201cRun All Night\u201d is also subtly elevated by a top-notch team\r\nbehind the camera, especially editor Craig McKay, a two-time Oscar nominee for \u201cReds\u201d\r\nand \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201d For at least an hour, \u201cRun All Night\u201d hums\u2014to be fair, there\u2019s\r\na bit of a sag in the middle and the entire piece runs too long at nearly two\r\nhours. But take note of the way McKay and Collet-Serra orchestrate a great sequence\r\nin a subway station, creating a rhythm between the cops trying to find Mike and\r\nthe bad guys coming after Jimmy. Or look at the great car chase scene, which is\r\nshot in a bit too much close-up (as are a few of the fights), but has a\r\nvisceral pace to it that makes it impossible to look away. Or watch one of the final sequences in a train yard and the way it perfectly fits together to build tension. There\u2019s a tempo to \u201cRun\r\nAll Night\u201d that really serves as the entertaining foundation of the whole film,\r\nand it\u2019s what so many boring action films lack. Some of \u201cRun All Night\u201d doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense and I\r\nwished for a little more grit and a little less polish in some of its darker\r\nbeats (although viewers should be warned that this piece doesn\u2019t shy away from\r\nextreme violence at times). There\u2019s also a fine line between entertainment and\r\nbeing a bit too on-the-nose when you choose to set a shoot-out in an Irish bar\r\nto The Pogues, but the film had won me over by that point.

{"Title": "White God", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Imagine an \"R\" rated \"Lassie\" by way of \"Spartacus.\" That's Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3's \"White God,\" a brutal but stirring fantasy about street dogs rising up against cruel and indifferent humans.  Between its (faked) animal-on-animal and human-on-animal violence, harsh language, sexual situations and casual drug use, this Hungarian drama is definitely not for children. And yet it plugs into some of the same feelings of childlike awe and terror that make classic animal pictures (including monster movies) so memorable. \"Old Yeller,\" \"E.T.,\" \"Black Beauty,\" \"King Kong\"\u2014there are bits of all of them in the DNA of \"White God,\" but the film is its own amazing thing. From its opening flash-forward of its 13-year old heroine, Lili (Zsofia Psotta), cycling down an eerily empty street amid a wave of masterless canines to its numerous, wordless images of the world as seen through a dog's eyes, the film has a rare sense of the fairy-tale uncanny. It doesn't always hang together\u2014its attempts to parallel the life of its mistreated, misunderstood and often neglected heroine and her beloved dog Hagen don't always make storytelling sense, mainly because the dog simply has it worse. But Mundrucz\u00f3 and his filmmaking team get the basics so right that the movie's missteps don't matter much. Owing less to contemporary Hollywood films than to broad-brushstrokes silent-era melodramas, this is an image-and-sound driven example of purely cinematic storytelling. Throughout much of its running time, it achieves a dreamlike, sometimes nightmarish power.\u00a0  Advertisement Lili is a child of divorce whose college professor mother leaves town to pursue a job opportunity for several months, leaving her in the care of her father Daniel (Sandor Zsoter), a slaughterhouse inspector who's first seen overseeing the evisceration of a dead cow. This gory sequence sets up the movie's world view: humans arrogantly carry themselves as if they have unquestioned dominion over all of nature, especially animals. They treat their fellow mammals as property while occasionally paying lip service to the idea that they're caretakers and companions. The blood flowing across the slaughterhouse floor psychically tints the whole movie. It says, \"Society \r\ntreats all animals as meat\u2014and even if you think you're not part of that\r\n mentality, you probably are.\" Daniel is an impatient and in some ways petty man. He barely tolerates his daughter's love for Hagen, and is deeply uncomfortable with letting the animal live with them in an apartment building that forbids unregistered street pets. (Hagen is a mixed-breed street dog who can't be kept legally anyway, unless Daniel pays a tax and gets a proper license.) When a nosy neighbor reports Hagen to animal control, \"White God\" turns into a harrowing tale of separation and reconciliation\u2014a love story of sorts that explicitly invokes Richard Wagner's opera \"Tannh\u00e4user\" in scenes where Lili plays trumpet in a high school orchestra overseen by an arrogant teacher-conductor. Over the course of the film, Hagen wanders the streets alone, dodges cars and forages for food, and eventually ends up being captured and brutally conditioned as a fighting dog before escaping to try to find his way back to his human friend (calling Lili an \"owner\" seems at odds with the movie's spirit). But although the simple plot is articulated with great clarity, this is mainly a film of moments. And what moments! Mundrucz\u00f3's and his cinematographer Marcell Rev shoot Lili and Hagen's story with a documentary-like immediacy, following much of the action with a handheld widescreen camera that's often placed at ground level, the better to show harsh urban landscapes through a dog's eyes. The cutting, by David Jancso, is fast, sometimes choppy and deliberately disorienting, to make us think that animals are actually fighting or suffering when what really we're seeing is cinematic sleight-of-hand.  Advertisement But despite all these \"gritty\" affectations, the movie's tone is defiantly old-fashioned. The human characters are clearly defined as moral or immoral based on how much empathy they show towards animals. The movie approves or condemns them based on whether they treat the movie's street dogs as fellow beings, with feelings and inherent rights, or as property, or nuisances, or menaces to order.  The comparison to Stanley Kubrick's \"Spartacus\" is not offered lightly. \"White God\" is\r\n a slave revolt film in girl-and-her-dog drag, with Hagen as our \r\nintrepid hero and surrogate\u2014much more so than Lili, who's appealing but never in as much immediate physical danger. We don't just want Hagen to escape his \r\ntormentors, the worst of whom is a dogfighting trainer who drugs him, \r\ntortures him and trains him to kill other dogs; we want him to seek \r\nrevenge for humankind's collective crimes against his species\u2014and we may not have thought of them as crimes until Mundrucz\u00f3 script laid them out for us, in a series of coolly observed, elegantly choreographed, often devastating set-pieces.  A brief interlude that shows Hagen being leashed and then sold by a \r\nhomeless man drives home the idea of a ingrained and mostly unquestioned\r\n humans-above-animals hierarchy. The man is living in squalor and can \r\nbarely feed himself, but he won't recognize the \"humanity,\" such as it \r\nis, in the dog, because Hagen is \"just\" a dog\u2014a resource to be turned \r\naround for a bit of money and a hot meal. An early scene of Hagen and other wild dogs being rousted by noose-toting animal control officers in a junkyard evokes Kubrick's Roman epic, as well as a \"human roundup\" scene in the original \"Planet of the Apes,\" which was itself a not-too-subtle parable about slavery and bigotry. The dogfighting scenes are essentially gladiatorial arena scenes. There's an extraordinary moment where Hagen, who's forced to kill a fellow canine in combat, regards the body with what seems like moral revulsion. The scene is just a bag of editing 101 tricks\u2014shot \"A\" plus shot \"B\" equals idea \"C\"\u2014but it's sensationally effective because it's so unfussy and direct. It puts across the idea that Hagen is disgusted by what he's become, and furious at the conditions that pushed him to this point.   The use of classical music, including generous swaths of Wagner, is bold, and it's key to the film's magic; it confirms that \"White God\" is an unabashedly mythic melodrama that's always chasing the big moment, the grand gesture, the overwhelming feeling. When Mundrucz\u00f3 cuts from a dog fight to a shot of escaped dog running down a dark street, the camera tracking ahead of him at pooch-level, the drums pound and the string section swells, and you can feel your heart race. What's wrong will be made right.   Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Jane", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Biographical documentaries of famous people are typically dull affairs, the kind of thing that falls into hagiography or the kind of talking-head, then-this-happened adoration more at home in the 60-minute television format on PBS than in a feature film. There are very few filmmakers who have defied this trend as completely as Brett Morgen, the director of \u201cKurt Cobain: Montage of Heck\u201d and \u201cThe Kid Stays in the Picture\u201d (about Robert Evans). He makes films that feel like extensions of his subject matters, channeling their creative spirit in the form of his filmmaking more than just detailing what happened in their lives. So it\u2019s cinematic justice that over a hundred hours of footage of Jane Goodall crossed paths with Brett Morgen, as both are pioneers in their field, and only Morgen seems capable of shaping that footage in such a unique, captivating, inspiring way as in \u201cJane,\u201d one of the best documentaries of the year so far. Advertisement \u201cJane\u201d is that rare documentary that works in equal measure for those who know a great deal about Jane Goodall and those people who don\u2019t know a thing. Most people probably think they know all they need to know about Jane Goodall. She watched chimps, right? Her research was essential to understanding not only the way we interact with the natural world but our place in it, but hers is not a name like Kurt Cobain that gets thrown around in conversations much in 2017. \u201cJane\u201d fully elevates the scientific pedestal on which Jane Goodall should be placed but it does so in part by humanizing her, revealing the challenges she faced and discoveries she made as more than mere National Geographic footage you might see in a Science class.    Morgen structures his film relatively chronologically, allowing Goodall to tell her own story as we see footage of her in the wild. There\u2019s a fascinating structural element of \u201cJane\u201d in that the footage doesn\u2019t contain interviews or dialogue, and so we\u2019re watching Jane, the chimps, and the other humans who would come to Gambe, in a way that\u2019s not dissimilar from the way Goodall observed her subjects. And there\u2019s the added sense of disconnected observation that comes with time, and in the manner that Goodall herself is analyzing her own story in the way that someone might analyze the actions of a family of chimps. The parallel is clearly intentional, especially as \u201cJane\u201d becomes more and more about how the lessons that Goodall learned in the wild informed her entire life, including even teaching her lessons about motherhood.    That\u2019s a theme of \u201cJane\u201d as we\u2019re introduced to Goodall\u2019s supportive mother in the opening scenes, see how Jane observes the motherhood of the chimps she\u2019s studying, and then see her maternal instincts on display with her own child. Morgen very subtly does this in his films\u2014drawing thematic undercurrents that move through the work without overriding the informative chronology of it all. There\u2019s a fluidity that can be breathtaking to watch, especially as that motion is accompanied by Philip Glass\u2019 best film score in years. You should be warned that it\u2019s \u201cvery Glass,\u201d and I found it somewhat overwhelming at first, but I quickly couldn\u2019t imagine the film working without it. It becomes an essential part of the film because of the aforementioned lack of an abundance of archival interviews, meaning that Goodall\u2019s modern voice and Glass\u2019 compositions become our primary sources for information and inspiration.    Advertisement \u201cJane\u201d is filled with fascinating anecdotes and insights, such as the fact that Goodall was never nervous about going to the wild to observe chimps because we didn\u2019t really know about the aggression of the species when she chose to do so. She didn\u2019t know to be scared (but would learn about the violence inherent in the chimp population). Goodall made headlines around the world when she filmed a chimp using a branch to obtain termites from a hole for nourishment. It may not seem like a big deal now, but it was once thought that humans were the only species to use tools, and the fact that a chimp used a branch as a tool shook the world, especially in the offices of religious leaders. The footage around the first time that Goodall really made contact with the chimps\u2014when they trusted her enough to get close\u2014is still breathtaking. It\u2019s incredible to consider that footage this old of a chimp taking a banana from a woman for the first time ever would make for one of the most unforgettable scenes of 2017. A baby chimp learning how to walk is on that list of 2017 images I won\u2019t forget as well.    Goodall herself is a forthcoming and fascinating interview subject\u2014another testament to Morgen\u2019s work as a narrator. \u201cJane\u201d feels like a film that couldn\u2019t have been made without the valuable insight gained through time. We see so many documentaries that want to be current and timely that they don\u2019t realize the value of chronological distance from a subject. In a sense, we\u2019re watching the impact of Goodall\u2019s evolution from a young adventurer to a groundbreaking scientist to a wife and mother. And it\u2019s through her self-analysis of that evolution that Morgen draws a line through fifty years of research and an entirely different species. As he has in his other films, he\u2019s saying to us that it is through these pioneers that we can see the best in ourselves and the potential of the human intellect and desire to learn. But he never loses his filmmaker\u2019s desire to entertain at the same time. It\u2019s that balance of both\u2014the genius of both the subject and the filmmaker\u2014that make \u201cJane\u201d such a rewarding experience.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Divine Order", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "It is perhaps no accident that the heroine of this story of women\u2019s liberation in early 1970\u2019s Switzerland is named Nora. The legendary proto-feminist heroine of Ibsen\u2019s 19th-century drama walked out of her doll\u2019s house about 100 years before the Nora of this movie walks out on her husband, two sons, and borderline abusive father in law.\u00a0 The Nora of this film, written and directed by Petra Volpe, doesn\u2019t seem likely to leave forever. Despite the elevation of consciousness that takes place throughout this movie, her bond to her husband Hans and her two kids is strong. The most pleasurable part of watching this Nora\u2019s story is seeing how the males in her life have to make room for her, and do some learning themselves.\u00a0 Advertisement The movie opens with a montage of social unrest from late \u201860s America. Interesting to think that this country was importing socially conscious rebellion fifty years ago, huh? A female narrator\u2019s voice (Nora\u2019s, we\u2019ll later figure out) tells of how thrilling it was to hear of such phenomena as Woodstock, and then observes that life in a rural Swiss village was a little dull by comparison. Livening things up was a referendum to allow women the right to vote.\u00a0 Played with confidence and understatement by Marie Leuenberger, Nora at first seems a relatively obedient, complaisant if not complacent housewife. She and her matinee-idol handsome husband Hans are often apt to visit the farm on which Hans\u2019s brother Werner, who\u2019s married to Nora\u2019s older sister Therese, is failing to thrive, much to the consternation of the aforementioned nasty father-in-law, who constantly lectures the family on its shortcomings, expresses his general disgust with the womenfolk therein, and keeps sex tabloids under his bed\u2019s pillow. Nora reveals herself as an unusually tolerant and good-hearted family member by earning the trust of Therese\u2019s rebellious teen daughter Hanna, who promptly betrays that trust by running off to Zurich with a ne\u2019er-do-well boyfriend on a trip to town with Nora. It\u2019s during that trip to town that Nora gets her first taste of feminism: some women handing out pamphlets on the vote referendum practically weigh Nora down with feminist literature, including a German translation of a vital Betty Friedan book. Hans is away for compulsory military training, so she reads her new stuff as well as a copy of Switzerland\u2019s marriage act, just to make sure Hans is telling the truth when he insists that she can\u2019t get a part-time job without his explicit permission.\u00a0 An admission of disagreement with her town\u2019s resident Phyllis Schlafly-like anti-feminist attracts the notice of an older woman, Vroni, who says that she was the only woman in town to support suffrage last time it was on the ballot in Switzerland, in 1959. The two women venture to a defunct pub that Vroni lost after her husband\u2019s death, and discover an Italian immigrant, Graziella, preparing to transform the joint into a pizzeria.\u00a0 The younger women get new hairstyles and go on a shopping spree. Soon more join them, and they\u2019re running off to Zurich to march in demonstrations and sit in on a talk from a female sex guru who talks about honoring one\u2019s own vagina and dropping the knowledge to Nora that she has a tiger between her legs. When Hans gets home, he meets a very different wife.\u00a0 He is not entirely pleased. And neither are the rest of the town\u2019s men, becoming even more agitated when a large group of women go on strike, holing up in Graziella\u2019s place and refusing to do housework until the vote is taken.\u00a0 This is a conventional but exceptionally warm crowd-pleaser of a movie, mostly thanks to Leuenberger\u2019s performance. Her Nora is a shyer creature than many groundbreaking feminists of cinema, but Leuenberger makes this personality trait feel genuine, a real part of her character rather than a sop to make her rebellion more palatable to male viewers. Her desire to keep her family together persists even in her reasonable demands that she be accommodated as an actual, contributing, equal component of it. She\u2019s definitely a performer to watch.

But it\u2019s definitely the kind of movie that works the name of a classic rock song into its title and makes sure to blast it during the end credits, so that people who were in their twenties during the 1990s and now have kids of their own (and probably took them to this film) can feel that Pavlovian tingle.\u00a0 Advertisement That description makes the new \u201cJumanji\u201d sound like a cash-grab, and in lot of ways it is\u2014studios are so enamored with the notion that pre-existing intellectual properties are box office insurance that they\u2019re far more likely to greenlight this than something genuinely new, even though exactly no one has spent the last two decades saying, \u201cI wish somebody would make another \u2018Jumanji.\u2019\u201d At the same time, though, this is a\u00a0likable, funny diversion, and sometimes more than that. It has enough twists and surprises to pull viewers along, despite the fact that writer-director Jake Kasdan\u2019s story (co-written with four people) is ultimately not much meatier than the one from a 1990s videogame that the characters end up inhabiting after getting sentenced to a \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d-type detention at school. (In the original film, the titular diversion is an old-fashioned board game, just like in the source material, Chris van Allsburg\u2019s popular children\u2019s book.) The protagonists here are\u00a0Spencer (Alex Wolff), an earnest nerd; Spencer\u2019s onetime best friend Fridge (Ser\u2019Darius Blain), a football star who ends up grounded after authorities realize Alex wrote a homework assignment for him; Bethany (Madison Iseman), a classic snotty Heather-type who\u2019s addicted to her smartphone and takes selfies constantly; and the bookish, socially anxious Martha (Morgan Turner). They all have insecurities and issues. Once they end up inside the Jumanji videogame, these same characters are played by Dwayne Johnson (as Spencer the nerd); Kevin Hart (as Fridge the jock); Karen Gillan (as the super-fit avatar of Martha), and Jack Black, of all people, as Bethany. There are supposed to be five characters in the game-space, though, and we meet the fifth in due time: Alex Vreeke (Nick Jonas), who is introduced as an energetic teenager in the film\u2019s 1996 prologue, only to get sucked into the game and become The Local Missing Boy whose endlessly grieving family still lives in their now-decrepit house.\u00a0 The body-switching gag threatens to wear out its welcome quickly (hah ha, the scrawny nerd looks like Dwayne Johnson now, and the awkward girl has washboard abs!), but the actors take their assignments to play teenagers so seriously that the film surfs along on a wave of poker-faced earnestness, mixing moments of pathos in with its super-broad slapstick. (Except for Dan Castellaneta\u2019s Homer Simpson, nobody screams in pain more hilariously than Kevin Hart.) At certain points you might feel as though you\u2019re watching the longest, most lavishly produced \u201cSaturday\u00a0Night Live\u201d sketch ever, complete with lush jungle scenery (the film was shot partly on location in Hawaii) and attacks by CGI hippos, rhinos, monkeys, crocodiles and the like.\u00a0But since the entire thing plays like a 10-year old\u2019s Disney Channel fantasy of what adolescence will be like, it works well enough, especially when coupled with intense discussions of the game\u2019s rules (how many lives you get, how many levels there are, how to lift the curse from the land, etc).\u00a0 Advertisement Both the videogame\u2019s construction and its gender politics are very \u201890s. The movie is aware of this and makes fun of it, though there\u2019s a bit of an eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too aspect to the way it puts Johnson and Gillan's bodies on display. There are occasional jolts of mayhem, thanks mainly to the motorcycle-riding ninjas who do the bidding of the movie\u2019s villain John Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), a demonic figure who wants to control the Jaguar\u2019s Eye and claim dominion over the land. The action scenes are constructed with a bit of panache and manage to be exciting though you\u2019re never seriously worried that any major character is going to lose all of their lives. Kasdan, a veteran filmmaker who happens to be the son of \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d and \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, has an old-school sense of how to build those kinds of sequences. The shots are thoughtfully composed, for the most part, and you always know where you are and what's at stake from moment to moment. The script\u2019s scenarios allow for charming, often faintly surreal funny character moments, as when Black\u2019s round yet flouncy Bethany instructs Gillan\u2019s super-fit but still physically awkward Martha on how to be sexy. Black\u2019s \"hey, sailor\" walk evokes Bugs Bunny in drag, and Gillan\u2019s subsequent \u201cseductive\u201d dance to distract some guards looks as if she\u2019s trying to shake sand out of her shorts while simultaneously dealing with a bad case of swimmer\u2019s ear. The film doesn\u2019t have the nerve to follow some of its more subversive ideas (such as Bethany lusting after Alex) to their logical conclusions, probably because this is an expensive project that\u2019s terrified of alienating a certain sector of the public (imagine the walkouts if Jack Black lip-locked with Nick Jonas in something other than a CPR situation). But it\u2019s still more surprising in more ways than it had to be, and the performers are clearly having such fun playing insecure teenagers that you stay involved even when the thinness of the enterprise becomes undeniable. This is a two-and-a-half star movie, honestly, bumped up a notch because the actors are likable, the film doesn\u2019t have a cruel thought in its head, and the sentimental finale feels earned.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Dark Horse", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "I have a soft spot for sports movies where an underdog comes up from behind, culminating in a moment of pure triumph. The genre can be hokey or sentimental, but there is an underlying power and inspiration in those cliches. \"The Dark Horse\" is a great example. Based on the true story of Maori speed-chess master Genesis Potini, and directed by James Napier Robertson, it's a feel-good story \r\nwith the potential to make you feel great. What makes it unique is the Maori background, the atmosphere of poverty and violence in the community, a people marked by the genocide perpetrated upon them. In that environment, chess becomes not only a life-saver for kids who are born into inherited hopelessness, but also a metaphor for strategies on how to get through life. Strategy combats chaos, strategy focuses people on one goal, and with strategy, winning is actually possible. That's what \"The Dark Horse\" is all about.\u00a0 Advertisement Genesis Potini is the center of \"The Dark Horse,\" (his nickname in the chess world) and the film is as much a character study as anything else. Potini had a bipolar diagnosis (treated realistically in the film with not a whiff of condescension or grandstanding), and spent his life in and out of hospitals, with short jail stints for vagrancy. He was a phenom-prodigy at chess, winning competitions, and eventually helping form a chess club for underprivileged kids in his community called The Eastern Knights (the organization still exists today; Potini died in 2011). Potini's older brother taught him how to play chess when they were kids, presenting the different chess pieces as nearly-mythological figures with special powers. Chess was a way for them to access the pride of their culture and history, the fact that they all \"once were warriors.\" It is a militaristic game played by two people, but what happens on the board is a group event, and that was how Potini viewed the game. Genesis is portrayed by wonderful character actor, Cliff Curtis, so unforgettable in the Maori dramas \"Once Were Warriors\" and \"Whale Rider,\" as well as in small roles in \"Three Kings,\" \"Training Day\" and \"The Insider.\" (Currently, Curtis can be seen stealing AMC's \"Fear the Walking Dead.\") The actor has an imposing lumbering presence, reminiscent of Lee J. Cobb, and a malleable face. In \"The Dark Horse,\" he returns to New Zealand to take on one of the best roles in his career. As the toothless Genesis he is ruminative, gentle, often detached from surrounding events, but when he plays chess he is a ferocious competitor who can see six or seven moves ahead.\u00a0 \"The Dark Horse\" opens with a dream-like sequence in which Genesis, in the grip of manic hallucinations, staggers down the middle of a street in the rain, heading into a \"curios\" store as though by appointment. There's an old-fashioned chess set on display, and Genesis stands over it, dripping rainwater onto the board, playing a game against himself as the well-dressed, white customers stand back, watching. Genesis is taken off to jail for disturbing the peace, and then released into the custody of his older brother, Ariki (Wayne Hapi). Ariki is entrenched in Maori gang-culture, the house filled with scary-looking drunk tattooed guys who stare at Genesis with contempt.\u00a0 Advertisement Genesis seeks out an old chess buddy, who runs an after-school chess club for local kids and offers his services as a coach. It is when Genesis starts teaching the kids chess in an old ramshackle shed that the film takes off. The group of kids are not professional actors. They come from Genesis' world. They look like street kids; trash-talking, rambunctious, but also incredibly sweet and transparent to the camera. Genesis is an excellent and inspiring teacher, and decides, on impulse, that he wants to take the kids to the Auckland junior chess tournament. To say that it's a \"long shot\" that the kids will make any kind of a good showing in Auckland is an understatement.\u00a0 \"The Dark Horse\" takes time to portray Genesis' conflicts with his brother, his growing relationship with his nephew Mana (the young James Rolleston, in an extraordinary performance), and his devotion to passing on his love of chess to the kids, hoping that it will provide for them what it provided him: guidance, a sense of possibility, and maybe even a \"way out.\" This central theme is made most explicit in the case of Mana, who is in the process of going through a brutal gang-initiation, at his father's urging.\u00a0  The film is inspired by \"Dark Horse,\" Jim Marbrook's 2003 documentary about Potini.\u00a0 Robertson spent time with the real life Potini while adapting his story into a dramatic feature. He has a great respect for the bare bones of the story, and relishes the exuberance of the kids, their different personalities, their transformation into competitors. The chess tournaments are total nail-biters. Dana Lund's score pulses beneath much of the action, throbbing single notes that underline the urgency, rather than manipulating audience-response. Advertisement The way \"The Dark Horse\" unfolds may be the ultimate in sports-movie cliches. But that doesn't mean there is no suspense, that it's a \"done deal\" that the kids will be able to handle the pressure of entering a mostly white middle-class pursuit such as chess. (In this respect, the film is reminiscent of \"Stand and Deliver,\" another sports-genre movie, where Edward James Olmos plays an inner-city math teacher determined to teach calculus to a student population underestimated and ignored.) As Genesis gives his chess lectures, he has a couple of rules for his students. Their main job is to protect the King. Protecting the King takes on enormous significance considering their shared history. It's part of their epic story. Another rule he drums into them is that no piece on the board should be left behind. Circle the wagons around your community. Try to save everyone. And finally: Don't keep the focus on the rigid lines of figures on the board's edges, but launch yourself out into the center. The center is where the real battle goes down. Miguel Najdorf, the Argentianian grandmaster, said of Bobby Fischer, whose ruthlessness on the chess board was legendary: \u201cFischer wants to enter history alone.\u201d Genesis Potini, also ruthless when playing, viewed chess as a group endeavor (on the board and off). Entering history may not have been his goal, but if he were to enter history, his group must come with him.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "From the Land of the Moon", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "It may have been earlier for you\u2014I can be skeptical to a very definite fault\u2014but for me, 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Immigrant\u201d was the moment I finally accepted Marion Cotillard as an acting force of nature. Not that I had disliked the French performer prior to that. I always enjoyed seeing her turn up, even in otherwise ghastly films (remember her in Ridley Scott\u2019s mortifying attempt at light comedy, \u201cA Good Year\u201d?). But it was with \u201cThe Immigrant\u201d that I had that moment of transition from \u201cShe\u2019s very good\u201d to \u201cshe\u2019s incredible,\u201d and that impression held, of course, through 2014\u2019s \u201cTwo Days, One Night,\u201d her collaboration with the Belgian filmmaking brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne. For \u201cAnchorman 2,\u201d maybe not so much. But you get the idea.  Advertisement Cotillard is the anchor of \u201cFrom The Land of the Moon,\u201d directed by Nicole Garcia from a script that Garcia, Jacques Fieschi, and Natalie Carter adapted from a novel by Milena Agus. She plays Gabrielle, a woman of post-WWII rural France who\u2019s a fool for love. The picture begins by framing a flashback. Gabrielle and her husband Jose are driving to Lyon, taking their young son to participate in a piano competition. She sees a street sign, demands the car stop, and runs out. Her husband placidly drives on, which is odd. Gabrielle finds a house, and an apartment belonging to one Monsieur Sauvage, which sounds like a pretty potentially on-the-nose name. She contemplates ringing the bell \u2026 and the flashback begins. Gabrielle is in late schooldays, mooning over a teacher who gives her a copy of Wuthering Heights\u00a0and practically propositioning him days later. Willful Gabrielle seems, later, to be shaping her life according to the parameters limned by a Bronte sister, or perhaps by Flaubert. She is bedeviled by physical pain, and her mother tells a doctor she\u2019s not sure whether her daughter isn\u2019t faking them. Frustrated by Gabrielle\u2019s behavior, the mother offers to marry her off to a local Spanish laborer. Jose\u2019s pride is affronted, but not too terribly. The feisty Gabrielle immediately informs him that she\u2019ll never love him.  So, it\u2019s not an immediately blessed marriage, but Jose manages to keep his frustrations tamped down, at least for much of the time. This is because he\u2019s a decent sort, but also because Gabrielle\u2019s not faking her physical pain. Diagnosed with what we now call plain old kidney stones (the movie\u2019s French title, \u201cMal de pierres\u201d translates to \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d \u201cstones\u201d), she seeks a \u201ccure\u201d at a mountain spa that specializes in water treatments.  Away from domestic life, she luxuriates in the crisp air. Soon she spies Lieutenant Sauvage, played by Louis Garrel, a young French male star with what Bullwinkle Moose used to call \u201cthe ultry-sultry look.\u201d Pale and quiet, missing a leg from his stint in the war in Indochina, Garrel\u2019s character seems too delicate to live. And so Gabrielle and he are drawn into a very fraught affair. It is this Lieutenant whom the now more steadily domesticated Gabrielle seeks out years later. But not before a reluctant return home, the birth of a child (which she believes to be not Jose\u2019s), and a meaningful chat with her younger sister, who mentions she\u2019d like a divorce. \u201cWe don\u2019t divorce in this family,\u201d Gabrielle tells her sister. The sister responds, \u201cYou\u2019ve not been unhappy with Jose?\u201d Gabrielle allows that she has not. This seems rather improbable. \u201cFrom the Land of the Moon\u201d is a melodrama with an interesting trick in its tail, but I don\u2019t think that director Garcia pulls the trick off as well as she might have. The movie is sumptuously shot by Christophe Beaucarne; every frame is robustly picturesque. But the story could have used a little less \u201cUnder the Tuscan Sun\u201d and a little more \u201cAll That Heaven Allows.\u201d Not that I mean to be cryptic about it, but I don\u2019t want to give the whole thing away either. In any event, even if the execution lacks in other areas, Cotillard has a field day with the role of Gabrielle, committing to her needy passion without batting an eye, even when it\u2019s manifesting itself in the most mortifying ways. It\u2019s a protean performance.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Great Gilly Hopkins", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "If you\u2014or, more likely, someone you love, but I shouldn\u2019t presume in any event\u2014are in the market for an effective Young Adult tearjerker, \u201cThe Great Gilly Hopkins\u201d will get the job done. Directed by Stephen Herek from David Paterson\u2019s adaptation of Katherine Paterson\u2019s YA novel, \u201cThe Great Gilly Hopkins\u201d is a spectacularly foursquare \u201cfamily is what you make it\u201d redemption story. The kind of thing that film critics like to dismiss as \u201clooking like a made-for-TV movie,\u201d as if that comparison/analogy even holds as a dismissal anymore.  Advertisement Which is not to say that the movie as it stands has any real cinematic distinction. Director Herek brings his \u201cMr. Holland\u2019s Opus\u201d game here, but if you\u2019ve spent any time with the filmmaker\u2019s body of work, you already know that his \u201cBill & Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure\u201d game is not appreciably edgier. The man knows how to lay out whatever he\u2019s called upon to lay out. That is, coherently. For any emotional content he leaves things to his actors.  He\u2019s got a good bunch of them here. Canadian teen actor Sophie N\u00e9lisse plays the title role, a young girl in foster care who we know is not terribly well-off emotionally because her hair is so flat. Her attitude stinks, too. Dropped off by a child services worker at the house of beaming kindly Christian Maime Trotter (Kathy Bates in milk-of-human-kindness mode), Gilly behaves in such an immediately insufferable fashion that you\u2019re practically rooting for her to get kicked out on to the street. (Or for Bates to get some of her Annie Wilkes mojo back.) Gilly terrifies the emotionally damaged little boy who\u2019s also living in the ramshackle but warm-hearted house. She literally steals from the blind man living across the street, a kindly fellow played beautifully by Bill Cobbs. The movie, naturally, wants to have things both ways, so Gilly is also depicted as having terrific pluck\u2014she\u2019s pretty badass with the male bullies at her school, too.  And of course, behind all this is the revelation that she ain\u2019t no delinquent, she\u2019s misunderstood. All Gilly really wants is a real family life with her mom, who abandoned her as an infant and whose life she imagines as spectacularly glamorous. (That said mom is played by Julia Stiles, giving this critic the first strong \u201cMan, am I old\u201d shiver that he\u2019s had at a screening since, well, forever.) This excuse did not, for this viewer, contain as much water as it was intended to. For instance, Gilly finds herself doing better in school than she intended\u2014her strategy has been to get kicked out of every situation in which she\u2019s been placed, the better to free herself for Mom Pursuit\u2014and so decides to alienate her African-American schoolteacher (Octavia Spencer) by PRETENDING to be racist. The thing about pretend racism is that, in order to pull it off (imagining that you would want to, of course), you have to say and/or do actual racist things, which are ugly and hard to forgive. I suppose this plot point is indicative of a desire to make contemporary family/redemption tales more relevant/realistic/pertinent, but I found the whole episode just plain ugly, despite the teacher\u2019s humane reaction and Spencer\u2019s as-ever expert depiction of it.  Gilly is found out, in a sense, just as she\u2019s beginning to appreciate the good thing she\u2019s got in Trotter and the kid and the nice blind man and all. And then along comes the Third Act Glenn Close Surprise Plot Twist. A monkey wrench is once more thrown into Gilly\u2019s schemes, and a final confrontation with Pursued Mom ensues\u2014Stiles shows up so fleetingly that one is surprised she doesn\u2019t split by saying, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got another Bourne movie to get to.\u201d Still, the climax gets its redemptive job done. And Gilly gets a very becoming new hairstyle in the bargain.  Did I find myself getting a little choked up by the end? I did. It\u2019s a great cast that knows its business. If it can get someone who\u2019s so out of its core demographic a little verklempt, imagine what it can do for someone who\u2019s a target for such fare.

{"Title": "Sweet Country", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "It takes a while to fully register that this Australian Western is set in the late 1920s. There\u2019s a lot of space in the Northern Frontier in which it is set, and it\u2019s unsullied by telephone poles or power lines or railroad tracks. It\u2019s only late in the film, in a scene in which a particularly bothered character rides his horse in front of a projector that\u2019s screening a movie out of doors that a sense of the modern world comes across. At least in material terms. In terms of racial attitudes, most of the white characters in \u201cSweet Country\u201d are as contemporary, and/or as ancient and trite, as they come. The movie opens on a peaceful scene as Sam Neill\u2019s character, Fred Smith, sits on his porch. He\u2019s approached by Harry March, a young rancher just back from the Boer war. He wants Harry to give him some help with a fence; he offers him rum and tobacco as reward. \u201cWe don\u2019t drink here at Blackhill; we don\u2019t smoke either.\u201d March insists Smith lend him one of his farm hands, an indigenous Australian who goes by the name of Sam Kelly (Hamilton Morris). \u201cIt\u2019s the Christian thing to do,\u201d March simperingly says to Smith, who\u2019s revealed himself as a man of religious inclination.    Advertisement As he works with Sam Kelly, March evinces a morbid interest in the lifestyle of the indigenous man. \u201cYou marry \u2018em young around here, don\u2019t you?\u201d March says, referring to the younger woman in Harris\u2019 household. No, Harris says; that\u2019s his niece.    After closing all the shutters in a house on his ranch the better to rape Sam Harris\u2019 wife, March tells her: \u201cI wanted the other one, but you\u2019ll do.\u201d    You might say March has it coming, and he certainly does, but when he gets it, from Sam Harris, who is eventually driven to shoot March in self-defense, the sense of justice is short-lived. One understands that terrible things are likely to happen to Sam now. He goes on the run, another war veteran who\u2019s now the local law, a Sergeant Fletcher (Bryan Brown) is summoned, and a miniature posse, including Fred Smith, who\u2019s going along to make sure Sam is captured and brought back alive.    But these \u201cwhite fellas\u201d have not got a clue what they\u2019re in for as they trail Sam into his own country. The aborigines who haven\u2019t made peace, let alone maybe ever seen, white settlers, prove a swift and persistent danger, not just to Fletcher and company but to Sam and his wife. Then there are the elements, including a great salt desert (or so it appears to be) which is the setting for one of the movie\u2019s most hallucinatory scenes, a shudderingly gorgeous mixture of beauty and dread.    For all that, on return Fletcher tells the barmaid whom he wants to settle down with that he saw a lot of \u201csweet country\u201d on his quest. This is a movie of visuals first and foremost; it\u2019s no fluke that director Warwick Thornton shared cinematography duties with Dylan River. In addition to capturing stunning images, Thornton has a sleight-of-hand maestro\u2019s joy in shuffling and fanning them. Lightning-fast cuts to flashbacks and flash-forwards keep the viewer on his or her toes in a bracing fashion. The words of Steven McGregor and David Tranter\u2019s script stay out of the way, except when they don\u2019t, particularly at the movie\u2019s end, which yields an anguished line from one of the characters that\u2019s on the nose to the point of self-parody.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Zero Theorem", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Terry Gilliam, the onetime Monty Python animator turned influential filmmaker, is incapable of putting a dull image onscreen. \"The Zero Theorem,\" his first science fiction movie since 1996's \"Twelve Monkeys,\" is a visual dazzler on the level we'd expect from the director. As always, he fills the screen with intricately choreographed tableaus that have that ferociously jumbled quality: there are usually four or five things going on in each shot, and they're always related to the film's main themes. The cast, which includes Christoph Waltz, Melanie Theirry, Matt Damon and David Thewlis, is world-class. It's hard to imagine how any individual part of the physical production could be improved.\u00a0 Advertisement But the movie's allegory-steeped plot \u2014 in which Waltz's,\u00a0Qohen Leth, who \"crunches entities\" for a technology company called Mancom, tries to solve a theorem that'll reveal if life has meaning \u2014 is a case of \"close, but no cigar.\" And no matter how feverishly Gilliam directs and no matter how enthusiastically his actors act, the whole thing remains too, er, theoretical\u2014as if its main purpose is to demonstrate or disprove certain propositions rather than invest us in the hero's quest for happiness and enlightenment. Knowing Gilliam's humanism, this seems unlikely, but that's what comes through.\u00a0 Screenwriter Richard Pushin was reportedly inspired by the book of Ecclesiastes, but the plot seems equally influenced by \"Waiting for Godot,\" \"1984\" and the collected works of Franz Kafka (the latter two sources shaped Gilliam's \"Brazil\" as well). Even though it was written directly for the screen, \"Zero Theorem\" often feels like a stage play that was adapted without being fully remained as a movie. It's visually energetic but ultimately feels constrained and repetitious. The main locations are Mancom headquarters, a nightclub filled with writhing revelers, and the hero's apartment/laboratory, a cavernous space with a black-and-white chessboard-style floor and smoky shafts of light streaming through windows. The\u00a0cathedral-like quality of Quohen's place befits the spiritual pilgrim who occupies it. Quohen has been depressed and angry for a long time because he keeps hoping for a phone call that will assure him that life has meaning (shades of \"Godot\")\u00a0; when it finally arrives, he muffs it and spends the rest of the movie beating himself up.\u00a0 Quohen is reassigned to work at home by the company's psych evaluator, Dr Shrink-Rom (Tilda Swinton), an artificially intelligent computer program who simulates warmth and involvement.\u00a0(Swinton is hilariously intense here; between this role and her bucktoothed-Ayn-Rand routine in \"Snowpiercer,\" the Hugos should give her a Most Valuable Player award.) Quohen gets diagnosed with ailment after ailment and eventually dons a body suit that connects him directly to the Internet, making his physical being virtual. It's red and green, with a hoodie cap like a droopy Alpine horn that tapers into braided, vaguely intestinal cables. When Quohen wears the suit while sitting at his terminal typing, the image suggests a porn-addicted Christmas elf.\u00a0 Advertisement Other characters drift in and out of the story, alleviating or increasing the hero's irritability and spiritual malaise. The curvy blond\u00a0Bainsley (M\u00e9lanie Thierry) rescues Quohen at a party when he nearly chokes on an olive, and proves responsible for getting him reassigned to work at home, then keeps reappearing in his life, eventually providing him with his signature elf suit and then being revealed as a secret Internet striptease artist. Many of the characters evoke indelible players from Gilliam's \"Brazil\": there's a Walter Mitty or Winston Smith-type wise-yet-meek everyman (the hero), an obnoxious mediocrity of a supervisor (David Thewlis), and a blandly intimidating boss (Matt Damon), whose character is identified only as Management, and whose natty suits, owlish eyeglasses, grey hair and dulcet voice make him seem like Peter Bogdanovich's all-powerful kid brother. There are some twists and turns in the plot, all having to do with the true meaning and purpose of the Zero Theorem. At the end, the mysteries are laid out for us methodically, as if we're seeing the philosophical version of a drawing-room mystery where the murderer is the Frankensteinian post-capitalist society we've all gotten way too comfortable with, and the victim is the human soul.\u00a0 I wish, however, that the characters were allowed to be as well as to represent, if that makes sense. Gilliam's other films, even the bad ones, all managed to balance the need to deliver aphorisms and lessons against the obligation to involve us in the characters' plights. Every character in this movie remains stubbornly and elusively abstract. We know what everybody stands for, but we never really know them. After a while you start to miss the aching humanity of Sam Lowry in \"Brazil\" or the lovers in \"Twelve Monkeys,\" or the exquisitely fragile energy of Robin Williams in Gilliam's \"The Fisher King.\"\u00a0 The movie's at its most engaging when it's just showing us the world that causes Quohen such distress. An early scene in which the hero leaves his abode and tries to walk along a city thoroughfare while a video ticker on the side of a building tracks him with tailored sales pitch is a marvelous comment on how technology turns every environment into a retail outlet, and every person into a target of opportunity. (It's like that moment in \"Minority Report\" where Tom Cruise walks through a mall while ads chirp at him.) There are some exquisitely blocked and executed long takes, and a virtual-fantastical interlude on a tropical beach that ranks with the best scenes Gilliam has directed. In its better moments, \"Zero Theorem\" does seem like the work of a brilliantly cranky cartoonist who's spent years obsessing over what the world has become, then finally sat down, opened a sketchbook and started drawing. The problem is, once you've watched \"Zero Theorem,\" you'd rather go look at the sketchbook. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "One of Us", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The title\u00a0\"One of Us\" cuts deeply, in two directions. This documentary by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady zeroes in on three individuals who were once part of a tightly knit community of Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn, New York. All three eventually left the tribe, as it were, because they found its conditions for membership suffocating, even abusive.\u00a0 All three are caught by the filmmakers in the process of transforming themselves into secular Americans living life in the mainstream, enjoying the freedom that comes from being about to make bold personal choices, but also feeling abandoned and hated by the family and friends who remained on the other side. They're becoming part of a larger world now\u2014one of \"them\" as opposed to one of \"us,\"\u00a0or maybe the other way around.\u00a0 Advertisement Teenaged Ari endured a horrendous crime as a child that was covered up by his community; it eventually contributed to his cocaine addiction (he's survived two overdoses). Luzer is a twenty something man who realized one day that he couldn't stand to live under the constraints of the community, got a divorce, left his family New York and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming an actor. Etty, now 32, has the most disturbing story. She was pushed into marriage with an abusive man\u00a0at 19 and has had seven children. The\u00a0entire extended family plus a wider circle of friends have joined forces to stop her from\u00a0divorcing her husband and starting over.\u00a0 This is complex and often explosive subject matter, and in examining it, the excellent team of\u00a0Ewing and Grady (\u201cThe Boys of Baraka,\u201d \u201cJesus Camp\u201d and \u201cDetropia\")\u00a0tread as carefully as they can, given the constraints they're under. Specifically, they can only tell one side of this story: the Hasidim, who rail against the secular world and are suspicious of cell phones and the Internet,\u00a0aren't about to sit for interviews with these filmmakers. That means that we're never going to hear their side of things.\u00a0 This is not to say that whatever we might might have heard\u00a0would have created\u00a0an \"one the one hand, on the other hand\" dynamic\u2014clearly, all three of the filmmakers' subjects had excellent reasons for leaving the community, and even if their reasons had been flighty or\u00a0specious, they should still have had\u00a0the right to determine their own destiny without fear of being ostracized or punished. That said, the most fascinating, albeit quite\u00a0brief, portion of the movie comes in the form of a history lesson: we find out\u00a0that the Hasidic Jewish community sprung up as a response to the Holocaust\u2014that they see themselves as holy replacements for the millions who were slaughtered in the 1930s and '40s. Everyone, including abusers, have reasons for doing what they do; a bit more on this subject might've made an already wrenching documentary even more powerful.\u00a0 Then again, \"One of Us\" is so strong as-is that its more harrowing sections\u2014particularly Ari's account of his childhood suffering and the details of Etty's fight for freedom\u2014are so already hard to watch that you might want to turn away. There's nothing more exhilarating or more terrifying than taking control of one's own life.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Cemetery of Splendour", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "It's difficult to say what Apichatpong Weerasethakul's \"Cemetery of Splendor\" is about, and in many respects, to discuss its meaning would be to diminish it. The film works the way a Shakespearean sonnet works in that it actually increases its impact the moment it's over. Within its structure lies multiple intersecting and contradicting arcs of meaning, none of which cancel each other out but instead create a vast pool of associations. To try to narrow it down into \"what it means\" would be ruinous, akin to ripping apart a butterfly's wings to see how they operate. You may gain some insight, but you have destroyed the whole. The word \"unique\" is sometimes over-used, but in Weerasethakul's case, it applies. His films are personal, and what interests him is evident, but the way he decides to \"put things together\" is \"sui generis.\" He is an artist who follows his own star with such devotion that his films feel like memories of a collective distant past, snatched from the surface of the subconscious, suggesting the iceberg below. His images have great and dreamy staying power.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Cemetery of Splendour\" takes place in a small rural hospital in Isan, Thailand. In the main ward, a group of ex-soldiers lie in cots, sleeping all day and all night. Volunteers minister to them. A series of gently curving tubes are placed beside each bed, tubes that glow and pulsate through different spectrums of colored light, green flowing into red and into blue. Nobody is quite sure what has brought on the marathon sleeping. Outside, a nearby field is being dug up, giant machines heaving up mountains of dirt. Children play amongst the mounds. It is said that the hospital is built on a cemetery of ancient kings, still engaged in fighting a war on another plane, sapping the current-day soldiers of their energy. Jen (Jenjira Pongpas, who has appeared in multiple Weerasethakul films) volunteers in the hospital. One of Jen's legs is shorter than the other, requiring her to walk with a cane and wear a special shoe. Her disability is treated matter-of-factly, not even referenced, until a devastating later moment when it is addressed directly in one of the most astonishing scenes in recent memory. Jen ministers to one of the soldiers whose name is Itt (Banlop Lomnoi). She feels a connection to him, she bathes his body with an almost erotic tenderness. Sometimes he wakes up, suddenly, and the two of them take walks, talk, and then, just as suddenly, he falls unconscious. Jen and Itt's relationship is the main story, I suppose, but that would be like saying \"Hamlet\" is \"about\" a boy and his mother. While the film unfolds, you are caught in its undulating rhythms, drawn from image to image, given the time to contemplate the juxtaposition, how the film is put together and why. It's so rich that way. Once the screen goes to black, you are left to your own devices in terms of interpretation. There are other recent films in this tradition, \"Upstream Color,\" \"Post Tenebras Lux,\" where meaning is contained IN the images: the films are like entering someone else's dream-logic. Things \"make sense\" in profound dreams, and the dreamer may feel he is being given a kind of truth unavailable to him in the waking world.\u00a0 Advertisement Weerasethakul films in long-shot quite a bit. He doesn't move the camera all that much. He doesn't cut from face to face in a conversation. He does not tell you where to look. And yet, as a filmmaker, he helps an audience to see with an inner eye, to get fancy about it. (There's a sequence in \"Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives\" when a princess swims in a moonlit pool that is unlike anything else I have ever seen, and it stays with me, almost as though it's a memory, a glimpse of something from long ago that I can't quite remember.)\u00a0 There are things in \"Cemetery of Splendour\" that remain unexplained, but they are fascinating. There's a shot of people sitting in a little park looking out at a river. Slowly, almost before you realize it is happening, each person stands up and moves to another bench, and then to another bench, or across, in a dance of musical chairs. It's presented as though this happens sometimes in life, reminiscent of Jacques Tati's group scenes in \"Playtime,\" where the mundane transforms unexpectedly into a huge pantomime.\u00a0 Jen goes to pray for Itt at a nearby shrine, where two mannequins representing princess deities stand behind the altar. Later, while having lunch by herself, two young women come over and sit down with her. They introduce themselves: They're the princesses from that shrine and they heard her prayer, they giggle. In a world where soldiers sleep in uninterrupted paralysis, perhaps because of the influence of ancient kings, anything is possible. In a walk through the woods, there seem to be fragments of Ozymandias-like statues lying in the leaves, relics of past glory from battles long forgotten. I thought of Harriet Beecher Stowe's poem \"The Other World,\" and its vision of the porous border between the living and the dead:\u00a0 Advertisement It lies around us like a cloud,\u00a0The world we do not see;\u00a0Yet the sweet closing of an eye\u00a0May bring us there to be.\u00a0 In one extraordinary sequence, Weerasethakul shows us a series of images: a lit-up billboard on a roadside, a quiet riverbed, the sleeping soldiers, shopping-mall escalators descending, filled with people. He lingers on each one for awhile before he starts to change it, and the changes come imperceptibly at first. The screen slowly starts to flood with different colors of light, green, red, blue, yellow. The crowds of people on the escalator don't seem to notice that suddenly the light is bright yellow and then melting into a dreamy blue. Life goes on as the whole atmosphere changes color. You could interpret this as: the colored tubes in the hospital ward affect people in the waking world. We all live near mystery and mortality but everyday life keeps that fact hidden from us. The interpretation, however, diminishes the power of the sequence. It exists beyond words.\u00a0 This is the potential of cinema, to show us experiences that lie beyond words. There is value in conventional narrative, and value in a good story told well. But being prescriptive about what cinema is, or what a good story needs in order to be effective, contracts the possibilities of the medium. Who made up those rules anyway? Weerasethakul embodies possibility.\u00a0 Weerasethakul's other films (most notably \"Uncle Boonmee\" and \"Syndromes and a Century\") share some similarities with \"Cemetery.\" The fantastical and surreal are presented with unshowy practicality. It's magical realism mixed with kitchen-sink drama, seasoned by a haunting sense of history as a sentient entity. A \"ghost\" isn't necessarily a spooky creature moving through walls. A ghost could also calmly sit down at the table and join the conversation. When death is near, the past comes flooding into the present, and sometimes the past bears a message, but how to de-code it? Perhaps it doesn't matter. Perhaps what matters is that we are connected to those who came before, that we honor them, and that we try to hear them.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Break Point", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"Your game is conservative.\" \"And your game is reckless.\" This end-stop exchange happens in \"Break Point\" when two estranged tennis-playing brothers (Jeremy Sisto and David Walton) decide to pair up again as a doubles-team and take a stab at qualifying for the U.S. Open. It's tennis-playing-style as (obvious) metaphor for human relationships. Directed by Jay Karas, and with a script by Sisto and Gene Hong, \"Break Point\" is a family-tennis drama with a plot that could be described as \"conflict-lite.\" All problems are telegraphed from the get-go, giving the film's opening scenes that weird vibe where characters spout exposition at one another. Films often descend into soap opera when the heat is turned up underneath conflict, but \"Break Point\" (effective performances notwithstanding) could have used a bit more of that heat, as well as a deeper interest in what tennis means to those who play it. Advertisement Jimmy (Sisto) is a 35-year-old tennis player who can't find anyone to partner with him anymore because he's undisciplined, aggressive, and a self-destructive party animal. He was once a teenage champion and then went pro, but his career didn't work out as planned. Darren (David Walton), Jimmy's brother and one-time doubles partner, has been a substitute teacher for seven years, and lets off steam hitting around a tennis ball by himself. His only friend appears to be Barry (Joshua Rush), a little kid with a sad home life and questionable outfits. Barry starts out as one of those annoying children who only exist in movies: precocious creatures who draw a sad-clown adult out of his shell by dispensing wise advice. Jimmy and Darren's dad is played by J.K. Simmons, the kind of actor who can fill a simple line like \"It's great to see you two together again\" with the entire emotional theme of the film. Jimmy, who has alienated everyone else in tennis, approaches his brother to partner with him for the pre-qualifying tournaments for the Open. Darren is wary but succumbs, not before making Jimmy promise to get his act together, stop drinking, and shape up. Jimmy moans and whines, throws massive John McEnroe-ish tantrums on the court. And of course there is a training montage, because what is a sports movie without a training montage? (I have a soft spot for training montages, so my comment is meant sincerely.) Once the men commit, they are single-minded about it to the\u00a0point\u00a0of obsession. They want to kick ass and win. As Martina Navratilova is supposed to have said, \"Whoever said, \u2018It\u2019s not whether you win or lose that counts,\u2019 probably lost.\" The tennis sequences are where director Karas needed to step up his own game. Both Sisto and Walton are believable as tennis players (probably not to a pro, but good enough). Their serves appear powerful, their forehands/backhands look confident. But the tennis scenes (and there are a lot of them) don't create the necessary illusion that we are seeing actual tennis being played; there's no visual sense of tennis' exhilarating parabolae and power. One of the real strengths of \"Miracle,\" the story of the 1980 Olympic hockey team, was director Gavin O'Connor's decision to cast college hockey players in the main roles, and then coach them in the rudiments of acting. The young inexperienced actors rose to the occasion all while playing pretty believable hockey. There's an Uncanny-Valley thing that happens sometimes when actors play professional athletes. You feel the artifice of it: it doesn't \"look right.\" The best tennis moment in \"Break Point\" comes early on when Sisto and Walton stand opposite one another, close to the net, and bat the ball back and forth with no bounces in between. It's shot with no cuts. It feels real because it is real. Advertisement While the various plot-lines (Jimmy's struggle to get his act together, Darren wanting to have a more interesting life, Barry wanting to be useful) are re-treads of pretty much any movie made in this vein, the actors bring some spontaneity and weirdness to their characters. Sisto has a wild and cynical essence as an actor and a way of squinting his eyes suspiciously at people as he tries to perceive their inner motivations. As Jimmy, he's a wreck, burping, yelling, flailing around, tantrum-ing out, all as Walton stands his ground in a pissed-off and yet thoughtful way. In \"The String Theory,\" David Foster Wallace's 1996 essay about Michael Joyce, a rising tennis star competing in the \"Qualies\" for the Canadian Open, Wallace (who had played tennis competitively as a kid) observes after watching some of the players, even low-ranked ones, \"I could not meaningfully exist on the same court with these obscure, hungry players. Nor could you. And it's not just a matter of talent or practice. There's something else.\" It's that \"something else\" that obsessed David Foster Wallace, the intersecting variables of athleticism, focus, endurance, and drive. \"Break Point\" is predictable and yet sometimes very funny. It's a mild-mannered film, strange considering the ferocious nature of tennis itself, the sport that supposedly holds \"Break Point\" together. The film takes almost no risks with its material, although there are some pleasurable spots along the way. There's something missing, though, that \"something else\" that David Foster Wallace talked about.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Only Yesterday", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "2014\u2019s U.S. release of Isao Takahata\u2019s amazing animated swan song \u201cThe Tale of the Princess Kaguya\u201d was a gift and a miracle in and of itself, but it\u2019s also yielding some dividends. The first great movie of 2016, as far as U.S. releases go, is an animated picture that was made in 1991: Takahata\u2019s breathtakingly beautiful and quietly but devastatingly moving \u201cOnly Yesterday,\u201d seeing its first screenings here in both its original Japanese-language version and a scrupulously English-dubbed edition featuring the voice talents of Daisy Ridley, Dev Patel, and Ashley Eckstein.\u00a0 Advertisement \u201cOnly Yesterday\u201d is one of a very distinguished handful of feature films that Takahata directed for Studio Ghibli, the outfit founded by Takahata\u2019s friend and frequent collaborator Hayao Miyazaki. Takahata\u2019s work has been marked by a determination to take on stories that U.S. viewers wouldn\u2019t necessarily associate with animation, for instance his 1988 World War II survival drama \u201cGrave of the Fireflies.\u201d He\u2019s also shown interest in expanding and changing up the aesthetic of anime, as in his 1999 \u201cMy Neighbors the Yamadas,\u201d designed in the seemingly minimalist style of Japanese comic strips. \u201cKaguya,\u201d which Takahata announced would be the last film he would direct, was a kind of grand summation of his work in terms of both form and content. \u201cOnly Yesterday\u201d is a good companion piece for a number of reasons\u2014like \u201cKaguya,\u201d it functions as a highly sensitive and empathetic consideration of the situation of women in Japanese society\u2014but it\u2019s also a breathtaking work of art on its own.\u00a0 There\u2019s no fantasy or supernatural element in the movie, but that\u2019s not to say that it entirely eschews the fantastic. The main character is a kind of young Japanese everywoman, or everywoman nonconformist. Taeko is a 27-year-old single salarywoman in 1982 Tokyo. The movie begins with her telling a work colleague that she\u2019s off to visit relatives in the countryside. Truth is, she has no actual close relatives there, but rather has signed up to help the family of her brother-in-law\u2019s older brother in her destination to harvest safflowers.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to bring my fifth-grade self along for the trip,\u201d Ridley, speaking with a U.S. accent (for those keeping track, Ridley is British and speaks with her native accent in this independent film called \u201cThe Force Awakens;\u201d her costar in that film, John Boyega, also hails from England but speaks in that film with an American accent; it\u2019s called acting, in case this all worries you), muses on the soundtrack of the English-dubbed version. And yet here she is. On the train, Taeko relates and relives events from her childhood. Some funny and charming, but most of them sad and disturbing. The mockery of more popular girls, the awkwardness of waiting for first menstruation, the cruel coldness of a father who refuses to allow her to participate in a semi-pro theatrical endeavor. The persistent squashing of her hopes and dreams helps make her eventual adult solitude make some kind of sense, but the film is not so crude as to make an overt insistence on cause-and-effect. The movie allows Taeko to keep some secrets, in a sense. As I mentioned, there are no overt fantasy elements in the story but the animated format allows visual metaphors for feelings to come to life. On the rare occasion when fifth-grade Taeko feels like she\u2019s floating on air, she floats, and a big pink heart appears in the sky. In the flashback sequences, Takahata\u2019s spectacular use of negative space\u2014the details of a softball field stretching out into a big field of white in the frame, for instance\u2014gives a palpable sense of a world only partially regained to the senses. Advertisement Once Taeko reaches her destination, she strikes up a friendship with young farmhand Toshio, with whom she talks out more of her mid-\u201860s trauma. The possibility of a romance is broached, but the film\u2019s ending, while tear-jerkingly satisfying, is \u2026 well, you ought to see it yourself. That it plays under the final credits is noteworthy.\u00a0 The English language version keeps the movie intact (I actually saw it for the first time in an unsubtitled Japanese version, via a laser disc I bought in Japan in the early \u201890s, such was my Studio Ghibli fandom at the time), Beatles references and cigarette-smoking characters and all.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "24 Hours to Live", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "One of the most joyous elements of the success of \u201cJohn Wick\u201d was the way in which that film used Keanu Reeves\u2019 particular on-screen presence to greatest impact. Action films often play to the strengths of their leading men from the everyman persona Bruce Willis carried into \u201cDie Hard\u201d to the world-weariness of Liam Neeson in \u201cTaken,\u201d and so it was with Mr. Wick, a role that felt tailormade for Reeves. However, the opposite reaction is produced while watching \u201c24 Hours to Live,\u201d a film that seems at odds with the grounded personality of its leading man, the wonderful Ethan Hawke. Throughout the film, you can see Hawke trying to bring resonance and truth to a movie that is plotted like a \u201cCrank\u201d sequel and has dialogue that sounds like it was written by a teenage boy. Watching the actor fight against the deep flaws of the film he\u2019s in is almost more interesting than the plot itself. At least it\u2019s more entertaining. Advertisement Hawke plays Travis Conrad, a man introduced fishing with his father-in-law (Rutger Hauer), talking about his soul. Moments later, they\u2019re pouring out the ashes of Travis\u2019 wife and son, who died a year ago that day. The manipulative device of Conrad\u2019s grief over losing his family will return again and again, and never be anything more than a cheap screenwriting trick. And it\u2019s not even a well-done one. Torn from any sort of family loyalty, Conrad should be a loose cannon, but Hawke and director Brian Smrz never quite get there, making him more grief-stricken than out-for-vengeance, even when he finds out he\u2019s got, wait for it, \u201c24 Hours to Live.\u201d    You see, this is no ordinary assassin film. After Conrad is called in for one last assignment, for which he\u2019ll be paid $2 million, he ends up getting plugged a couple times in the street. He wakes up on an operating table with a gasp, told that the government has invented a new technology that can basically resurrect anyone with a catch: they\u2019ve got 24 hours. And to add a bit of cinematic flair to that countdown, they literally put a ticking clock in the patient\u2019s arm. So, the nefarious Powers That Be wake Conrad to get a piece of vital information from him that he learned just before getting shot. Of course, they don\u2019t consider that one of their best assets may not just want to wait out the next 23:55 in the operating room, and Conrad breaks out, turns the tables, and comes after the people who brought him back to life.    A little bit of \u201cCrank\u201d and a little bit of \u201cJohn Wick\u201d with Ethan Hawke? Sounds like a great idea. How could a movie with an assassin with a death timer in his arm be so dull? The main problem is the aforementioned disconnect between actor and project. Hawke brings gravity to his roles, and this movie needed insanity. He\u2019s such a relatable, humane actor, but this kind of part requires something hollower\u2014a cog in the B-movie machine. Whenever Hawke tries to sell it believably, we can see the plot holes and manipulative tricks. Believe it or not, most of this doesn\u2019t make sense (particularly the fact that they wake Conrad to get information on a location that likely would have been moved after a street shoot-out, but whatever). I wish I could say that \u201c24 Hours to Live\u201d works best if you just shut off your brain and stop asking questions, but the point is that it\u2019s never fun enough for that to work. Suspension of disbelief in B-movie action requires a degree of joyous, rollercoaster, unhinged filmmaking. \u201c24 Hours to Live\u201d is too boring to not ask questions.    Here\u2019s where we could pick apart further failed elements of \u201c24 Hours to Live\u201d including the uniformly horrible supporting cast and lackluster direction, but why bother? Ethan Hawke, who makes roughly six films a year, will shake this off and move on, probably finding his \"John Wick\" somewhere down the road. You should wait until he does.

{"Title": "Maleficent", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The \"Sleeping Beauty\" riff \"Maleficent\" is another overproduced summer spectacular, released into a world that has too many. It has sub-\"Phantom Menace\" landscapes and creatures, a bombastic and unmemorable score, and the sorts of chaotic images and fast cutting that signify a lack of true filmmaking imagination. It is truly a movie made by a committee: its direction is credited to Robert Stromberg, a longtime production designer, and its script to \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d scribe Linda Woolverton, but there have been reports of many studio-imposed rewrites, and reshoots by director John Hancock (\"The Rookie\").\u00a0But it's powerful anyway. As the title character, a misunderstood and wronged woman, Angelina Jolie has make-up enhanced cheekbones that could be registered as lethal weapons. Put them together with her wary cobalt eyes and ruby lips and the wings and horns that the character sports early in the picture, and you've got an image of female otherness as eerie as Scarlett Johansson wading into black goo in \"Under the Skin.\"\u00a0 Advertisement The film's story is an example of what The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw calls \"that emerging post-'Wicked' genre, the revisionist-backstory fairytale,\" but it's affecting. It has a\u00a0primordial edge that the clumsy filmmaking can't blunt. There are moments in \"Maleficent\" that are profoundly disturbing, in the way that ancients myths and Grimm fairy tales are disturbing. They strike to the heart of human experience and create the kinds of memories that young children\u2014young girls particularly\u2014will obsess over, because on some level they'll know, even without the benefit of adult experience, that the film is telling them a horrible sort of truth. And at this point I should give you the opportunity to step away from the review, see the film based on the above description, and read the rest later to see if you agree. Fair enough? Good. The tale begins with a flashback to Maleficent as a young girl fairy, befriending a farm boy who's snuck into her forest on a mission of thievery. They grow close and continue to see each other, even after the king of a human stronghold on the outskirts of the forest tries to invade Maleficent's domain and then watches in shock as the heroine and her tree-warrior pals lay waste to his army. As teenagers, the fairy and the human share a silhouetted lip-lock on a hilltop\u2014\"true love's first kiss,\" in the Disney parlance. He stops coming around, breaking the girl's heart. Years later, the now adult Stefan (Sharlto Copley) overhears the now-dying king promising his realm to anyone who can kill Maleficent. And it's here that we head into the first of the film's magnificently disturbing sequences. I've read reviews complaining that we don't know enough about Maleficent and Stefan's personalities, much less the details of their relationship, which means that Stefan's betrayal \"comes out of nowhere,\" and so does not make dramatic sense. This is a fair description (or complaint); but to me, the lack of development makes the twist feel more like something that might happen in a fairy tale\u2014not a clean-scrubbed Disney fairy tale in which every plot twist is clearly delineated, but an ancient story that kids might listen to, rapt and horrified, then interrupt to ask, \"By why would the boy do that to someone he loved?\", whereupon the adult storyteller would explain that sometimes people do cruel things to people they love because they want things.\u00a0 Advertisement In any event, we know what's really going on in the scene. After snuggling with Maleficent on a hilltop, Stefan gives her a drink laced with a sleeping potion, prepares to murder her after she's passed out, then has a failure of nerve. He slices off her wings instead, and brings them to the king as \"proof\" that he did as promised. It's a symbolic assault with sexual overtones, specifically an attack that occurs after a woman has passed out. Maleficent doesn't just lose her wings; they're stripped from her, against her will. The attack is also a maiming or disfigurement that, in this context, feels like a gender specific physical \"message,\" drawn from a continuum that includes everything from the punitive hacking off of a woman's long hair to clitoridectomy. (Jolie underwent a double mastectomy not long before the film was shot; it's hard to imagine her shooting this sequence and not putting it in a personal context.)\u00a0 The scene of Maleficent waking up on a hilltop with huge scars in her back, then weeping with rage, is the most traumatizing image I've seen in a Hollywood fairy tale since the Christ-like sacrifice of Aslan in 2005's \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\" It strikes so deep, and its impact resonates for so long after, that it makes the film's numerous missteps seem less like deal breakers than irritants.\u00a0The assault transforms Maleficent from an unabashed heroine into an anti-heroine\u2014a straight-up bad guy, as far as the story's terrified humans are concerned\u2014and warps Disney's vanilla 1959 film into a conflicted revenge story with an unmistakable feminist undertone. It's the deepest betrayal imaginable. Every subsequent action Maleficent takes\u2014including casting a spell on Stefan's daughter Aurora (played as a teen by Elle Fanning) that will send her into a coma at age 16 after a finger-prick by a spinning wheel needle\u2014is driven by the trauma of that betrayal.\u00a0 The film has a long way to go after that\u2014plot-wise, I mean; at a sleek 98 minutes, this is a rare summer blockbuster that's as terse as the typical cartoon feature\u2014and while \"Maleficent\" never rises to the peak of power that it attains when the heroine awakes without her wings, and its action sequences and ostentatious creature displays are murky CGI soup, it keeps the audience unbalanced in a good way.\u00a0There's wasted motion in the plotting and a fair amount of confusion in how the script spells out what Maleficent can and can't do (if she can turn a raven into a male sidekick played by Sam Riley with a wave of her hand, and create a fire-breathing dragon with similar ease later on, why doesn't she just unleash an army of monsters on the kingdom and save herself a lot of bother?).\u00a0But we always know what's at stake for her.\u00a0We know where her head is at. \u00a0 Advertisement Despite winning a slew of deserved awards for early performances, Jolie has never gotten the credit she deserves as both an old-fashioned glamorous movie star and a skilled, thoughtful actress; this part fuses both sides of her talent. Her mesmerizing stillness makes us pay closer attention to Maleficent's every word and gesture than the film's screenplay deserves.\u00a0We feel close to Maleficent even when she's doing the ice-mask-of-death expression showcased in trailers and in stills. We feel her conflicted feelings as she pretends to be the young Aurora's godmother, playing a role and then slowly becoming that role, just as we felt her rage at being violated and mutilated, and her need to make the human kingdom (whose representatives are all male) pay for what was done in its name.\u00a0\u00a0 I was looking forward to seeing Angelina Jolie play a Disney villain. That's not \"Maleficent,\" obviously, but what she's asked to do is still fascinating. The character starts out good, turns bad for good reason, then tries to right the wrongs she committed in the name of righting wrongs. This is a film of Hollywood storytelling cliches, including the eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too villain death that lets the heroine seem noble while still satisfying the audience's bloodlust. But it's also a film of resonant gestures and dream logic, in which ancient and contemporary predicaments jostle against each other: romantic betrayal or sexual assault, and their psychological aftermath; the fundamental differences between male and female minds; the way that patriarchal culture fuses women's sense of self-worth to their bodies; even the tangled maternal impulses that independent single women who never wanted kids might experience when they have to care for a child. The movie is a mess, but it's a rich mess. It has weight. It matters.\u00a0Years from now you'll hear teenagers or college students bonding over having seen it as child and lost sleep over it, and its title will have acquired three more words, plus punctuation: \"Oh My God, Maleficent!\"", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Dreamcatcher", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Brenda Myers-Powell, an ex-prostitute who has devoted her life to helping at-risk women and girls through her organization The Dreamcatcher Foundation, is the compelling subject of veteran filmmaker Kim Longinotto's new documentary, \"Dreamcatcher,\" debuting on Showtime tonight, March 27, 2015. \"Dreamcatcher\" is an intimate portrait of one woman up against the systemic problem of human trafficking, child abuse, and violence, and her commitment to try to make a difference, one individual at a time. Despite the harrowing stories that fill the film from start to finish, \"Dreamcatcher\" is not hopeless. How could it be hopeless when there are people like Myers-Powell in the world? She is a living example, and she takes that responsibility seriously. As she says at one point, \"If you know somebody got your back, you'll make it.\" \u00a0 Advertisement Even just one \"witness\" (a guidance counselor, a teacher, a grandparent) can make a huge difference to an at-risk person in a violent situation. To many of the people Myers-Powell works with, she is that witness. The first witness and the only witness. Because she herself is a survivor (of a terrifying and violent childhood, followed by years on the streets as a prostitute), she carries with her an authority that resonates deeply with the people still in the midst of their chaos. You can almost see the realization dawning on the faces of these women and girls: Wait, if she got out, then could that be possible for me, too? That process, encouraged by Myers-Powell's non-judgmental space of listening and support, is what Longinotto captures so effortlessly in \"Dreamcatcher.\" Longinotto travels alongside Myers-Powell as she makes her various rounds: through the rough neighborhoods of Chicago where the prostitutes work the streets (\"Y'all need any condoms?\" Myers-Powell calls out the window at them), to juvenile detention centers, to prison, to high schools where she runs weekly after-school workshops.\u00a0 One can understand why Longinotto would be attracted to Myers-Powell as a subject. Myers-Powell is a dynamo of empathy and action. She is funny, smart, compassionate, and powerful. She has a different wig for every occasion. She is shown fielding phone calls from battered women, teenage runaways, prostitutes looking to get out of the life, all as she applies her feathery false eyelashes in the bathroom mirror. She drives around at night talking to prostitutes, offering them help, should they ever be ready to accept it. Many of them take her up on it. Her work is mostly unpaid. She runs workshops for people in prison for prostitution. She talks on their level, saying to a group of female convicts, \"Rule #8 in the pimp's code is Never let a Ho like another Ho.\" Women bonding and helping one another is a threat to the status quo, and Myers-Powell knows that breaking that code of silence is the linchpin of much of what she does. The multiple shots of women listening to one another, nodding in understanding, reaching out to touch someone else in support, shows the powerful space that Myers-Powell helps create.\u00a0 Survival to these women means a grim white-knuckling endurance test. Myers-Powell shows that survival can also be a triumph. However, she is not a superhero of inspiration, and in one of the most touching scenes in the film, she breaks down, worrying about the women relying on her, worrying what they will do when she takes a couple of weeks off to get knee surgery. In that scene, you sense the fragility of what she has created, the one-woman-show aspect of it, as she picks up the slack from exhausted social services and overworked child protection agencies. Myers-Powell helps people who don't even have a concept that help is possible. Myers-Powell listens to them, never betraying shock or disappointment or even surprise at the terrible events they relate, and it is through her listening that new possibilities open up. You can change people's lives by how you listen to them, and that transformation occurs in the various people we meet over the course of the documentary: Marie, an exhausted pregnant prostitute who has lived on the streets since she was 8 years old; Sharita, a teenage girl living with her older boyfriend to escape the chaos and violence at home; Temeka, a teenager working as a prostitute because her mother beats her and she can't take it anymore.\u00a0 Advertisement The world portrayed in \"Dreamcatcher\" is brutal and relentless, a gigantic turning wheel of violence transmitted down through generations. It is a world where the rules are set and unquestioned, a world that protects its predators, and punishes its victims. To be a documentary filmmaker of Longinotto's caliber (her former films include \"Divorce Iranian Style,\" \"Salma,\" \"Rough Aunties\") you must be a world-class trust-builder. Only when people trust you and the good intentions of your film, will they give you access to their experience. Longinotto's camera is allowed to witness some of the most intimate secrets of these women's lives, and that fact alone is a great testament to the filmmaker and her process.\u00a0 [Disclaimer: \"Dreamcatcher\" was finished in part due to a grant from The Ebert Foundation.]", "Critic": "Alpha"}

I start to try to figure out if and when they knew it was a\r\ndisaster. Was it during the extended \u201ckidney theft urban legend\u201d bit? Was it when\r\nthe director asked him to play a scene in which his tights get ripped off by a\r\nMexican woman calling herself Sarah McLachlan? Was it during the scene in which\r\na child falsely accuses them of molestation? When did these very funny and\r\nundeniably talented TV actors know that \u201cSearch Party\u201d was a disaster? Delayed\r\nalmost two full years since its original release date and now barely released after being out on DVD in Europe for over a year,\r\none gets the feeling that \u201cSearch Party\u201d wouldn\u2019t even be getting its minor\r\nrelease if stars T.J.

Advertisement One can almost see the thinking process that led to \u201cSearch\r\nParty.\u201d Get a bunch of talented TV actors together, hire a director who has\r\nwritten buddy comedies (Scot Armstrong, who has a co-writing credit on \u201cThe Hangover, Part II\u201d and a story credit on \u201cOld School\u201d),\r\nand why not pick up Tim Orr, the cinematographer from \u201cPineapple Express\u201d for good\r\nmeasure? It will write itself! No, it won\u2019t. Nardo (Thomas Middleditch) is going to marry Tracy (Shannon\r\nWoodward of \u201cRaising Hope\u201d) but has a stoned conversation that leads buddy\r\nJason (T.J. Miller) to believe that he should put a stop to the wedding despite the\r\nmore reasonable Evan\u2019s (Adam Pally) protestations. (In \u201cHangover\u201d casting terms,\r\nMiddleditch ends up being the wacky Zach Galifianakis, Pally is undeniably the Ed Helms,\r\nand Miller is the reckless Bradley Cooper). When Jason breaks the wedding up, Tracy\r\ngoes on the honeymoon anyway, leading Nardo to try to follow her to Mexico. Before\r\nyou know it, Nardo is calling Jason & Evan because he\u2019s been carjacked,\r\nleft naked in a small Mexican border town. Ignoring the advice of his co-worker\r\nElizabeth (Alison Brie) and boss MacDonaldson (Lance Reddick), Evan gets\r\nessentially hijacked by Jason to help out the third spoke in their friendship\r\nwheel. Along the way, they run into Krysten Ritter (\u201cMarvel\u2019s Jessica Jones\u201d),\r\nJason Mantzoukas (\u201cThe League\u201d), Jon Glaser (\u201cParks and Recreation\u201d) and J.B.\r\nSmoove (\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d). I\u2019ve seen awards shows with less TV stars in\r\nthe room. And yet none of them are given anything interesting to do. Armstrong and co-writers Mike Gagerman & Andrew Waller keep\r\nthrowing their protagonists into increasingly bizarre situations in the hope\r\nsomething will register as funny. When the film gets to an EXTENDED bit that\r\nriffs on the kidney-stealing urban legend at the end of the first act, you can\r\njust watch all potential for it to become something interesting dissipate. (This\r\nis the point that most people will change the channel on cable.) It\u2019s the kind\r\nof script that features a grown man lying on the floor in a moment of\r\ndepression and saying \u201cI\u2019m a dirty cum rag,\u201d and can\u2019t go to Mexico without\r\nusing \u201cLa Bamba,\u201d \u201cLa Cucaracha\u201d and a man covered in cocaine\u2014in the same scene. It eventually devolves into one of\r\nthose weird, \u201cHuh?\u201d movies in that I never thought I\u2019d see J.B. Smoove lick\r\ncocaine off Thomas Middleditch\u2019s face or Jason Mantzoukas shoot an arrow into\r\nAdam Pally\u2019s ass. But there are a lot of things here I never thought I\u2019d see that\r\njust aren\u2019t funny. \u201cSearch Party\u201d is one of those stunning failures in relation to its cast's talent. To their credit, Middleditch and Pally\r\nare asked to do a lot of physical comedy by their director\u2014the \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d\r\nstar spends most of the movie butt-naked (that still above either photoshopped in the shorts or it was an alternate take for airplane and network TV versions that will never happen)\u2014and they\u2019re always game for\r\neverything, further proving their willingness to do whatever takes to get a\r\nlaugh. Miller, Ritter, Mantzoukas, Smoove, Brie\u2014I love this cast, even if I\r\nmost certainly do not love this movie. In that sense, \u201cSearch Party\u201d pays off\r\non my morbid fascination, proving that even if you invite a lot of\r\ntalented people to the set, the result won\u2019t work if you don\u2019t give them a way\r\nto show why they\u2019re considered talented.

{"Title": "The Bag Man", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "There's darkness that is moody and effective. And then there is incompetent darkness where you can barely see what is going on. \"The Bag Man\", helmed by first-time director David Grovic, features darkness of the latter kind. Watching \"The Bag Man\", if nothing else, gives you a heightened appreciation of the lighting designers in the 1940s and 1950s, who were able to fill those noir screens with encroaching shadows, creating a palpable sense of impending doom, while never sacrificing clarity of image. \"The Bag Man\" is so sloppily executed it feels like they didn't have enough light fixtures to get the effects they wanted. But that's only one of the problems. The acting is fine. The story is pretty stock, but there's no shame in a stock story. The main issue is the script (co-wirtten by Grovik and Paul Conway), which is too clever for its own good, giving an impression of being very pleased with itself. Quentin Tarantino's scripts burst onto the scene in the early-1990s with a fresh voice and a fresh point of view, adding layers of irony and post-modern awareness to what were well-known cinematic tropes. Grovic tries to place his film in the same bucket but it suffers in comparison.  Advertisement John Cusack plays Jack, a hired gun, on the run from a shady past, involving an ex-wife who was murdered after they had an argument about his job. Robert De Niro plays a heavy named Dragna, who hires Jack to transport a mysterious black leather bag for him. Jack is warned over and over again to not look in the bag. The job is simple on the face of it: retrieve the bag, go to a specific motel, and wait in Room 13 for further instructions. Things go south almost immediately, of course, and the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the motel Jack is told to check into is, bar none, the creepiest motel in the history of America. Run by a wheelchair-bound paranoid guy played by Crispin Glover, who (shades of \"Psycho\") has a dead mother, the motel is populated by a motley crew of violent misfits, including a pimp with an eye patch, a cackling, evil Serbian-Roma dwarf in a tracksuit, and a leggy, blue-wigged hooker named Rivka (Rebecca Da Costa), who says she's from Israel even though she isn't: \"I like Israel. I love Israel.\"  Rivka latches herself onto Jack, hiding in his room from the pimp and the dwarf, who threaten to do horrible things to her when they retrieve her. Violence against Rivka is used as a motivating plot-point throughout, one of the script's more unsavory aspects. Later, when Jack and Rivka are hauled into a creepy police station for questioning and torture, Rivka lies mostly naked on a nearby table with one of the cops teasing at her panties with a threatening baton, and the Sheriff says to Jack, in an eyeroll of a line, \"If you send us on some kind of wild goose chase, we will take liberties with the girl.\" The script keeps circling back over the same territory, lacking urgency or a push forward. Lines are repeated in a way that gives an impression of a script spinning its wheels.  Robert De Niro's Dragna is a dude who wears plaid jackets, thick glasses, and his grey hair in a swoopy high pompadour. He is seemingly mild-mannered, and confesses that he wanted to go into \"academia\", but we know he is capable of violence; we see it early on. He courts Jack for the job by taking him for a flight in a gleaming private jet, carefully cutting his food up to demonstrate what he wants Jack to do: The broccoli is the money, the potato is the bag, etc. Dragna says things like, \"I am a connoisseur of the unexpected but I don't like surprises.\" De Niro plays these ridiculous lines well, undercutting the script and underplaying, which is really the only way to go. Dragna comes off as a truly loopy individual, urging Jack to read Hermann Hesse's \"Magister Ludi\" before taking the job, and asking him later if he has read the book. The book might help Jack understand the game. Because it's all a game, after all.  And maybe that's the problem. \"The Bag Man\" feels like a game. The stakes are seemingly high, but not really. Will Jack look in the bag? What do you think? Will Rivka turn out to be more than she says she is? What do you think? Even the big reveals, about the bag, and about Rivka, are handled in such a cliched manner that they lack the \"Keyser S\u00f6ze\" gasp of understanding they seem to require. We've seen it all coming. We've seen it before.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "All Mistakes Buried", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"All Mistakes Buried,\" a thriller about a junkie seeking redemption through one of those fabled Big Scores, is proof that in movies, the strength of a tale usually lies in the telling. There's nothing in this film by director Tim McCann (\"Desolation Angels\") that you have not, in one sense or another, seen before. But it's executed with such passion\u00a0 that it holds together better than you might expect.  Shot in Louisiana, with a soundtrack full of whirring cicadas and \r\ninterstate traffic sounds, the movie seems to be taking place in \r\nthe mind of its hero, Sonny (Sam Trammell of \"True Blood\"), a once \r\nsuccessful small businessman who lost his fortune and became a drug addict. Sonny \r\nlives in a scuzzy motel, smokes crack whenever he can get it, and obsesses over the days when he was \r\ncomfortably married to his kindhearted wife, Jen (Missy Yager), and \r\nrunning a successful home security operation. The story is built around an escalating series of offenses. First Sonny shoplifts a greeting card that he means to give to Jen on her birthday. Then he sneaks into a pawn shop and hides there until closing time to steal (or perhaps reclaim) a necklace for Jen. By the end of the film, he's gotten pulled into a wild, dangerous, major crime that he also justifies in Jen's name. He says all about his wife, but it's really all about Sonny\u2014his arrogance, his embarrassment at having lost so much, his craving for vindication and renewal.  Advertisement The film's screenplay is by McCann and Shaun S. Sanghani, from a story by Trammell and McCann. Its outline is very 1940s film noir, set in around a nightmarish fringe that exists adjacent to, or beneath, respectable society. This world is populated mainly by junkies, prostitutes and pimps; a hard-boiled madam (Vanessa Ferlito of \"Graceland,\" whose character has a past connection to Sonny); the night managers of a seedy motel; snarling nightclub owners; armed robbers and the like. They're mostly a tough, even cruel bunch. Look at them wrong and they'll beat you to a pulp.  As in earlier films by McCann, one of the largely unsung auteurs of American Scuzzpit Cinema, the world of \"All Mistakes Buried\" feels like the product of journalistic study or even experience (secondhand, one hopes). There's none of that Hollywood crime movie nonsense: beautiful people with beautiful teeth and beautiful hair and gorgeous clothes smoking on street corners and barking threats at each other while carefully chosen pop and rap songs blare on the soundtrack. These characters feel real, so real that you can smell their sour sweat and the stench of urine and spilled beer. (McCann has used actual ex-convicts as actors in some of his other movies, and it would not be surprised to learn that he's done the same here.)  But rather than tell its story in a strictly linear way, as an old (or mainstream) film might, \"All Mistakes Buried\" flashes back and forth through the hero's recent life in a prismatic fashion. The brilliant editing, by McCann and Chris Kursel, is reminiscent of arty 1960s and '70s films that applied the techniques of literary fiction to pulp thriller material: \"Point Blank\" and its unofficial spiritual remake \"The Limey\" are especially strong reference points here, especially when \"All Mistakes Buried\" leaves exposition behind and dives into a fugue state, blending past and present in a free-associative way. Some of its passages are so eerily beautiful that the sordid subject matter becomes ennobled, even sanctified. We seem to be looking at the hero's predicament through the eyes of a compassionate deity that wishes it could do more for this sad man.  Advertisement This technique becomes slightly irksome during the movie's second half, when Sonny gets in way over his head. The film seems to fall apart or implode, mirroring the hero's increasing distress by piling on the flash-cuts and dissolves. Certain images suggest the cover of a 1970s free-form rock album that you'd \"loan\" to a friend without expecting it to be returned. It's just too much, or not modulated enough; there are times when the film itself seems to be out of control, not just Sonny. Nevertheless, it's rare to see such an evidently low-budget film carrying itself with such aesthetic swagger. It might have cost a buck-fifty to make, but in its mind, the movie is as grandiose and heedless as Sonny.  If there were Oscars for Best Performance in a Movie Academy Voters Wouldn't be Caught Dead Watching, Trammell's performance would be a lock for a nomination. His work as Sonny doesn't just anchor the film, in many ways it is the film; nearly every second of \"All Mistakes Buried\" is anchored to Sonny's jittery, guilty, unrealistically hopeful consciousness, and it's so lively and imaginative that its baroque flourishes seem all of a piece (junkies aren't known for their subtlety). Trammell, who also acted for McCann in \"White Rabbit,\" has thought through every gesture; many of them are extreme.  And yet, as in certain \"big\" performances by actors like Dennis Hopper or Jeremy Davies, even the most flamboyant moments are rooted in psychology, such as the way Sonny hesitates before contemplatively touching his own face, or the way he seems amused or appalled by himself when he flies into a rage, spewing the f-word and waving a gun around. We're seeing a man disconnected from his essence, a consciousness uprooted from its shell. Oftentimes there's a very brief but noticeable time lapse between when Sonny's brain gives his body an order and when the body carries it out. The instantaneous eternity of that gap is filled by a flash of emotion: self-consciousness, maybe, or shame, or bitter amusement at what Sonny has become. This sense of loss is never more keenly felt than when Sonny talks to non-addicts. He puffs himself up, talks about what a great plan he has or how in-control he is or how much progress he's made, and the listener just nods patiently and waits for Sonny to ask for money.

{"Title": "I Saw the Light", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Hank Williams was arguably the first modern superstar of\r\ncountry music. There\u2019s also a sense in which you could call him a rock star,\r\nand the sense is a tragic one: he died on the way to a gig, of heart failure,\r\nafter a short lifetime of not taking terribly good care of himself\u2014age 29. His\r\nsongs remain country standards and rightly so, but there\u2019s not much room for his\r\nhaunted persona in contemporary country. Williams\u2019 son, whose name you might be\r\nable to guess, projects a much hairier and more rambunctious model and is, as\r\nsuch, more of an influence. (\u201cYou Sure Hank Done It This Way?\u201d is the name of a\r\nrueful State-Of-Country song cut by Waylon Jennings. Back in 1975, for heaven\u2019s\r\nsake.) Advertisement \u201cI Saw The Light,\u201d written and directed by Marc Abraham, is\r\na never-less-than-handsomely-mounted film biography of Williams; the\r\nparticularly outstanding cinematography is by Dante Spinotti, the craftsman who\r\nalso shot the likes of \u201cHeat\u201d and \u201cL.A. Confidential.\u201d Williams is played by\r\nthe lanky, high-cheekboned British actor Tom Hiddleston, and he\u2019s a terrific\r\nphysical match for the man himself, who had a perpetual lean-and-hungry look.\r\nHiddleston\u2019s performance is a masterful one: understated, superbly modulated,\r\nempathetic. Hiddleston can also mimic Williams\u2019 yodel-inflected singing style,\r\nwhich brought the innovation of classic country warbler Jimmie Rodgers into a\r\nmore pop-friendly realm, with impressive accuracy. While Hiddleston\u2019s is the\r\nstandout performance, and why not, the rest of the cast is formidable: Elizabeth Olsen, Cherry Jones, Bradley Whitford, David Krumholtz and a host of\r\nothers do superb work in roles of spouse, mother, business associate, and so\r\non.  And yet the movie flounders. Williams was a serious\r\nalcoholic and eventually a pain pill addict; his relationships with women were\r\nhectic, to say the least; his massive talent was complemented in the negative\r\nby a substantial and ever-increasing lack of ability to show any kind of\r\nresponsibility. The messy specifics of Williams\u2019 adult life prove too\r\nintransigent for Abraham\u2019s abilities; the writer-director can\u2019t make coherent\r\nart out of them. The key conflict\u2014at least initially\u2014in Williams\u2019 first\r\nmarriage, to Olsen\u2019s Audrey Mae, has to do with her own singing ambitions.\r\nThey\u2019re strong, but her talent is not, and this makes for a series of\r\ndiscomfiting scenes. Abraham\u2019s everyone-has-their-reasons sense of balance may\r\nbe commendable on humanist grounds, and there\u2019s no compelling reason that\r\nAudrey Mae has to be the villain in the scenario, but there\u2019s no effective\r\ntension here; the drama is flat. Later in the film, when Williams\u2019 romantic\r\nimbroglios take on a nearly farcical pitch, he behaves with staggering\r\ncallousness to one of his girlfriends (Wrenn Schmidt's Bobbie Jett) and the movie can barely\r\nshrug its shoulders. Many opportunities for character illumination are fluffed.\r\nIn a meeting with Hollywood movie mogul Dore Schary, Williams arrogantly\r\nrefuses to take off his hat for the executive. The implication is that\r\nTinseltown\u2019s too phony for Williams. Mere minutes later, Hank is doing some\r\nvery cornball schtick with an overweight comic emcee on the Grand Ole Opry\r\nradio show. This suggests a dichotomy that might have been fruitfully explored.\r\nBut it is not.  There are moments. Williams\u2019 tetchiness with a New York\r\njournalist (Krumholtz) sticks to the ribs, as does a drunken freestyle courtesy\r\nof Williams\u2019 darkling alter ego Luke the Drifter. But in the end, \u201cI Saw The\r\nLight\u201d doesn\u2019t illuminate enough to show us an entirely compelling\r\nWilliams.", "Critic": "Gamma"}

The titles of\r\nthe individual episodes are revealed after, rather than before the episodes\r\nthemselves, which tends to give said titles the quality of punchlines. Now\r\nwhile it\u2019s pretty obvious from the get-go that the \u201cR\u201d episode will be called \u201cRoulette,\u201d\r\nin other cases the punchline option is used with great brio, or as a droll\r\nformal commentary (as is the case with the \u201cS\u201d episode, directed by Juan\r\nMartinez Moreno and my absolute favorite of the bunch). What\u2019s not necessarily\r\nunsurprising is that the gimmick doesn\u2019t get as old as you\u2019d figure given\r\nits iteration. So that\u2019s good. And while early on one feels that the brevity\r\nrequired to get 26 short films into a two-hour slot is likely to impose a samey\r\nabstraction on the proceedings, that doesn\u2019t happen either. Each filmmaker\r\ntakes his or her ball and makes the most out of it.  What results is a survey of\r\nwhat\u2019s both glorious or at least intriguing about the directions in\r\ncontemporary horror, and what\u2019s problematic as well. Often at the same time.\r\nFor instance, in the aforementioned Juan Martinez Moreno episode, a\r\nhome-invasion tale distinguished by really virtuosic multi-screen manipulations\r\nof cinematic space and genuinely excruciating tension, the ghastly pause to\r\ntake in the full measure of a GAPING HEAD WOUND does\u2014not to sound like your\r\ngrandfather who remembers back when movies could be scary without all the\r\ngore\u2014feel a little gratuitous. A certain aspect of The Larger Problem With\r\nContemporary Horror is actually addressed in the next film, the \u201cT\u201d episode, a\r\nbracing and refreshingly snide\u2014and icky\u2014feminist observation from tyros Jen and\r\nSylvia Soska. Little thematic fillips of this sort help make the stretch from\r\n\u201cS\u201d to \u201cW\u201d maybe the strongest of the whole feature, and the streak is broken\r\nwith a blindingly obvious \u201cX\u201d that\u2019s surprisingly by \u201cInside\u201d maestro Julien\r\nMaury, who\u2019s defeated by getting too cute. I suppose in a cultural environment\r\nin which the word \u201cmisogynist\u201d is applied to all manner of cultural material\r\nwith less than perfect discrimination, the final episode actually achieves this\r\nstate, and does so while trying to one-up an infamous sequence from an infamous\r\nLucio Fulci movie. Points for grandstanding here go to director Chris Nash,\r\nwhose name is likely to make me get up and run the other way from hereon in. (I\r\nknow, I\u2019m giving short shrift to \u201cY\u201d here, which is the directorial debut of\r\nveteran Japanese makeup-effects artist Soichi Umezawa. And is a little better\r\nthan OK.)  Genre fans will I suppose understand me well when I say that\r\nwhile I might have only fully enjoyed fewer than half the entries in this film,\r\nI am eager to see the next installment.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Nightcrawler", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "Dan Gilroy's thriller \"Nightcrawler\" is about an amateur cameraman who parlays his eye and his nerve into a successful small business, deceiving, manipulating and exploiting everyone who stands in his way. Shot by Paul Thomas Anderson's regular cinematographer Robert Elswit through what could be a Night Vision Rot filter, it's a film about how sociopaths get over on everyone else, and a portrait of a disturbed, marginal loner that would fit perfectly on a double bill with \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.\" It's also a media satire in the spirit of \"Network\" and \"To Die For\" that takes the slogan \"If it bleeds, it leads\" to its horrifyingly logical conclusion. It's a comedy. Advertisement The movie's hero, Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), is a man living on the fringes. He's first seen trying to cut through a chain-link fence to steal scrap that he can sell for pocket money. While driving late at night, he happens upon cameramen filming a car wreck. He asks the lead cameraman (Bill Paxton) what TV station they work for, and learns that they're freelancers who monitor police radios, chase down wrecks and fires and homicides, and sell their video footage to the highest bidder. The rates aren't great, but they're better than what Lou is used to, so he buys a camera and gets in on the action.\u00a0 This leads him to a local station whose news director, Nina Romina (Rene Russo), has been up and down the dial, as a certain sitcom's theme song once sang, and needs to raise her newscast out of last place to keep from getting fired. Any idealism she had was ground out of her years ago; only desperation remains, and she speaks frankly to Lou from the moment she meets him, sensing a kindred spirit. (She has no idea how kindred: soon enough he'll cajole, pressure and even scare her into unleashing her own inner Lou.) Nina tells him to avoid covering crime in poor or nonwhite neighborhoods because nobody cares about it; the sexiest crime stories are ones involving affluent white folks. At one point she flat-out tells Lou that the newscast's aesthetic could be boiled down the the image of \"a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut.\" \u00a0The newscasters' warning \"These are extremely graphic images\" is not, of course, a warning; it's a come-on.\u00a0 Sensing a golden opportunity, Lou feeds Nina footage that's more artless than the stuff offered by other local crews, but much bloodier. It starts with shots of a domestic killing that he obtained by sneaking past crime tape and wandering around inside the gore-strewn house (blurred by Nina's technicians, but only because they're required to blur it) and escalates, to the point where Lou is subtly goosing circumstances in order to produce more violence and chaos which he can then tape and sell. Lou and his easily cowed assistant, Rick (Riz Ahmed), breach barriers they aren't supposed to breach, and get close enough to police investigators and firefighters and EMT's that they break their concentration and sometimes interfere with their work, but their literally in-your-face footage sets them apart from teams that film from a discreet distance, with a zoom lens.\u00a0 Advertisement Lou is also a sick person who, on first glance, might strike you as a reasonable, personable guy. He talks like a Tom Cruise go-getter from a 1980s hit\u2014a comparison furthered by certain filmmaking choices, such as the \"inspirational\" montages of Lou hustling toward success while James Newton Howard's\u00a0triumphant retro synth-pop pounds in our eardrums. The hero gets a number of Stick-it-to-the-Man applause lines, the best of which is a kiss-off to a rival who has figured out that Lou is for real and wants to co-opt him rather than compete with him. \"I feel like grabbing you by the ears right now and screaming, 'I'm not fucking interested,'\" Lou tells him, in the sort of tone one might reserve for, \"What are your store hours?\" or \"I'll have a mushroom omelet, cooked with very little butter.\"\u00a0 But it would be a mistake to suggest that \"Nightcrawler\" is told from Lou's point-of-view, much less that it endorses his behavior. It's too attuned to the anxiety and misery of the people he manipulates to validate such a reading. But it does put a subtle editorial frame around Lou's odyssey. \u00a0\"Nightcrawler\" is the blackly comedic, Neo-noir, night-people thriller that I wanted the Travis-Bickle-as-Superman fantasy \"Drive\" to be. Like \"Drive,\" it could be described as the best picture Michael Mann never made: a film about a private, ruthless loner who pursues his dream his way, always, and whose path through the world is marked by the bloodstains of the people he's rolled over.\u00a0 This is a classic film, not just because every scene and line is casually beautiful and devoid of extraneous touches, but because its tone is mercilessly exact.\u00a0Gilroy, a first-time feature director who has written or cowritten many movies, including \"The Bourne Supremacy,\" knows what he wants to say, and how to say it. He maintains just the right amount of distance from Lou, so that we get a buzz from his audacity while finding him revolting. We're not so much looking down on Lou as peering into an abyss that exists, to some degree, within everyone: the lightless home of that little voice that whispers, \"You've just gotta do what makes you happy,\" and \"It is easier to ask forgiveness than permission.\"\u00a0 Advertisement There's a lively satirical aspect, and it's not confined to TV news or journalism in general, or even the modern, social media-driven culture of continuous surveillance and voyeurism.\u00a0The entire film is, among other things, an attempt to treat certain American myths straightforwardly, within the context of a somewhat realistic drama, the better to pursue them to their bitter conclusion. It's warning against being fooled (in life) by people who remind us of\u00a0can-do-All-American-hotshot\u00a0heroes in fiction: incarnations of apple pie capitalism who see what they want (fame, money, a job, a mate), and go after it, and refuse to take no for an answer, even if the \"no\" is delivered through tears. \u00a0 That tabloid journalism rewards the shameless doesn't count as a breaking news flash, but \"Nightcrawler\" is not interested in stoking our outrage over what we already know. It's using TV news as a means to an end\u2014to show how a man who presents as \"normal,\" even \"likable\" and \"motivated\" and \"capable,\" can be evil, and seduce us into being evil, too.\u00a0Lou's inspirational aphorisms are chillingly funny once you realize they're devoid of generosity and decency, and that he sees other people only as\u00a0possessions, allies\u00a0or obstructions: \"I believe that good things come to those who work their asses off.\" \"Television news might be something I love as well as something I'm good at.\"\u00a0Primitive cultures believe a photograph can steal a soul.

{"Title": "Bird People", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Pascale Ferran\u2019s \u201cBird People\u201d contains two complementary\r\ndramas within its unique structure; neither of them completely work. While\r\nthere are some phenomenal twists of the narrative knife in this unique story of\r\na flier who grounds himself and an earthbound woman who takes flight, \u201cBird\r\nPeople\u201d also includes wildly aggravating tonal and pacing issues. It\u2019s a film\r\nabout jumping into the void, taking that risk that we have all considered\r\ntaking at one point or another in our lives. We all reach moments in our\r\nexistence where we\u2019re tempted to just take flight, leave the world behind.\r\nFamily, friends and obligations usually keep us from doing so, but the urge to\r\nleave it all behind never fully disappears. Advertisement Gary (the always-good Josh Charles, who reportedly got this\r\npart through his fantastic work on \u201cIn Treatment\u201d) is the man who jumps into\r\nthat void when he decides, after a few dull business meetings, that he\u2019s not\r\nleaving Paris. He\u2019s not going on to his next meeting in Dubai. He\u2019s not\r\nreturning home to the States. He\u2019s quitting his job. He\u2019s leaving his wife and\r\nfamily. And he\u2019s not even sure what he\u2019s doing next or where he\u2019s going next. Gary\r\ncalls his co-workers and breaks the news. And he has an emotional, devastating\r\nconversation with his wife (Radha Mitchell) via Skype. In detailed, heartbreaking beats, we watch a man tell his partner that he won\u2019t be coming home. Sure, there\u2019s\r\nan implication of love lost between the two of them a long time ago, but it\u2019s\r\nstill hard to fathom a man leaving so much responsibility behind him like an\r\nunused plane ticket. After Gary\u2019s life has been disassembled to the point that he\u2019s\r\nfree from all tethers, a maid named Audrey (Ana\u00efs Demoustier) similarly throws\r\noff her traditional structure in a way that I won\u2019t spoil (but the title\r\ncertainly hints at it). The second half of \u201cBird People\u201d replaces the realism\r\nof the first half with fantasy elements that thematically complement the first.\r\nThis is a film about people breaking free, and when they realize that common\r\nsubtext to their lives at the end of the story, it has some undeniable thematic\r\nresonance. However, it takes WAY too long to get there. Ferran is prone\r\nto \u201cflights of fancy,\u201d pardon the pun, as some scenes in her film go on unchecked while others aren\u2019t allowed nearly the right amount of time to develop.\r\nThe scene in which Gary officially breaks his marriage is interminable, with\r\nlong silences and what sound like improvised emotional beats. I\u2019m sure one\r\ncould argue that this enhances the realism of the scene, but that doesn\u2019t make\r\nit entertaining. And the key fantasy sequence in the movie is one that I never\r\nthought would end. There\u2019s a much stronger, tighter, captivating version of \u201cBird\r\nPeople\u201d buried in this bloated take on a unique story. \u201cBird People\u201d is a movie for which it\u2019s tempting to make\r\nexcuses. I like Charles\u2019 work here. As he was on \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d he\u2019s so\r\ncompletely in the moment. He doesn\u2019t overplay beats, and I hope he soon gets a\r\npart that really takes him to the next level in terms of international\r\nattention. Demoustier is a charming young actress. And there are clearly\r\ninteresting ideas taking flight here. It\u2019s the execution of the flight plan\r\nthat keeps them from reaching their destination. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "God's Own Country", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Johnny Saxby, the protagonist of Francis Lee\u2019s impressive feature directorial debut, \u201cGod\u2019s Own Country,\u201d is a difficult character to like for quite a while. When first we see him, he\u2019s hunched over a toilet bowl, contending with the semi-dry-heaves that are familiar to alcoholics and younger fellows with delicate stomachs. Johnny may be one or the other, or both. In any event, puking is not a good look for him, particularly in cold rural morning light. Once in repose, or something like it, Johnny initially\u2014there\u2019s no way of getting around this\u2014brings to mind the phrase I think I first heard in a Monty Python sketch, that is \u201cspotty-faced git.\u201d Advertisement Johnny is the scion of a small farming family in Britain\u2019s Pennine Mountains, a Northern region of England. When I say small farming family, I mean it: he is the only son of Deidre and Martin, two older folks who look as if rural existence has beaten the life out of them. Father Martin is in fact disabled, hobbled after a stroke. This leaves Johnny to look after the livestock, and the looking after of the livestock is portrayed in vivid detail. If you are made squeamish by Explicit Calving Action, and the aftermath thereof, this might not be a movie for you.    Aside from carrying the weight of the farm on his shoulders\u2014which he does poorly\u2014Johnny has another issue. He\u2019s gay, which one infers does not go down well either with his immediate family or the extremely lumpen residents of the tiny town where Johnny goes for his drink. Johnny\u2019s world is shaken up a bit when Gheorghe, a Romanian immigrant with extensive experience and competence in tasks Johnny seems entirely indifferent to, arrives to temp at the farm. Gheorghe is handsome, confident, friendly. All of which annoys both Johnny and Martin no end at first.    Once Gheorghe and Johnny get to work at an area of the farm far removed from the main house, their seeming hostility to each other gives way to something else. Once they\u2019ve made love in the mud, they begin to bond. An unusual kind of Eden conjures itself up. The animals start to thrive (or at least do better) under Gheorghe\u2019s tender, knowing ministrations, and Johnny himself opens up. He not only starts smiling more, he actually gets better-looking.    \u201cGod\u2019s Own Country\u201d is a tricky movie, but not in a way that\u2019s dishonest. Its first feet are in the school of miserablist realism, and while director Lee never abandons his things-as-they-are approach, he tells a love story by letting magic in at unusual angles. Most of which involve, yes, God\u2019s own country, a ravishing landscape captured beautifully by the cinematography of Joshua James Williams. The land can be contended with, inhabited, but it can\u2019t ever be tamed, is what the images tell us.    Advertisement So too it is with life itself. After Johnny\u2019s father suffers another stroke, Johnny and Gheorghe have to face the question: do they have the conviction to try and make their situation, both personal and professional, permanent? Homophobia is not the only potential issue here. When Johnny take Gheorghe to his local pub, Gheorghe is disrespected by a xenophobic older townie. The \u201cwhat will Mom think\u201d issue is actually resolved in a way that\u2019s surprising and moving, as is so much in the movie.    \u201cGod\u2019s Own Country\u201d asks a lot of its actors, physically and emotionally, and they come through. Josh O\u2019Connor navigates Johnny\u2019s soddenness and transformation with exceptional sensitivity. As Gheorghe, Alec Secareanu brings matinee-idol looks, easy charm, and palpable thoughtfulness to bear. Gemma Jones and Ian Hart play Johnny\u2019s parents, and despite a two-decade age gap between the actors, they are perfectly matched and in a sense, unrecognizable; they could very well be rural folks discovered by the director.    The movie\u2019s denouement was ever so slightly sentimental for my tastes, but overall this is a pretty exceptional find; a solid story about how committing to what you believe in requires finding out what you believe in first.

{"Title": "Patriots Day", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Patriots\u00a0Day,\" the third collaboration between star Mark Wahlberg and director Peter Berg, and the second in 2016 alone (the first being \"Deepwater Horizon\"), is about the terrorist bombing at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, which killed three people and wounded hundreds, and details the unprecedented citywide manhunt that took place over the following week, a week when all of Boston was shut down.\u00a0 It starts with a scene showing fictional cop Sgt. Tommy Saunders (Wahlberg) doing a routine drug bust. The point of the scene is to show that Saunders had been suspended earlier in the year, and is now given humiliating assignments like working the finish line of the Boston Marathon (occurring the following day). Saunders bristles at the thought of doing crowd control instead of what he sees as real police work. Of course, only a couple of hours later, Saunders is in the center of the bombing, where he rises to the occasion. This doesn't feel right, and his personal redemption story doesn't feel right either. The real-life investigators and real-life Boston cops who did the actual work provide so many examples of heroism and courage that the stories could fill a library. Berg and Wahlberg avoided this trap in the much more effective \"Deepwater Horizon,\" which focused solely on the event itself and the terrible impact it had on the people who worked on that rig. Thankfully, Saunders\u2014while ostensibly the main character\u2014plays his role in the midst of a huge ensemble: citizens, FBI agents, government officials, Boston cops, cops in nearby Watertown where terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was eventually discovered hiding in a boat in someone's backyard. And it is this story, the real story, that saves \"Patriots\u00a0Day.\" Advertisement Berg, who wrote the script with Matt Cook and Joshua Zetumer, zips around in the narrative, starting with the opening sequence showing the morning of the marathon, as experienced by characters who will play major roles in the days to come: young couple Jessica Kensky (Rachel Brosnahan) and Patrick Downes (Christopher O'Shea), Northeastern student Dun Meng (Jimmy O. Yang), fresh-faced MIT policeman Sean Collier (Jack Picking), Watertown police Sergeant Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese (J.K. Simmons), and Saunders, bitching to his wife (Michelle Monaghan) about having to put on a day-glo vest. We also see Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (Alex Wolff) and his brother Tamerlan (Themo Melikidze) hanging out at their dark, depressing apartment, making their final preparations, all as Tamerlan's wife (Melissa Benoist) bitches that her husband didn't buy the right kind of milk. Combined with the thrumming score from Trent Reznor, and stunning aerial shots of Boston at sunrise, this opening sequence creates the anticipatory dread of the events to come. As with \"Deepwater Horizon\" (where the special effects had such grit that you could practically feel the heat of the fire), the bombing, when it happens, is sudden and visceral.\u00a0 \"Patriots\u00a0Day\" kicks into real gear once the investigation starts. Big-wigs descend: FBI special agent Richard DesLauriers (Kevin Bacon), Commissioner Ed Davis (John Goodman), Boston Mayor Thomas Menino (Vincent Curatola), Governor Deval Patrick (Michael Beach), fight over the best way to proceed, all as FBI agents hole up with CCTV footage and cell-phone videos, looking for possible suspects. Berg is on sure ground here, and it shows. The story is simplified into its urgent essence: Who did this? Where are they? Are there more bombs? Competent people focused on working a problem are fascinating to watch.\u00a0 On a separate track is the bumbling incompetent getaway of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan. Their plans to get to New York and set off more bombs derails almost immediately. The carjacking and abduction of Dun Meng, aimlessly driving around the outer environs of Boston trying to figure out what to do next, lead up to Meng's thrilling (and insanely brave) escape and it's clearly the story element that Berg finds most cinematic and interesting. Berg spends the most time here. There's an unevenness to the pacing because of it, but it's in this long sequence (the longest in the film) that the Tsarnaev dynamic is most clearly evident: Tamerlan is the panicking ferocious big brother and Dzhokar is the oblivious punk kid brother, wondering out loud if there's an iPod port in the SUV and whining about Tamerlan not letting him drive. The thought process leading up to their actions is unexplored. Dzhokar, in particular, seems incapable of deep thought in any way whatsoever. There are incongruous moments of humor, as poor Meng tries to bargain with his captors, pleading for his life, until he finally realizes they are not going to let him go and whatever happens, no one is coming to save him and he must save himself. Advertisement Was Tamerlan's mysterious wife involved? What did she know? There's an interrogation scene that yields no clues (and to this day, Katherine Russell\u00a0has not been charged with anything). Did Dzokhar realize the kind of trouble he could get into? Alex Wolff plays the role on its surface, and it's a frightening and effective choice. He pouts and makes jokes, showing that he does not quite grasp the enormity of what he has done. Meanwhile, under intense pressure, the multi-tentacled investigation masses up around them until there is no way out. These events are familiar: we all watched them happen on the news (I was at Ebertfest at the time: my whole family is from Boston, and one of my mother's closest friends lives in the neighborhood where Dzokhar was finally found, and was texting my mother updates on the chaos unfolding outside), but Berg and company have recreated them in a gripping and immediate narrative. The hero worship of a fictional character in the midst of all of this real-life drama is a mistake. A down-on-his-luck cop finds himself\u00a0essential to a huge\u00a0federal investigation, stumbling into\u00a0the\u00a0center of every major moment in the search and capture that followed, even to the point where\u00a0beloved designated hitter for the Boston Red Sox, David Ortiz, reaches out to shake his hand\u2014personally\u2014just prior to walking out onto the field at Fenway Park and making a now-famous and cathartic speech\u00a0to the crowd. It's too much. The hero of \"Patriots\u00a0Day\" is the community of Boston, not a fictional guy played by a movie star (albeit a famous Bostonian).\u00a0 Fred (\"Mr.\") Rogers once said, \u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.'\" The quote is thrown around a lot in times of catastrophe but that does not lessen its truth. If you've been through a terrorist attack, or a natural disaster, or any violent event, then you know that Mr. Rogers is right. Disaster strikes, and there are those who rush to the scene to help in any way they can. It's inspirational in the purest sense of the word. \"Patriots\u00a0Day\" is at its best when it focuses on the real-life people\u2014first responders, overwhelmed emergency room doctors, local policemen and FBI agents, those manning the phones for citizen tips, the hacker-types analyzing mounds of video footage\u2014who ran to the middle of the maelstrom and got busy helping, the living embodiment of \"Boston Strong.\" Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}

Junior's mother Marta (Samantha Castillo), harassed and exhausted, sees\r\n her son's obsession with his hair as an ominous sign. When she looks at\r\n him, more often than not it is with an expression of disgust.

What is it like to know who you are before you understand what\r\n that will mean? Populated with totally naturalistic performances, and a\r\n stunningly observed relationship between mother and son (their scenes \r\ntogether are phenomenal), \"Bad Hair\" works by keeping its focus on the \r\nsmall details of everyday life and its rhythms. It is not didactic about\r\n sexuality, and it does not sentimentalize childhood or its main child \r\ncharacter. Advertisement \r\nShot by Micaela Cajahuaringa with an intensely realistic style, \"Bad \r\nHair\" presents a world that is overcrowded, loud, and chaotic. People \r\ndon't have time to think in this cacophony. There is no room to breathe. \r\nPoverty and overcrowding grind people down. The highways are clogged \r\nwith cars, and the gigantic dilapidated tenement buildings loom high, \r\nsurrounded by the vast space of basketball courts and parking lots. \r\nEarly on, Junior and his best friend (Maria Emilia Sulbaran) stand on \r\nhis balcony, staring at the wall of windows across the way, the sheer \r\nsea of diverse humanity on display, packed on top of one another, and \r\nthey speculate on the lives everyone leads over there.

It is in total contrast to the jagged hip-hop\r\n energy of the other boys, but in such a moment Junior is being himself.\r\n It is pure joy. Marta comes across this scene, takes one look at how \r\ndifferent Junior looks from everyone else, and drags him away, asking \r\nhim why he has to dance like that.

She \r\nplays him pop songs, and dances around, singing into a hairbrush. She \r\nstraightens his hair for him, too, warning him to put water on it before\r\n Marta arrives to pick him up.

Carmen suggests that Junior come live with her \r\nfor good. \"He likes to look nice and dress up,\" Carmen says bluntly. \r\n\"You don't like that.\" \r\nJunior is at the mercy of the adults around him.

She balks: \"I need to be a role model for my kids.\" She does not \r\nunderstand what she is doing. Samantha Castillo is fearless in what is \r\nan extremely unpleasant and complex role. \r\nMarta and Junior are locked in a battle of the wills. The hair becomes \r\nthe symbol of the much larger issue that Marta senses (and Junior is too\r\n young to realize). It is a macho and rough world and Marta thinks her \r\nson is too effeminate. Junior's innocent crush on the teenage boy who \r\nruns the newsstand in the projects is seen as an incredibly sinister \r\ndevelopment. To Junior, he just wants straight hair and wants to look \r\nfabulous in his school photo. He is struggling to blossom. Little Samuel\r\n Lange Zambrano is a revelation. He stares at his mother for long \r\nperiods of time as she sews on the couch, and you can see his entire \r\nuniverse\u2014betrayal and sadness and longing for her\u2014on his face. He is an \r\namazing young actor. Advertisement \r\nTold in a slow and deliberate manner, with documentary-style realism, \r\n\"Bad Hair\" is not conventional storytelling, but it is all the more \r\neffective because of that. The scenes between Marta and Junior, often \r\nplaying out in one take, are rich with behavior, and sharp glances, \r\nsudden changes in mood (sometimes violent) and spontaneous reactions in \r\nthe moment. Their dynamic feels dangerous, a live wire coiling about the\r\n room. Mariana Rond\u00f3n has created a powerful and very human story about a\r\n young child's growing sense of self, and his innocent and baffled \r\nreactions to adult resistance and cruelty. \"Bad Hair\" is extremely \r\nprovocative in its quiet way, and pulls none of its punches. What will \r\nhappen to Junior, I found myself worrying. Can't everyone just let him be? Rond\u00f3n, a major talent, is not afraid to \r\nfollow her story to its logically bleak conclusion, but the end-credits \r\nsequence suggests hope.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "The story of the USS Indianapolis is one of the most harrowing in United States history. The Navy ship, a heavy cruiser, was tasked with a top-secret mission in the last days of World War II, delivering components for the A-bomb that would be dropped on Hiroshima, helping to end that war. (It was simply impossible for a plane carrying that bomb to fly from the United States to Japan.) After making the delivery to Guam, the ship took off, once again under a cloak of secrecy. But it was sunk by a Japanese sub and about a quarter of its men went down with the ship. About 900 other sailors clung to life rafts with scant supplies awaiting a rescue that was probably never going to come, given the nature of their mission. During the four-day interval before their discovery, the men were beset by sharks. (The character of Quint in \u201cJaws,\u201d played by Robert Shaw, tells its story therein.) 317 survived. Things weren\u2019t subsequently very rosy for one of the survivors, the ship\u2019s commander, Captain Charles McVay. In what\u2019s today widely seen as an example of internecine Navy scapegoating, McVay was court-martialed and convicted of hazarding his ship. He was posthumously exonerated by President Clinton in 2000.  Advertisement You\u2019d think, maybe, that they\u2019d have made a movie about this event a long time ago. But if you thought harder immediately thereafter, you\u2019d understand why they didn\u2019t. Not only is the story in its particulars mind-blowingly grisly, it\u2019s not one to which a filmmaker can easily apply an inspirational message. There\u2019s also the logistical difficulty of depicting men floating in the ocean and fending off shark attacks for several days. As it happens, there was a made-for-television movie made about the events for CBS, \u201cMission of the Shark,\u201d and network standards and practices ensured that it didn\u2019t even try to depict the events accurately. In the hands of filmmakers with the will and means to contrive a realistic simulation of events, the results would be unwatchable. The movie \u201cUSS Indianapolis: Men of Courage\u201d is not exactly unwatchable, but it\u2019s also completely not worthy of watching. The movie begins with Japanese planes having at the Indianapolis, and the scene looks like a video game, and not a particularly good one either. Into this shameless fakery steps, goodness gracious, Nicolas Cage, in his 648th starring role of 2016, as Captain McVay, who at one point looks into the camera and intones \u201cThere will always be war until we kill ourselves off as a species.\u201d He\u2019s talking, as it happens, to a framed photo of his wife, to whom he\u2019s writing a letter, but it\u2019s still disconcerting. There\u2019s a lot of disconcerting in the movie\u2019s opening scenes. Navy brass concocting the mission in Washington D.C. are shown as very contemporary clich\u00e9 villains; they all talk like ceegar-chomping variations of Larry The Cable Guy as they discuss their strategy to end the war. To paraphrase Waylon Jennings, are you sure Harry Truman done it this way? I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 Continuing the lazy inattention to period detail, we are soon treated to the sight of a burlesque dancer with obvious breast implants entertaining our boys. One sailor makes reference to \u201clean, mean, fighting machines.\u201d Okay. Some of the young Navy men are given quirky character traits\u2014one is keeping a poetic journal of his observations, such as \u201cThe streets are alive \u2026 and the sailors \u2026 are on the prowl to night!\u201d There are others who have their extremely particular at-home dilemmas to solve once they return from the war, as for instance a romantic triangle half-filched from \u201cLove Actually\u201d featuring Cody Walker, Adam Scott Miller and Emily Tennant. There is some depiction of racial tensions between the sailors, and this is commendable in theory, but not in practice. So much of the dialogue is so bad, and the situations so hackneyed, that the question of \u201cWhat would a World War II movie written by Tommy Wiseau sound like?\u201d in case you\u2019ve ever asked it, is herein answered. (The script is actually by Cam Cannon and Richard Rionda Del Castro, who\u2019ve worked with Cage before on 2014\u2019s \u201cRage.\u201d) And in case you\u2019re wondering why the scenarists went to so much trouble with these storylines, it\u2019s merely so they could play shark roulette with the characters when the ship goes down. The \u201cand then some of them got run over by a truck, only in this case a grey dead-eyed truck with sharp teeth\u201d approach is crass enough that one wonders just where the idea that this movie was honoring he sacrifice of the real-life Indianapolis sailors could possibly have come from.  Advertisement The movie is directed by Mario Van Peebles, who\u2019s been behind the camera for some at-least-engaging pictures in the past. It would be a bad play on words to say that he\u2019s out of his depth here, so let\u2019s just aver that his reach here definitively exceeds his grasp. As formidably, teeth-grindingly bad as much of the movie is, near the end there\u2019s a scene that\u2019s almost affecting, one in which Cage\u2019s McVay has a quiet, pained conversation with the Japanese sub commander who sank his ship, played by Yutaka Takeuchi. Two minutes of sincerity don\u2019t make up for two-hours plus of bumbling and pandering, though.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead: The Story of the National Lampoon", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "If you\u2019re a scholar of comedy, \u201cDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead:\r\nThe Story of the National Lampoon,\u201d a concise doc about the founding, life,\r\nthriving, and death of the '70s-defining satirical magazine, is likely a\r\nmust-see. It\u2019s an engaging and entertaining film, filled with funny anecdotes\r\nexpertly related. It contains some notable \u201cget\u201d interviews. The magazine\u2019s\r\nreticent co-founder, Henry Beard, the buttoned-down superego to his Wildman\r\ncohort Doug Kenney, appears on camera throughout, which was a surprise to me:\r\nBeard, while still an active writer and editor, has kept a downright reclusive\r\npublic profile in the years since the magazine folded.  Advertisement Of course, if you are a scholar of comedy, you probably\r\nalready own the coffee table book, edited by former Lampoon contributor Rick\r\nMeyerowitz, also called \u201cDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead,\u201d which tells the story of\r\nthe magazine and some of its most notorious staffers. That book also features\r\ngenerous samplings of the magazine\u2019s work, which the movie, directed by Douglas\r\nTirola, can only offer piecemeal, or mutated via animation, a very popular\r\ntactic in documentaries nowadays. What the movie offers that the book can\u2019t are\r\nexciting clips from the Lampoon\u2019s stage show, which featured performances by\r\nfuture screen comedy icons such as Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Christopher\r\nGuest, Gilda Radner, and many more. The movie does an excellent job of\r\nchronicling how those stage shows gave rise to \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which\r\ncreated a huge talent drain at the magazine, and how the film \u201cNational\r\nLampoon\u2019s Animal House,\u201d while a huge unexpected monster hit that vindicated the\r\ninsight of the magazine staffers who conceived it, also diffused the energies of\r\nsome of the magazine\u2019s visionaries.  These chronicles are interspersed with a lot of things you\r\nsee too much of these days in docs about cultural phenomenons: interviews with celebrities\r\nwho tell you why the cultural phenom under examination here was really\r\nimportant and stuff, animated recreations of particularly outrageous anecdotes, and poignancy. The story of Kenney, who died in a hiking accident in Hawaii in\r\n1980, is played out like something out of a Fitzgerald tale with longer hair,\r\nwhile the passing of anger-management failure Michael O\u2019Donoghue elicits a bit\r\nless in terms of warm sentiment.  As watchable as the movie is, it\u2019s an almost relentlessly incurious history. The founders of the\r\nmagazine, and its admirers, go on at some length about what outsiders Beard and Kenney were as they\r\ntried to pitch their spinoff of the Harvard Lampoon to Madison Avenue in the\r\nlate 1960s. Yes, you read that right: the Harvard Lampoon. No one can be\r\nbothered to point out that an \u201coutsider\u201d coming from Harvard is still, um,\r\ncoming from Harvard. The doc is similarly unconcerned with the fact that the\r\nmagazine was by and large not just a boy\u2019s club but also a white boy\u2019s club. It\u2019s not as if the Lampoon\r\ndidn\u2019t butt heads with feminist forces during its actual existence, and the\r\ncanard about women not being funny is far from dead. So it would have been nice\r\nto hear from, say, writer Anne Beatts about this, as entertaining as her\r\nanecdote \u00a0about getting into the mag by dint of having been a male staffer\u2019s\r\ngirlfriend. And while a few black performers are seen in stills from the\r\nLampoon\u2019s stage show, the overall aesthetic that comes across in the movie is\r\nso almost relentlessly white that one almost has to ask: could Beard, P.J.\r\nO\u2019Rourke, Sean Kelly, or any of these guys, even ever conceive of having an\r\nAfrican-American writer in on an edit meeting? Except nobody making this movie\r\ndid. Which, admittedly, doesn\u2019t amount to anything like a massive social\r\ninjustice, unless, maybe you stop for a minute and look hard at what the\r\nmagazine was satirizing.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Interstellar", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Christopher\r\nNolan\u2019s\u00a0\"Interstellar,\" about astronauts traveling to the other end of the galaxy to find a new home to\r\nreplace humanity\u2019s despoiled home-world, is frantically busy and earsplittingly\r\nloud. It uses booming music to jack up the excitement level of scenes that\r\nmight not otherwise excite. It features characters shoveling exposition at each\r\nother for almost three hours, and a few of those characters have no character\r\nto speak of: they\u2019re mouthpieces for techno-babble and philosophical\r\ndebate. And for all of the director\u2019s activism on behalf of shooting on film,\r\nthe tactile beauty of the movie\u2019s 35mm and 65mm textures isn\u2019t matched by a sense of composition. The camera rarely tells the story in\r\nNolan\u2019s movies. More often it illustrates the screenplay, and there are\r\npoints in this one where I felt as if I was watching the most expensive NBC\r\npilot ever made. Advertisement And\r\nyet \"Interstellar\" is still an\r\nimpressive, at times astonishing movie that\r\noverwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted\r\naway. I\u2019ve packed the first paragraph of this review with those objections\r\n(they could apply to any Nolan picture post \"Batman\r\nBegins\"; he is who he is) so that people know that he\u2019s still doing the\r\nthings that Nolan always does. Whether you find those things endearing or\r\nirritating will depend on your affinity for Nolan's style.\u00a0 In any case, there\u2019s something pure and powerful about this movie.\u00a0I\r\ncan\u2019t recall a science fiction film hard-sold to a director\u2019s fans as multiplex-\u201cawesome\u201d\r\nin which so many major characters wept openly in close-up, voices breaking, tears streaming down\u00a0their\u00a0cheeks. Matthew\r\nMcConaughey\u2019s widowed astronaut Cooper and his colleague Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) pour\r\non the waterworks in multiple scenes, with justification: like everyone on the\r\ncrew of the Endurance, the starship\r\nsent to a black hole near Jupiter that will slingshot the heroes towards colonize-able worlds, they\u2019re separated from everything\r\nthat defines them: their loved ones, their personal histories, their culture,\r\nthe planet itself. Other characters\u2014including Amelia's father, an astrophysicist played by Michael Caine, and a space explorer (played by an\u00a0un-billed\u00a0guest actor) who\u2019s holed up on a forbidding\r\narctic world\u2014express a vulnerability to loneliness and\r\ndoubt that\u2019s quite raw for this director.\u00a0The film\u2019s central family (headed by Cooper, grounded after the\u00a0dismantling\u00a0of NASA) lives on a\u00a0corn\u00a0farm, for goodness\u2019 sake, like the gentle Iowans in \"Field of Dreams\"\u00a0(a film whose daddy-issues-laden story syncs up nicely with the narrative of\u00a0\"Interstellar\"). Granted, they're growing the crop to feed the human race, which is whiling away its twilight hours on a planet so ecologically devastated that at first you mistake it for the American Dust Bowl circa 1930 or so; but there's still something amusingly cheeky about the notion of corn as sustenance, especially in a survival story in which the future of humanity is at stake. (Ellen Burstyn plays one of many witnesses in a documentary first glimpsed in the movie's opening scene\u2014and which, in classic Nolan style, is a setup for at least two twists.)  The state-of-the-art sci-fi landscapes are deployed in service of Hallmark\r\ncard homilies about how people should live, and what\u2019s really important. (\"We love people who have died\u2014what's the social utility in that?\" \"Accident is the first step in evolution.\") After a\r\ncertain point it sinks in, or should sink in, that Nolan and his\r\nco-screenwriter, brother Jonathan Nolan, aren\u2019t trying to one-up the\r\nspectacular rationalism of \u201c2001.\" The movie's science fiction trappings are just a wrapping for a spiritual/emotional dream about basic human desires (for home, for family, for\r\ncontinuity of bloodline and culture), as well as for a horror film of sorts\u2014one that\r\ntreats the star voyagers\u2019 and their earthbound loved ones\u2019 separation as spectacular metaphors for what happens when the people we value are taken from us by death, illness, or unbridgeable distance. (\u201cPray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face,\u201d another astronaut says, after years alone in an interstellar wilderness.)\u00a0 While \"Interstellar\" never entirely commits to the idea of a non-rational, uncanny world, it nevertheless has a mystical strain, one that's unusually pronounced for a director whose storytelling has the right-brained sensibility of an engineer, logician, or accountant. There's\u00a0a ghost in this film, writing out messages to the\r\nliving in dust. Characters strain to\r\ninterpret distant radio messages as if they were ancient texts written in a\r\ndead language, and stare through red-rimmed eyes at video messages sent years ago, by people\r\non the other side of the cosmos. \"Interstellar\"\u00a0features a family haunted by the memory of a dead mother and then an absent father; a woman haunted by the memory of a missing father, and another woman who's separated from her own dad (and mentor), and driven to reunite with a lover separated from her by so many millions of miles that he might as well be dead.\u00a0 Advertisement With\r\nthe possible exception of the last act of \"Memento\"\u00a0and the pit sequence in \"The Dark Knight\r\nRises\"\u2014a knife-twisting hour that was all about suffering and transcendence\u2014I can\u2019t think of a Nolan film that ladles on\u00a0misery and\u00a0valorizes\u00a0gut feeling (faith)\u00a0the way this one does; not from start to finish, anyway. \u00a0The\u00a0most stirring sequences are less about driving the plot forward than contemplating what the characters' actions mean to them, and to us. The\u00a0best of these is the lift-off sequence, which starts with a countdown heard over images of Cooper leaving his family. It continues in space, with Caine reading passages from Dylan Thomas's villanelle \"Do Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night\": \"Old age should burn and rave at close of day;\u00a0Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\" (If it wasn't already obvious, this sequence certifies\u00a0Nolan as the most death-and-control obsessed major American filmmaker, along with Wes Anderson.) The film's widescreen panoramas feature harsh interplanetary landscapes, shot in cruel Earth locales; some of the largest and most\r\ndetailed starship miniatures ever built, and space sequences presented\r\nin scientifically accurate silence, a la \"2001.\" But for all its high-tech glitz, \"Interstellar\"\u00a0has a defiantly old-movie feeling. It's not afraid to switch, even lurch, between modes. At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes\r\nthe tough-tender spirit of a John Ford picture, or a Steven Spielberg film made\r\nin the spirit of a Ford picture: a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one. Bruising outer-space action sequences, with astronauts tumbling in zero gravity and striding across forbidding landscapes, give way to\u00a0snappy comic patter (mostly between Cooper and the ship's robot, TARS, designed in Minecraft-style, pixel-ish boxes, and voiced by Bill Irwin). There are long explanatory sequences, done with and without dry erase boards, dazzling vistas that are less spaces than mind-spaces, and tearful separations and reconciliations that might as well be played silent, in tinted black-and-white, and scored with a saloon piano. (Spielberg originated \"Interstellar\" in 2006, but dropped out to direct other projects.) McConaughey, a super-intense actor who wholeheartedly commits to every line and moment he's given, is the right leading man for this kind of film. Cooper proudly identifies himself as an engineer as well as an astronaut and farmer, but he has the soul of a goofball poet; when he stares at intergalactic vistas, he grins like a kid at an amusement park waiting to ride a new roller coaster. Cooper's farewell to his daughter Murph\u2014who's played by McKenzie Foy as a young girl\u2014is shot very close-in, and lit in warm, cradling tones; it has some of the tenderness of the porch swing scene in \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" When Murph grows up into Jessica Chastain\u2014a key member of Caine's NASA crew, and a surrogate for the daughter that the elder Brand \"lost' to the Endurance's mission\u2014we keep thinking about that goodbye scene, and how its anguish drives everything that Murph and Cooper are trying to do, while also realizing that similar feelings drive the other characters\u2014indeed, the rest of the species. (One suspects this is a deeply personal film for Nolan: it's about a man who feels he has been \"called\" to a particular job, and whose work requires him to spend long periods away from his family.) Advertisement The movie's storytelling masterstroke comes from adherence to principles of relativity: the astronauts perceive time differently depending on where Endurance is, which means that when they go down onto a prospective habitable world, a few minutes there equal weeks or months back on the ship. Meanwhile, on Earth, everyone is aging and losing hope. Under such circumstances, even tedious housekeeping-type exchanges become momentous: one has to think twice before arguing about what to do next, because while the argument is happening, people elsewhere are going grey, or suffering depression from being alone, or withering and dying. Here, more so than in any other Nolan film (and that's saying a lot), time is everything. \"I'm an old physicist,\" Brand tells Cooper early in the film. \"I'm afraid of time.\" Time is something we all fear. There's a \r\nticking clock governing every aspect of existence, from the global to \r\nthe familial. Every act by every character is an act of defiance, born \r\nof a wish to not go gently.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Jessabelle", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "There are a lot of dark family secrets in \"Jessabelle,\" involving drawers of forgotten objects, Voodoo ceremonies in the woods, \r\nand VHS tapes containing ominous messages from beyond the grave. Steeped\r\n in Southern Gothic melodrama, \"Jessabelle\" is interesting in some of \r\nthe small details, and in its strong sense of the Louisiana bayou \r\natmosphere, and then it completely falls apart when it starts being a \r\nhorror film. The trauma in the family story is full of potential, having\r\n to do with identity and how Jessabelle understands her own life, but \r\nall of that is short-changed for cheap scares that just are not scary \r\nenough and a preposterous plot that won't withstand the most cursory \r\nexamination. Director Kevin Greutert, after directing multiple entries \r\nin the \"Saw\" franchise, feels adrift in tamer material. He responds to \r\nthe Flannery O'Connor-esque qualities of the script (written by Robert \r\nBen Garant), and there are details there that ring really true, but then\r\n he falls back on a lot of tired tropes from other horror films, missing\r\n the mark almost every step of the way. Advertisement In\r\n the opening scene, Jessabelle (Sarah Snook) is about to move in with \r\nher boyfriend: she's pregnant and they are both excited. On their way to\r\n the new place, they get into a car accident. He dies, she loses the \r\nbaby, and her legs are crushed. Wheelchair-bound now, she moves home to \r\nlive with her gloomy father (David Andrews). Jessabelle's mother died \r\nwhen Jessabelle was a baby; she and her father barely speak to one \r\nanother when she returns home. Expressionless, he leads her through the \r\nhouse to the dead mother's old bedroom, untouched since her death. \r\nJessabelle will sleep there since it's on the ground floor. The\r\n house is the scariest element of the film; it is a masterpiece of a set\r\n (Jade Healy was production designer). Red brick on the outside, with \r\ntiny squinting windows, it is yawningly empty on the inside, rooms \r\ncareening off into the distance, unfurnished except for random gigantic \r\ncupboards and cabinets shoved up against the walls. It feels like a \r\nplace where time has stopped. Seen mainly from Jessabelle's point of \r\nview, rolling through it in her wheelchair, the house is disorienting. \r\nYou never get the real lay of the land. You never see the upstairs.  Jessabelle\r\n keeps seeing and hearing strange things in the house. She glimpses a \r\nstrange girl with long black hair (reminiscent of the girl from \"The \r\nRing\") through the sheer curtains hanging around her mother's bed. \r\n(Despite how frightening the vision was, Jessabelle keeps closing those \r\ncurtains every night, making one think she enjoys being \r\nterrified). In a box hidden under the bed, Jessabelle finds VHS tapes \r\ncontaining video-taped messages made for her by her mother (Joelle \r\nCarter) in the last months before giving birth. The \r\nmother, at first, is filled with joy and anticipation, bringing tears of\r\n happiness to Jessabelle's eyes as she watches. Soon, though, a dark \r\nforeboding mood intrudes (Joelle Carter is rivetingly uneasy in the \r\nrole, leaning forward to whisper to the camera, \"Don't tell Daddy about \r\nthe Tarot cards.\") Advertisement In a fit of fury, \r\nJessabelle's dad throws out the video tapes and also tosses her \r\nwheelchair into the lake. Things go south from there. Jessabelle finds \r\nan unlikely ally in a high school boyfriend named Preston (Mark Webber),\r\n who is married and yet seems to have a ton of free time to drive \r\nJessabelle around as she investigates her past. Their journey leads them\r\n deep into the bayou, and involves Voodoo altars, strange graveyards, \r\nand an old white-haired woman with giant terrified eyes moaning a Creole\r\n chant. Some of this ends up having undeniable racist implications, the\r\n black characters presented as completely \"Other,\" with no humanity \r\nwhatsoever, just frightening creatures with strange rituals emanating \r\nhostility and evil.  The scenes where \r\nJessabelle watches her mother on video tape are the best in the film. In\r\n them, there is emotional communication flowing between the past and the\r\n present, longings and needs on both sides, giving a unique look at the \r\nmother-daughter bond: the mother needs to tell her story, and maybe warn\r\n her daughter about something, and the daughter needs to feel close to \r\nthe mother she never knew. The fact that Jessabelle starts out by losing her own baby is never mentioned; it's a huge dropped ball (one of \r\nmany in the script).  The main dropped \r\nball in the film has to do with Jessabelle's injured legs. She \r\ncannot move without assistance, and is completely at the mercy of \r\nwhatever horrible thing comes at her. But \"Jessabelle\" totally lacks a \r\nvisceral sense of how vulnerable she is; how trapped she is, physically.\r\n One needs only to think of the bone-chilling scenes in \"Wait Until \r\nDark,\" where blind Audrey Hepburn walks through her apartment, unaware \r\nthat three thugs loom all around her in the shadows. As capable as she \r\nis as a character, she cannot see what we in the audience can see. Our \r\nhelplessness is activated ferociously by her predicament, filling \"Wait \r\nUntil Dark\" with a sense of pure dread. It seems a no-brainer that \r\n\"Jessabelle\", with its heroine in a wheelchair, should work on that same\r\n level, but it doesn't. Like so much else in the film, her physical \r\ndisability just sits there onscreen, but unexamined beyond a facile \r\nsurface level. Advertisement Sarah Snook is good in \r\nthe title role, especially in the solo scenes where she watches her \r\nmother's video-taped messages. There's a ton of bad vibes from her \r\ngrumpy silent Daddy, there's a lot of mystery in who her beautiful \r\nmother really was, the secrets she hid. At one point, Jessabelle finds a\r\n couple of steamy romance novels her mother hid in a drawer, and \r\nJessabelle says, delighted, and almost embarrassed, \u00a0\"Oh my word. Thank \r\nyou, Mama.\" These are the true Southern-fried guts of \"Jessabelle.\" \r\nThese moments are specific and lived-in. If only it hadn't decided to be\r\n a horror film instead.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Finding Fela", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Documentarian Alex Gibney's \"Finding Fela,\" about the legendary African pop star and political activist, feels like a rough draft for a very good movie.\u00a0 Parts of it are stirring because the subject matter is inherently noble.\u00a0Fela Ransome Kuti, who died in 1997 at age 58, was multi-disciplinary songwriter, singer, bandleader and activist who invented Afrobeat music, hooked up with the Black Panther Party during a U.S. tour, then went home and mocked the dictatorial Nigerian government throughout the 1970s. He also formed a commune, Kalakuta Republic, that he declared a sovereign nation; started a nightclub called the Afro-Spot in the Empire Hotel in Lagos, and embraced the Yoruba faith, becoming a spiritual leader and even officiating at weddings.\u00a0 Advertisement Most of all, he was a great pop protester, working in a country where being that kind of performer required real sacrifice. Kuti was arrested or detained by police over 200 times during his career, and often the police actions were purely retaliatory harassment. Kuti's music was compositionally bold but also danceable; commentator Questlove as being in the spirit of Bob Marley's but requiring a \"more sophisticated ear.\"\u00a0 But more than that, it was a vehicle for messages of pride and defiance against Nigeria's repressive government, particularly its brutal police. Kuti teased them in songs such as \"Zombie,\" \"The Mosquito Song\" and \"Go Slow\" (about the horrendous traffic jams in the Nigerian capital of Lagos, which cops tried to speed up by beating any drivers who didn't move quickly enough). The movie\u00a0never attempts even a speculative answer to the question of why a notoriously thin-skinned and violent government allowed Kuti to mock them openly over so many years. And yet if you don't know every detail of the story, this vagueness works in the movie's favor; you worry that just around the next bend lurks the moment when the government finally gets fed up.\u00a0 A life this packed with so much incident can't help but be fascinating, especially when some of the incidents are personally harrowing. Kuti's mother, the pioneering feminist and anti-colonialist activist\u00a0Funmilayo Ransome Kuti, was thrown out of a window when police raided her son's compound, then lapsed into a coma and died. Kuti also faced internal resentment and rebellion after his cousin emptied his bank account and his once-loyal bandmembers became increasingly disgruntled at having to play without being paid.\u00a0 Was there enough existing film footage and still photography to fill out a feature-length documentary about Kuti without bringing in extensive backstage footage of \"Fela!\", the Broadway music about him? Given the film's two-hour running time, which wouldn't be so onerous if the pacing weren't so lumpy, I have to wonder. Gibney and his crew jump between a relatively straightforward documentary with talking heads and archival imagery and a backstage, \"making-of\" type documentary, about artists (including the show's director-choreographer Bill T. Jones) analyzing Kuti's motivations and mindset, the better to guide a show's musicians and dancers.\u00a0 Advertisement The film barely settles into one groove before it's unceremoniously torn out of it. Both documentaries are good (though the straightforward one, about the man himself, is rawer and more urgent than the backstage one, which too often feels like an extended ad for the still-touring musical); but you do often feel as though you're watching different takes on the same subject glommed together. As a portrait of a great artist and activist, \"Finding Fela\" is worth a look, but it's Gibney's weakest work as a filmmaker.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Ingrid Goes West", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "There's a popular website devoted entirely to the \"downfalls\" of Instagram celebrities, those camera-ready people (mostly women) who transform their lives into a \"brand.\" The Instagram feeds feature \"personal\" photos of laughing babies, vaguely bearded husbands, shabby-chic lofts, chunky dinnerware, each post tagged with affiliate product links. Everyone knows\u00a0these feeds are fake, or at least \"curated\" within an inch of their lives, but the most successful ones have millions of followers. Every so often, one of these celebs \"falls.\" The veil lifts, revealing the flawed human underneath. Schadenfreude is ugly but inevitable. \"Ingrid Goes West,\" the new black comedy directed by Matt Spicer, starring Aubrey Plaza, is so insightful about this sub-culture, about its appeal but also about the traps of believing so fully in what is fictional. The film is very smart, most of all because it resists the urge to devolve into a sentimental redemption narrative. This is a daring comedy with a very sharp bite. Advertisement When we first meet Ingrid (Aubrey Plaza), she is in the process of crashing a wedding and spraying Mace in the bride's face as retaliation for not being invited. A little bit later we learn that the two women weren't even friends. Ingrid was just obsessed with this woman's Instagram feed, and felt they had a personal connection. A short time in a psych ward follows. Upon Ingrid's release, she falls back into the old pattern. Life is not worth living without an object of desire. A woman's magazine profiles an Instagram celeb named \"Taylor Sloane,\" (Elizabeth Olsen) and Ingrid leaps upon the new obsession with the savvy of a professional stalker. Taylor's Instagram feed (which you can check out here)\u00a0is a hypnotic onslaught of sunlight, happiness, laughter. Ingrid, using the money she inherited from her recently deceased mother, moves to California to seek out her new best friend. Ingrid sets herself up in Taylor's neighborhood, renting an apartment from an aspiring screenwriter and Batman obsessive named Dan (O'Shea Jackson Jr.). He looks at this awkward girl - who pays her rent in cash, who has a dark cloud over her head - with humor, curiosity, and a healthy dose of skepticism. Maybe it takes an obsessive to recognize a kindred spirit obsessive. Because \"Taylor\" posts her whole life on Instagram, Ingrid knows the cafes and stores she frequents. Finally, she kidnaps Taylor's famous dog so that she can then \"return\" it in person. Taylor and her husband Ezra (of course that's his name) are so grateful they invite Ingrid to stay for dinner. Ezra, complete with manbun, is played by Wyatt Russell. Almost immediately, you can sense that all is not so perfect in the world of Taylor Sloane (Olsen and Russell are terrific), but Ingrid is blind to the signs. While you may know where all of this is going, \"Ingrid Goes West\" doesn't take the well-trod path. Much of the laughter comes from a queasy recognition of online behavior, stuff we all do. (There's a huge difference, for example, between typing \"Hahahahaha\" in response to a post, and \"Heh heh.\" Which self do you want to present? Personality becomes completely performative.) The film calls to mind \"Single White Female\", of course, but it has more in common with dark portraits of obsessive anti-social personalities, like \"The King of Comedy,\" \"Purple\u00a0Noon,\" \"Observe and Report,\" \"Young Adult,\" \"Welcome to Me.\" Can someone like Ingrid be \"cured\"? How do you develop a personality out of a void? If the whole world is a mirror, then how do you develop a self in the first place? One thinks of Alain Delon as Tom Ripley in \"Purple\u00a0Noon,\" kissing his own reflection rapturously, while dressed in his friend's dapper clothes. That's not narcissism, not exactly. It's a dangerous merging, an attempt at emotional co-option. \"Ingrid Goes West\" could afford to go further into that realm - there are a couple of moments where it wavers in conviction - but, in general, it keeps its eye on the ball wonderfully well. Advertisement Plaza is, at times, unnervingly blank. She is a compulsive co-opter. She doesn't yearn for meaning. All that exists for her are her needs. You watch in horror as she makes one embarrassing choice after another. Plaza's understanding of the character's inner abyss is extraordinary, as is her understanding that the character couldn't stop even if she wanted to. Ingrid is an empty and damaged woman, grasping desperately for the totally inane and phony surfaces\u00a0filling up Taylor's Instagram feed. Other actors might plead for our sympathy, or try to \"shade in\" some of the gaps with armchair psychology. Plaza doesn't. She lets the blankness stay put, lets it fill up with echoes and reflections. Plaza's real gift is in making Ingrid both hilarious and tragic. She doesn't pull her punches. It's part performance, part social commentary. O'Shea Jackson, Jr., (who played his father Ice Cube, beautifully, in \"Straight Outta Compton\") brings a whiff of the real world outside Ingrid's bell jar, even as he gets roped into some of her schemes, willingly or unwillingly. Ingrid is sometimes like a petulant child, angry that her friend won't play the make-believe games she wants to play. Jackson brings an improvisational energy to his scenes, a sense that he is always thinking more than he is saying. Ingrid takes advantage of him. He lets some of it slide, he calls her on some of it. Ingrid is too caught up in her fantasy to perceive that there's some old-fashioned romantic chemistry with this guy. \"Ingrid Goes West\" is a biting expose on How We Live Now: sitting on our phones, rote scrolling through someone else's online life, clicking \"Hearts\" without even taking a moment to absorb the image. The film lampoons stuff that didn't even exist 10 years ago but has now become such a part of our everyday lives that no one takes a second to consider the potential negative effects. If everything is public, then where is the Self? Is turning yourself into a \"brand\" really a good idea? If you don't take a picture of it and - crucially - share it with the world, did it really happen? Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Riot Club", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Spoiled rich people have been awful for centuries and our\r\ntheatre, literature, and film has been reminding us of this fact with\r\nregularity. To this pile of moralizing fiction about the soulless elite, we can\r\nnow add Lone Scherfig\u2019s \u201cThe Riot Club,\u201d adapted from the play \u201cPosh\u201d by Laura\r\nWade by the author herself. The play caused something of a stir when it\r\npremiered in 2010, in no small part because it was deemed to be a commentary on\r\nthe actual Bullingdon Club, an all-male \u201cBriternity\u201d if you will, of men\r\nbehaving badly. The immediacy of real-time, horrendously escalating behavior on\r\na stage does not make the transition smoothly to film, partially because we\u2019ve\r\nseen stories like this so often before but also because of tonal and pacing\r\nmistakes made by Scherfig and a cast of overly similar young men who start to\r\nblur together. It\u2019s also a film with a muddled message in that it places these raucous,\r\nintellectual, smart people on a pedestal and then wags a finger at the audience\r\nfor ever liking 90% of them. It\u2019s a film that seems to have no further point\r\nthan to remind us that some powerful jerks were once powerful jerk kids. Point\r\ntaken, but it\u2019s not cinematically satisfying. Advertisement Max Irons (son of Jeremy) gets the most memorable role as\r\nMilo Richards, a first-year student at Oxford University who is quickly drawn\r\nto two people: Lauren (Holliday Grainger), a beautiful fellow first-year who\r\nforms a relationship with Milo despite her lower social status economically and\r\nformer Westminster schoolmate Hugo (Sam Reid), who proposes that Milo join an\r\nelite group to which he belongs: The Riot Club. The rules of The Riot Club are\r\nsimple. It must always have ten members. The ten members must come from\r\ncertain, elite schools like Westminster. And the ten members must drink\r\nheartily from the cup of life. In the prologue, in which we see the formation\r\nof The Riot Club, a toast is made that we shall \u201cEat till we are sick at the full table of life and never fade from\r\nglory.\u201d For a long first act, Scherfig and Wade depict this motto in\r\nvivid color. The initiation of Milo and fellow new member Alistair (Sam\r\nClaflin) plays like a hundred fraternity pledge weeks we\u2019ve seen in American\r\ncinema down to the vandalism of their rooms and the forcing them to ingest\r\nbodily fluids. They run around Oxford saying annoying things like \u201ctotally f**king legend\u201d and we wait for\r\nthe inevitable turn. Will these bad boys get their comeuppance and realize the\r\nerror of their ways? Milo is clearly set up as the only one with a conscience\r\nwhile Alistair is his opposite, a young man whose brother was a legendary Riot\r\nClub member and he has big, gross shoes to fill.  It all builds to the actual adaptation of the play, which\r\ncomes about 45 minutes in and takes place in a dinner club that the boys have\r\nrented for the night as a party to celebrate Milo and Alistair\u2019s induction.\r\nThey take over a back room, and one can tell that the seeds of resentment,\r\njealousy, and classism that Wade has planted are about to be watered. The\r\nintroductory act and this centerpiece of the film feel like different projects.\r\nThe characters, the class issues, the narrative purpose is more distinct.\r\nStill, the message of the film remains muddled even as vile words give way to\r\ndespicable actions. We are meant to like Milo basically because he has a\r\ngirlfriend and hesitates, only slightly, in the face of committing heinous\r\nactivity. It\u2019s a thinness of character that feels about as superficial as any\r\nof the Riot Club member\u2019s choices. And too much of the behavior, especially in\r\nthe first hour, is portrayed as glamourous. These are beautiful people doing\r\noutrageous things and the turn toward real darkness in the final act feels\r\nmanipulative more than organic. Advertisement To be fair, there are some strong performance here by the\r\ntwo gentlemen given real characters (Irons & Claflin\u2026the rest truly blur\r\ntogether, making one of their victims' assertions that he couldn\u2019t tell them\r\napart a bit of self-criticism on the film) and Grainger. And Scherfig gives a\r\nfew sequences the right degree of righteous indignation at the behavior of boys\r\nwho know they can pay their way out of any immorality. It\u2019s just not enough to\r\njustify the journey into the immorality that resides in the educational history\r\nof many of the world\u2019s power players. Yes, powerful young jerks become powerful adult jerks and there\u2019s little justice\r\nto it all.

{"Title": "A War", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "This Danish movie opens with a scene of high tension that\r\nsoon situates the viewer exactly where he or she would never want to be. In\r\nAfghanistan, a group of Danish peacekeepers is scouring a patch of barren land,\r\nwalking in a narrow, evenly-spaced line. The better not to get blown up by a\r\nland mine. Their work is methodical. The soldiers are in constant contact with\r\ntheir base, and its commanders and intel officers are providing calm, expert\r\nguidance. But of course something bad is going to happen. And something bad\r\ndoes happen, and the consequences weigh heavily on the commanding officer,\r\nClaus Pedersen. Out of a sense of guilt, and more overtly to make up for the\r\nabsence of a shell-shocked soldier whom he\u2019s decided to put on camp patrol,\r\nPedersen begins accompanying his troops on their away-from-base rounds. He\r\ndoesn\u2019t know it, but he\u2019s setting himself up for a fall.  Advertisement I\u2019m being\r\ndeliberately vague about the plot points of this gut-churning movie, written\r\nand directed by Tobias Lindholm, it\u2019s because I truly believe, beyond any kind\r\nof \u201cspoiler-alert\u201d preemptive service-journalism second-guessing, that this is\r\na movie best experienced more or less cold. Pedersen, beautifully portrayed by\r\nPilou Asb\u00e6k, is a good man\u2014a large portion of the movie\u2019s first half crosscuts\r\nbetween him and his wife and kids in Denmark, and his devotion and care is\r\nalmost palpable\u2014and arguably a good soldier. But what does it actually mean to\r\nbe a \u201cgood soldier?\u201d \u201cA War\u201d asks this question in an understated but\r\nunambiguous way. The movie could take this ever-pertinent quote from Ernest\r\nHemingway as its motto: \u201cNever think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how\r\njustified, is not a crime.\u201d Once Pedersen and his troops are lured, in a\r\ncompletely appalling way, into a brutal ambush, Pedersen takes action that ends\r\nup curtailing his tour of duty, calling him back to Denmark to answer for a war\r\ncrime, weighing his own conscience against the dry dictates of a defense\r\nattorney who flatly tells him, \u201cI\u2019m here to create acquittals, not deal with\r\nmoral or ethical questions.\u201d This is a\r\nmovie where it\u2019s extremely helpful to\r\npay attention, especially during the ambush scene, because Lindholm places the\r\nviewer in a noisy, confusing predicament along with the soldiers. It\u2019s\r\ndifficult to keep track of what\u2019s going on, let alone make an assessment of\r\nwhat you yourself would do in Pedersen\u2019s place. And again, the consequences of\r\nwhat Pedersen DOES do are nothing less than appalling. Which side are you on?\r\nWhich side is the movie on? Asb\u00e6k\u00a0is such an appealing actor, and the smirks\r\nand pouts of the movie\u2019s prosecuting magistrate Lisbeth Danning, played by Charlotte Munck, are\r\nportrayed as on the petulant side, but even here the movie maintains an even\r\nhand: her arguments are cogent, sane, humanitarian, not wrong. The quiet\r\nauthority Lindholm brings to the portrayal of all the aspects of the story\u2014the\r\nsoldiering, the camaraderie, the domestic travails of Pedersen\u2019s wife as she\r\nmanages the mutating behaviors of their three young children, the bland yet\r\nimposing officiousness of the military tribunal\u2014is exemplary, and puts me in\r\nmind of the definite but unimposing style of the Iranian filmmaker Asghar\r\nFarhadi, who deals with not entirely similar but nonetheless extremely fraught\r\nmoral conundrums. \u201cA War,\u201d as tough to watch as it can be, is an extremely\r\nrewarding and disquieting experience.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "And the Oscar goes to ... Nick Kroll as Professor Poopypants.  That's not going to happen, of course. Films as knowingly goofy and childish as \"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie,\" a DreamWorks feature about two friends who create an unlikely superhero and battle a super-villain to save their school, don't get nominated for Oscars, even for Best Animated Feature. They don't give out little gold men for vocal performances as supporting characters in cartoons, either, because there is no such category. Nevertheless, Kroll, a comedian and actor best known for \"The Kroll Show\" and \"The League,\" deserves above-and-beyond recognition for his irrepressibly silly voice as the movie's pint-sized, German-accented mad scientist bad guy, who poses as an elementary school science teacher and has flying wings of white hair poking out from his acorn-shaped head and wants to neutralize every living person's sense of humor so that they will never again laugh at his name, Professor Pee-Pee Diarrheastein Poopypants, Esq.  Advertisement Remember when you were a kid and the funniest of your friends would do a specific silly voice that made you laugh no matter what they said, and once he figured out what an easy mark you were, he'd do the voice all the time, sometimes he did it right before you took a sip of orange juice to make you do a spit take? That's the kind of voice Kroll gives this character: an orange juice spit-take voice. He's a little bit Mel Brooks' The 2000-Year Old Man, a little bit Dr. Scott from \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" with a touch of Peter Sellers as \"Dr. Strangelove,\" but there's an inner-directed exasperation to the performance that centers it and sometimes makes Poopypants comic book-deep, like a villain in a good Tim Burton movie. (Remember those?)  Yes, Poopypants is evil, and so fiendish and relentless that best buddies George (Kevin Hart) and Harold (Thomas Middleditch) and their principal-turned-superhero, Captain Underpants (Ed Helms), who was created with a hypnosis ring taken from a cereal box, seem incapable of stopping him and his super-weapon, a walking, growling toilet that spits emerald goo derived from the school's discarded lunchroom food. (The toilet was originally a science fair entry made by the resident power-worshiping nerd, Jordan Peele's Melvin; long story.) But you can also see why Poopypants is in a terrible mood 24/7. The way Kroll savors every syllable of his alternately peevish, self-pitying and nonsensical dialogue\u2014aided mightily by the animators, who've given the character a fireplug body and a waddling walk\u2014transforms the ridiculous into the sublime. The moment where George solemnly tells Poopypants that his problem is that he can't laugh at himself, and Poopypants whines, \"Oh, is that really what my problem is, Oprah?\" made me laugh so hard I thought my son was going to ask me to leave.  The rest of the film is nearly as good. It suffers from a rushed, jumbled quality, and it displays a lot of tics that have become tiresome because DreamWorks has been doing them over and over again for 15+ years, ever since they worked in the original \"Shrek\": these include frenetic action scenes, up-to-the-minute slang that will be dated six months from now, and the use of workhorse pop songs, including Aretha Franklin's \"Respect,\" to pump up humor and sentiment even though the scene might've played fine without them. (It's like watching a kid put extra sugar on sugary cereal.)  Advertisement But there's also a lot to like here. I haven't been this pleasantly surprised by a big-budget, little-kid focused animated film since the original \"Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs.\" It's straight-up ridiculous from start to finish, from the razor-toothed mini-toilets that creep across the screen at the end to its many throwaway sight gags, like the bit where the boys dig through a drawer where the principal has stashed their confiscated toys and withdraw a squirt rifle twice the size of the drawer. It's at its best when it's cutting loose and delivering slapstick and fantasy sequences of escalating absurdity. When George and Harold are separated by Captain Underpants' humorless alter-ego, Mr. Krupp, they imagine themselves separated by a desolate rocky plain, then a sea of stars, then a galaxy.  Aside from a few earnest, brief paeans to the power of friendship and the necessity of recognizing others' loneliness, there's not much that seems intended to turn kids into better people, and that's a big reason why so many of them are going to like it. The movie reminded me a little bit of my daughter's comment after visiting the various Disney World theme parks at age eight: \"My favorite one is Magic Kingdom, because that's the only one where you don't have to learn anything.\"  Director and co-writer David Soren and screenwriter Nicholas Stoller  clearly adore the source material, a series of paperback tall-tales  aimed at ten-year old children's giggle-centers. They've preserved Pilkey's exuberant drawing style as well as his understanding of what sort of humor is guaranteed to make young kids laugh until their sides hurt: clever, talkative hustlers getting out of jams they created themselves; snooty or hateful characters getting their comeuppance; anything having to do with poop, toilets, underwear, yucky lunchroom food, and adults falling down and being humiliated and chastising hordes of laughing children for not respecting their dignity; and funny voices. Always funny voices. Orange juice spit-take funny. Parents and children who have read Pilkey's books together may  appreciate the sheer don't-give-a-hoot nerve that the filmmakers have  brought to a project that's a thousand kilometers away from being  reputable. They've approached this compendium of elemental slapstick and  unabashed childishness with the reverence that the Coen brothers  brought to \"No Country for Old Men.\" The 3-D animation is designed and  executed in an unrealistic manner, paying loving attention to light and  shadow but tossing the laws of physics out of the nearest classroom  window. And whenever you start to feel suffocated by the bright color  and excess of detail, the film will cut to a sequence in a different  style: black-and-white line drawing, mid-century, UPA-style animation,  sock puppetry.  Advertisement There's even a flip book action-scene interlude. As any true \"Captain  Underpants\" fan will tell you, the flip book interludes in Pilkey's books are  the best parts. Here, the filmmakers haven't just included one, they've gone to the trouble of reproducing the  inevitable moment where the flippers get so excited that they tear the  page. This happened to me more than once while reading the books to my  son when he was small, years ago. It's not often that a movie puts a spotlight on a mundane ritual in your own life that you never realized was profound and says, \"You probably forgot about this, but I want you to remember it and savor it, because it meant something.\" It happened while watching this ridiculous cartoon. They recaptured it, all of it, down to  the ecstatic pause while the parent fetches Scotch tape to repair a torn page. I  never expected an adaptation of \"Captain Underpants\" to deliver a  version of the madeleine moment in Marcel Proust's \"\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu.\" But here we are.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "In This Corner of the World", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "With two world leaders discussing the size of their nuclear arsenals and their willingness to use them, it\u2019s poignantly appropriate that Sunao Katabuchi\u2019s \u201cIn This Corner of the World\u201d is opening in stateside theaters after its successful Japanese run. A dramatic animated film set in Hiroshima and Kure, mostly in 1944 & 1945, Katabuchi\u2019s adaptation of the award-winning manga by Fumiyo Kouno is an elegant reminder that we can never forget what life during wartime does to the human soul. Late in the film, our protagonist says, \u201cI wanted to die a daydreamer.\u201d That\u2019s what war does: it takes away one\u2019s ability to dream by making reality too oppressive for the light of imagination to find its way through the darkness.  Advertisement \u201cIn This Corner of the World\u201d is the story of Suzu Urano, an artistic, kind, supportive young woman who moves to Kure, a small town just outside Hiroshima. Using thousands of photographs of the era, Katabuchi artistically and yet realistically recreates the area in the \u201830s and \u201840s. The film is constantly reminding us where we are in history with on-screen dates, almost like a journal, and, of course, everyone knows what happened in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. It\u2019s that knowledge of history that brings an understated poignancy to the first half of \u201cIn This Corner of the World,\u201d as it really just captures countryside life in Japan before the world changed forever.  While most of the film takes place in 1944 and 1945, we do get to see life in Hiroshima in the \u201830s, and it\u2019s a lovingly detailed recreation combined with a sense of the beauty of the natural world clearly inspired by Katabuchi\u2019s work with Hiyao Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli (Katabuchi was assistant director on \u201cKiki\u2019s Delivery Service,\u201d and worked at Ghibli on other projects as well). In a structure that\u2019s sometimes too episodic, we really watch a coming-of-age story as Suzu develops her personality and lives everyday life in pre-WWII Japan. So, there are a lot of scenes that play out like anecdotes a woman would tell her grandchildren about how she learned to cook, make a kimono, draw a fish, etc. It can sometimes lead to an erratic rhythm that verges on being too slow. This kind of episodic storytelling works masterfully in a manga, as stories and imagery are more structurally self-contained, but film requires a different flow. However, patience in the first half of \u201cIn This Corner of the World\u201d is rewarded in the second. As air raids and rations become a part of daily life in Hiroshima, Suzu\u2019s story becomes more heartwrenching and tragic, and yet Katabuchi never loses the visual beauty of the film. There\u2019s a striking centerpiece sequence in which Suzu is out during an attack, and Katabuchi transposes shots of explosions across the sky with painterly images, turning the bombs falling into brush strokes on a canvas as blue as sky. It works with Suzu\u2019s artistic talent, but it\u2019s also almost a meta-commentary on the film itself, blending art and history.  Advertisement From there, \u201cIn This Corner of the World\u201d becomes more and more harrowing. Rations get more limited, the area is bombed more often, and Suzu faces horrific tragedy. Suzu experiences an injury at one point that I won\u2019t spoil, but that almost becomes a commentary on Japan since World War II, moving on but forever altered, never quite the same as it was before. Ultimately, \u201cIn This Corner of the World\u201d is a stark reminder of what wartime does to those ethereal elements of humanity that we truly need to survive: dreaming, art, love, etc. We are all lessened by war. Even if \u201cIn This Corner of the World\u201d ends on a note that imagination and hope can continue, it would serve our world leaders, two in particular right now, to watch this before allowing the horror of war to repeat itself.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Easy Money: Hard to Kill", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "I'll begin this review with a consumer alert: this crime movie is a sequel. That its title contains a colon might have already tipped you off to that, e.g., that \"Easy Money\" is the name of the franchise and \"Hard To Kill\" is the latest installment. Or it could, on the other hand, have given you the impression that someone's done a mashup of the 1983 Rodney Dangerfield/Joe Pesci vehicle and the 1990 Steven Seagal/Kelly Le Brock thing.  \"Easy Money: Hard To Kill\" is neither, rather, the title is a trying-too-hard-and-yet-not-enough Americanized version of the\r\nSwedish \"Snabba Cash II\" which itself actually sounds catchier and clearly signals \"sequel.\" In fact, \"Snabba Cash II\" is not just a sequel but the second part of a trilogy. Anyway, the ultimate point is, if you DON'T go into this movie knowing it's a sequel, you're gonna have at least 20 minutes of rough sledding ahead of you, because there's no recap from the first movie. The viewer is put into the middle of three cross-cut scenarios of men in trouble. There's not-quite hardened criminal JW (Joel Kinnaman) doing time and in a cell with a onetime enemy, the wheelchair-bound Mrado (Dragomir Mrsic); would-be drug smuggler Jorge (Matias Verela), who's bad luck for his would-be partners and himself; and hapless Mahmoud (Fares Fares), who's in so deep to gangster Radovan (Dejan Cukic) that he's resorting to the pathetic crime of stealing his sister's wedding money. It seems inevitable that the paths of these fellows will cross\u2014and if you know the first movie, you know their paths have crossed before. But if you don't, you just have to go with it.\r\n Advertisement Like its prequel and already-produced final chapter, this movie is adapted from best-selling crime novels by Jens Lapidus, and director Babak Najafi handles the material with a gritty confidence. Sweden has never looked more bleak (at least not in a color film) as the characters navigate the non-melting pot of Swedish criminality, where Spanish, Arabic, Serbian and other immigrants vie for power and position with native men in power of both the criminal and business categories. On release from prison, JW cheerfully goes to meet the \"business partner\" for whom he's developed software, only to find the guy's ripped him off without blinking. \"Class is something you're born with,\" the upper-class rat sneers at JW, touching off the latter's hopeless spiral back into the criminal world, a robbery scheme with Mrado. A drug-deal burn leaves Jorge with a human responsibility he's not prepared for (don't worry, it's not an adorable little orphan girl, although she is female), while Mahmoud's debt means he has to do a favor for Radovan\u2014a favor that\r\ninvolves killing a former friend.  Eventually the movie succumbs to the usual contemporary crime-picture commonplaces: a deus ex machina that's kind of ridiculous in spite of how meticulously it's set up, a lot of \"look who I've become\" chest-thumping from too many characters, and an ending that weighs itself down with forced what-might-have-been poignancy for one of its main players. Which is too bad, because the hierarchies among thieves shown at work here are actually something relatively new in the genre, and worth exploring. Which isn't to say the shootouts are bad. But given the substance that was already inherent in the material, it seems wasteful for the filmmakers to discard it for the sake of one more guns-cocked standoff.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Ticket", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "There\u2019s a story told several times in Ido Fluk\u2019s \u201cThe Ticket.\u201d It opens the film and is repeated by its protagonist, James (Dan Stevens, riding a hot streak with FX\u2019s \u201cLegion\u201d and the smash hit remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d). It goes roughly like this: A man prays every day to win the lottery. He does this for years. Eventually, an angel goes to God and says, \u201cCan\u2019t we just let him win finally?\u201d And God says, \u201cI\u2019d love to. But he\u2019s never bought a ticket.\u201d At one point, James\u2019 friend Bob (Oliver Platt) tells James that he doesn\u2019t get the story he\u2019s been telling over and over again. I\u2019m not quite sure the movie gets the story it\u2019s trying to tell either. It\u2019s just one of those films that one is constantly wishing would coalesce into something tangible and concrete, but it keeps slipping through your fingers. Like the parable that James arguably doesn\u2019t understand, one wants \u201cThe Ticket\u201d to strike harder, take more chances, and simply be more memorable. Advertisement James was blind yesterday. He is not today. He wakes up in the opening scenes of the films to a bright, vibrant world that he can see. His doctors have little explanation as to why his pituitary gland has shrunk, allowing him to see again. His supportive wife Sam (Malin Akerman) is understandably floored by the revelation\u2014although Fluk and co-writer Sharon Mashihi don\u2019t do nearly enough to ground or define the relationship. I understand the desire to open the film on the day that James can see\u2014it allows for the camera to replicate his blurry vision coming into focus\u2014but the movie relies a lot on telling us about James & Sam\u2019s relationship instead of showing us their foundation before James\u2019 new gift creates cracks in it. The first crack comes when James notices that his son Jonah (Skylar Gaertner) has a black eye. It\u2019s the kind of thing he notes that Sam wouldn\u2019t have told him about and he never would have known about a bully situation at his school. The implication, more than once, is that Sam has been controlling James, and now she can\u2019t be in charge as much as she used to be. The second crack comes when James notices that co-worker Jessica (Kerry Bish\u00e9) is stunningly beautiful. And Jessica starts to grow attracted to James as well when the newly confident young man becomes a shark at the office. James works for a company that buys real estate at cheap prices from people in a position where they need to sell. And he develops a rather insidious way to bilk people of their property that\u2019s basically a con job in which James gives speeches about financial advice that attempt to push them toward selling. So, in relatively short order, James becomes superficial. Or does he? Was James always kind of an asshole and sight only makes that part of his personality easier to feed? Again, this is an interesting angle into the story of \u201cThe Ticket\u201d that\u2019s left relatively unexplored, partially because of the structure of the piece, but more because it feels like Fluk & Mashihi are just too hesitant to really make James a villain. If you\u2019re going to tell the story of a man who tears his seemingly-good life apart when he\u2019s given a gift from God, we need to feel the joy of the gift and the pain of the fall. This is essentially an Icarus tale without the feeling of flight or the sensation of burning. Advertisement So why bother at all? Well, Dan Stevens is gonna be something big. It was kind of clear on \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d and \u201cThe Guest,\u201d but his work in \u201cLegion\u201d and this mark another step up the career ladder. He imbues James with layers of back-story and subtext that keep the film working in spite of its narrative thinness. Like his character\u2019s ability to sell a bad deal, Stevens is one of those actors who is so charismatic that they can sell a bad movie. One only wishes the rest of the film knew what to do with him.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Naz & Maalik", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Naz & Maalik,\" a first feature by writer/director Jay Dockendorf, shows 24 hours in the life of Naz (Kerwin Johnson Jr., making his acting debut) and Maalik (Curtiss Cook Jr.), Bed-Stuy high school kids. They save up for their \"college funds\" by hustling cheap items on the sidewalk. The night before, the boys took their friendship into a romantic and sexual realm. They are devout Muslims with traditional parents (Naz having the additional paranoia of a snooping Morality Police 14-year-old sister), and so their situation is precarious. \"Coming out\" isn't even an option they discuss. Instead, they talk about everything else.  Advertisement As they circulate their neighborhood, a gleaming car tails them, driven by FBI agent Sarah Mickell (Annie Grier). The FBI agent's identity and agenda is revealed in the first 10 minutes of the film when the point-of-view shifts away from the boys and into her car, a choice that deflates the tension (and it happens every time she's onscreen). The outrageous unfairness of her harassment of them (they are innocent, except for sneaking around having a forbidden romance, and why is that her business?) loops into the larger theme of Muslims in New York becoming accustomed to surveillance ever since 9/11. The FBI side-plot is sloppily handled, and Sarah often comes across as emotionally unhinged. Like she needs another week of training. Maybe that was a conscious choice, but it muddies the waters. The surveillance issue is shown in a far more effective way when the boys attend their local mosque. The imam kindly welcomes the small group, saying, \"If you're here with the NYPD or the FBI, we welcome you as well.\"  The rapport between the two boys is easy, sometimes tender. They glance at one another across the subway train, and grin, keeping connection intact even when separated. Both wearing backpacks, they trudge across parks, down city sidewalks, across subway platforms, their voices coming to us from across a distance. (Cinematographer Jake Magee has a great gift for \"capturing\" what a bustling New York City sidewalk feels like, its energy, chaos, casual hum of activity. It's good street photography.) When scenes jump forward in time, so has the conversation. Their talk ranges from ethical dilemmas (Maalik whips out his Koran to check what it says), to what they would have done in the Kitty Genovese situation, to whether or not change is good or bad, to their own blossoming romance. \"Did you feel weird about last night?\" \"No. Did you?\" \"A little bit.\" \"You want to talk about it?\" They hide in alleys to kiss. There's an energy similar to William Inge's sexual melodramas of the 1950s, where \"good girls\" had to hold guys off in order to maintain their purity. Naz struggles with this more than Maalik does. Naz thinks they should stop. Maybe it's not right. His sister already calls him a \"fake Muslim,\" the worst thing anyone could ever say. In a beautiful and funny touch, when she discovers that her brother is sexually active,\u00a0she confronts him, saying, \"You can't be having sex. It's not haram. Give me 25 bucks so I won't tell Mom and Dad.\"  They're teenagers. They're nice kids. They're full of mischief. There are some sequences (one involving a live chicken) that are almost slapstick. The boys are charming (this makes them successful street hustlers). Fights explode between them, and then subside. Sometimes Johnson and Cook, new and untrained actors, are unable to navigate the emotional switch-backs along the way to a big conflict. However, they are always honest, and gentle with that honesty. When one talks, the other one listens, really listens. Their natural rhythm of conversation is the film's greatest strength.  Advertisement Some viewers may find all the walking and talking tedious, evidence of a film spinning its wheels. But these are the best sections of \"Naz & Maalik.\" Those scenes don't feel over-determined, or \"message-y\". Not everything needs to \"add up.\" We get to know them through what they talk about, who are they are in public, who they are in private. In one scene, Maalik, less self-conscious than Naz, picks up a stick, and rattles it along an iron fence, taking pleasure in the loud sound, grinning over at his boyfriend. And that's it. That's the scene. It's an eloquent fragment. There are many more like it. The editing (by Andy Hafitz) is sometimes awkward, keeping in redundancies and scenes that don't reveal anything. Just one example: Naz says to someone he's going to go get a soda. There is then a scene in a store showing him buying a soda. Then Naz is shown sitting on a stoop drinking said soda. It's three moments that should have been one, tightening the screws of the narrative, the extraneous left on the editing room floor.  In Adam Leon's 2012 \"Gimme the Loot,\" two teenagers, passionate about marking their territory as graffiti artists, traipse through different neighborhoods in New York, bantering, fighting, scheming, all with an ease that suggests their friendship and also the development of deeper feelings. It was one of the best films of 2012. \"Naz & Maalik\" has a similar structure and environment, and at times approaches the ease of \"Gimme the Loot,\" but \"Gimme the Loot\" shows just how difficult it is to make \"walking and talking\" a compelling narrative all on its own. \"Gimme the Loot\" kept it simple, immersing the characters in the hustle of a New York rarely seen on film anymore. The story gave the characters strong objectives and equally strong obstacles, allowing them to battle it out. \"Naz & Maalik,\" instead, strives for complexity. There are some very good individual sequences, and Naz and Maalik's romance is vulnerable and touching, but the film doesn't hang together. It's an important and provocative topic, but \"Naz & Maalik\" doesn't trust that it really is enough to \"just\" watch two people walk around and talk. If the characters are three-dimensional, we'll care. We'll want to watch. With \"Naz & Maalik,\" you can feel what should\u00a0have been, but isn't.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Marshall", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The 1940s legal thriller \u201cMarshall\u201d is a solid drama that gives viewers a glimpse into an alternate universe\u2014one where African-American actors could be treated as old school movie stars, in period pieces that are less concerned with giving audiences a solemn, Oscar-baiting history lesson than an entertaining story that happens to be drawn from life.\u00a0 Chadwick Boseman, Hollywood\u2019s go-to guy for playing important Black Americans, adds another icon to his gallery: NAACP attorney and future Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall, a New Yorker dispatched to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to defend a black man, Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown), who stands accused of the rape and attempted murder of a white society woman, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson). Filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (\u201cHouse Party,\u201d \u201cBoomerang\u201d) adapts a script by the father-son screenwriting team of Michael and Jacob Koskoff that jumps off from a real case. Many of the most seemingly outrageous twists are pulled from the record.  Advertisement One is a decision by the sitting judge (James Cromwell), an imperious old white man who doesn\u2019t appreciate having a cocky black New Yorker in his court, to turn Marshall into a mute bystander by declaring that only attorneys licensed to practice law in Connecticut can argue before his bench. This feels like an early checkmate intended to send Spell straight to prison: the NAACP only assigned Marshall to Bridgeport in the first place because the white majority had already made up its mind about Spell\u2019s guilt and no local lawyers would take his case.\u00a0 And so the  hero is forced to use his co-counsel, Sam Friedman (Josh Gad), an insurance lawyer who\u2019s never tried a criminal case before, as a sock puppet. He works out details of their strategy behind the scenes, then guides Friedman during jury selection and opening arguments via handwritten notes, facial reactions, and irritated sighs and grunts. From here, \u201cMarshall\u201d turns into a mismatched buddy film, of a kind that we\u2019ve never seen before. Although Boseman is 100% credible as a brilliant attorney, especially when Marshall and Friedman are trying to work around the judge\u2019s restrictions, his performance as Marshall is not an imitation; nor is it overly concerned with giving us a true psychological portrait of Thurgood Marshall the man. It\u2019s more of a classic Hollywood alpha male badass performance, in the vein of Humphrey Bogart, Paul Newman, and other 20th\u00a0century white superstars who reveled in playing\u00a0sarcastic, sexy,\u00a0domineering jerks, but were so exciting to watch\u2014whether orating, listening, smoking a cigarette in a jazz club, or just wearing an impeccably tailored suit and walking from point A to point B\u2014that you enjoyed them no matter what their characters\u00a0did. This Thurgood Marshall is so accomplished at such a young age\u2014having already argued his first U.S. Supreme Court case, and claimed Langston Hughes (Jussie Smollett) and Zora Neale Hurston (Chilli) as drinking buddies\u2014that when he arrives in Bridgeport he offhandedly orders Friedman to help him with his bags, then pokes fun at him and plays head-games with him every chance he gets. (Apparently the latter is an actual Thurgood Marshall trait: he was suspended twice from Pennsylvania\u2019s Lincoln University for pranks and hazing.) He's a bit of a bastard at times. But just when you start to worry that \u201cMarshall\u201d is about to settle into a repetitious groove, with a know-it-all hero solving a nebbish\u2019s problems, the full force of the town\u2019s majority starts to weigh on the duo, freighting their work with paranoia and fear of violence. What follows is a humbling experience for both men. \u201cMarshall\u201d is not a soup-to-nuts biography of one of the most significant figures in U.S. legal history, but a legal potboiler dependent on teamwork. It\u00a0pays attention to issues of racial, religious and gender discrimination without wavering from its main objective: giving us an entertaining film about a couple of guys who are in way over their heads. Advertisement One of the movie\u2019s most intriguing qualities is the way that it shows how power and respect vary depending on what room you\u2019re in, and who\u2019s in it with you. Marshall moseys into Bridgeport as if he\u2019s wearing an invisible cape, but in court, in the city jail, at home with his wife Buster (Keesha Sharp), and in Harlem nightspots with cultural giants, he is diminished, by his own choice or against his will; we perceive him differently, and he perceives himself differently. When Marshall is face-to-face with brawny white men who hate him on sight, the movie sharply reminds us that there are situations where college degrees aren't worth the paper they're printed on. A less frightening but equally dispiriting scene finds Marshall speaking to a black lawyer in Bridgeport who passed the bar but was denied a license to practice law because of his race. Friedman, too, seems like a different person depending on what room he\u2019s in. Marshall\u2019s swagger and awesome legal track record intimidate him, but his own younger brother and law partner idolizes and defers to him, and it\u2019s obvious that in Bridgeport\u2019s Jewish community he\u2019s a man of influence, respected in large part because he has the nerve to accept challenges that others run from. There\u2019s a marvelous moment in a synagogue men\u2019s room where a member of the congregation seems as if he\u2019s about to insult Friedman for representing an accused \u201cschwarze\u201d rapist, then slips some cash into Friedman's jacket pocket. Both Boseman and Gad do a superb job of ratcheting their characters\u2019 physical confidence up and down by degrees, depending on the circumstances. This gives the movie a richer sense of time and place than you might have expected. It also draws parallels between the experience of Jews and blacks in 1940s America that come to fruition in the movie's final summation. Hudlin and his writers pander a bit at times. Too many important moments are spelled out in dialogue even though images and performances have already explained what\u2019s at stake; some of the twists are too predictable,\u00a0and in the last third, especially, you may start to suspect that the film is playing fast and loose with the historical record to create a more superficially exciting story. (Although I knew Thurgood Marshall could write a dissenting opinion for the ages, his street-fighting skill was news to me.) Advertisement But the movie\u2019s missteps and over-reaches are all of a piece. The farther away from the courtroom we get, the more \u201cMarshall\u201d starts to feel like a detective thriller with subtle Western movie accents: the terse, one-word title positions its hero as a tough, smart sheriff trying to clean up a corrupt town. There\u2019s an almost B-movie quality to certain parts\u2014a touch of \u201cShaft\u201d\u2014and I mean that as praise. What I like most about Marshall the man and \u201cMarshall\u201d the film are their laid back confidence. It carries itself as if we\u2019ve already seen a lot of projects like this one\u2014as if there\u2019s a new funny, exciting period piece about a brilliant, two-fisted black lawyer in theaters every week, and this is just the latest. I hope the filmmakers are already working on \u201cMarshall Returns.\u201d", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Trash Fire", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Richard Bates Jr.\u2019s \u201cTrash Fire\u201d is a pitch-black relationship comedy that turns into something even more disturbing in the second half. Some of it is tonally inconsistent and the end feels rushed, but strong performances, especially from the great Fionnula Flanagan, along with Bates\u2019 unique voice keep it engaging. It\u2019s a movie that\u2019s constantly threatening to become something a bit better than it actually is, but there\u2019s enough of that promise in this creatively askew version of a story we\u2019ve heard before that the movie works. It\u2019s kind of like \u201cMeet the Parents\u201d crossed with \u201cPsycho\u201d and it\u2019s a dark, nasty piece of work in most of the ways it should be. Advertisement Adrian Grenier (\u201cEntourage\u201d) plays Owen, a guy who\u2019s, well, kind of an asshole. We meet him fighting with his girlfriend Isabel (the excellent Angela Trimbur) and soon learn of his various personality deficiencies. He\u2019s an aggressive guy, one who can\u2019t be bothered to remember the jobs of his wife\u2019s friends and drinks to excess. In fact, the film\u2019s biggest flaw is that Owen is such a loathsome prick in these early scenes that one wonders what the hell Isabel saw in him in the first place. Although there\u2019s something interesting in the idea that these two are in the final days of a relationship\u2014those moments in which sex is more sporadic than fighting and the clock is merely ticking to the end. Their impending break-up is interrupted by a pregnancy, which Owen handles with typical dickery but eventually comes to see as the start of a new chapter in his life. He will be a better person to be a good father, and to start on that road he must first reconnect with the family he left behind. When Owen was a teenager, his parents were killed in a horrible house fire. Owen blamed himself for the fire, which also horribly scarred his sister Pearl (AnnaLynne McCord). Pearl and Owen were sent to live with their cruel grandmother Violet (Fionnula Flanagan), but Owen took off one day, leaving Pearl stuck in the house of horrors. Now, Isabel insists that she meet Violet and that Owen reconnect with his sister before they start a family of their own. Her intentions may be good, but some families shouldn\u2019t reconnect. Almost instantly, we can sense that there\u2019s way more going on with Violet & Pearl than Owen has conveyed to his girlfriend. The first time we see Pearl, she\u2019s sneaking around in the middle of the night, spying on Isabel through a peephole while she touches herself (the first direct nod to \u201cPsycho,\u201d which is followed by an even-more-direct shower scene later in the film). Something is a bit off with Pearl. And Violet is just a vicious, cruel woman, the kind who openly calls Isabel a whore when she learns she\u2019s with child. Violet is one of those women who hides her sociopathology behind the veil of religion. In Bates\u2019 most daring moment, he even has her masturbating to televangelism. As soon as we meet her, especially as played by the perfectly acid-tongued Flanagan, we know she\u2019s going to be bad news for Isabel. Advertisement Bates has a twisted, pitch-black sense of humor, often reflected best in his dialogue: \u201cI used to take his name in vain too. Then he killed my parents and set me on fire.\u201d To enhance a relatively straightforward first half, Bates and his cinematographer Shane Daly can sometimes get a little flashy with fisheye lenses and dialogue delivered straight to camera. Not all of the visual choices work. And the film builds tension only to run headfirst to its conclusion. I\u2019m all for WTF endings, but the air comes out of this one a bit too fast. Having said that, there\u2019s a twisted voice at play here that I like, and Trimbur and Flanagan give particularly strong performances. In fact, Grenier almost takes a back seat in the second half as Trimbur\u2019s quest to, at first, get some respect from her future grandmother-in-law, drives the narrative. She\u2019s got great comic timing, and matches up well in scenes with Flanagan. \u201cTrash Fire\u201d is a strange little slice of what I used to call \u201cPicket Fences Horror\u201d\u2014the idea that there\u2019s more going on behind those perfect white fences than middle America would like you to believe.

{"Title": "Mr. Turner", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Filmmaker Mike Leigh's biography of the landscape painter J.M.W. Turner is what critics call \"austere\"\u2014which means it's slow and grim and deliberately hard to love\u2014yet it's fascinating, and the performances and photography are outstanding. Leigh, the writer and director of such classics as \"Naked\" and \"Secrets and Lies,\" usually tells stories set in the present day, often of a more urban character. His notable exceptions, such as the outstanding \"Topsy-Turvy\" and this movie, require him to work in a somewhat different vein, and be more attentive to composition and atmosphere and period-accurate psychology; but it's just as compelling a mode, because Leigh's emotionally reserved nature comes through more strongly, and seems attuned to his buttoned-up, often repressed characters, who shove negative thoughts way down inside themselves, practically to the bottoms of their feet, and soldier on.\u00a0 Advertisement The film's title character is one of many such characters in \"Mr. Turner.\" Timothy Spall plays the Cockney painter, who imbued often outwardly unremarkable panoramas with an intensely spiritual feeling that's intriguingly hard to match up with the man we see before us onscreen. Often described as the \"painter of light,\" Turner was part of the Romantic school of painters, whose work eventually led, on visual art's slowly unfolding timeline, to the Impressionists. The film is appropriately fascinated by light and color and what it takes to create or re-create them. Turner, who's a \u00a0stiff when it comes to talking about everything else in life, can go on forever about light. He listens closely when his\u00a0Scottish polymath cousin Mary Somerville (Lesley Manville) schools him on the magnetic properties of violet, or when his father\u00a0(Paul Jesson), who travels the world buying his son paint, warns him, \"Ultramarine's going up a guinea a bladder.\"\u00a0 I say Turner's a \"stiff\" when he's not talking about art, but that's an understatement. When not painting or discussing painting, much of his behavior is socially inept, insensitive, often unfathomably inappropriate, to the point where you wonder if he has some sort of condition. He seems not to be in control of his impulses, much more so than more functional people around him. At times he seems\u2014to put it in a modern way\u2014to be not quite wired right. The combination of his awe-inspiring talent and the acclaim it brought him explains, at least partly, why almost nobody calls him on his strangeness or piggishness. To be fair, though, the 1829\u00a0death of his father, an event that occurs early in this movie, might have spurred a lot of the behavior that Leigh explores; depression tends to amplify one's personality as surely as intoxicants might. We see Turner going to a brothel and asking to draw a prostitute, then weeping inconsolably, then having his way with his housekeeper (whose expression indicates that this is not an uncommon occurrence, and is in fact one aspect of their complicated relationship). He is a shattered man. We also see Turner interacting with his colleagues, many of them landscape painters nearly as famous, at a gallery show, where he walks around inspecting the layout of the gallery, telling a painter friend that a woman's leg in a panorama could use a bit of highlight, and then startling everyone by painting a single daub of red in the middle of an intricately finished landscape painting\u2014an act that another painter interprets as a declaration of war on whatever cliches the show embodies.\u00a0It's in this latter sequence that \"Mr. Turner\" most distinguishes itself from other films about art and artists, indeed from most screen biographies.\u00a0 Advertisement Like Leigh's \"Topsy-Turvy,\" which showed the world of Gilbert and Sullivan almost exclusively through their eyes, and the eyes of their performers and collaborators, \"Mr. Turner\" understands creative people on every conceivable level, and translates that understanding with a deftness rarely seen outside of astute documentaries about creative people. To watch it is to feel as though you're a part of its world, talking shop with the painters, experiencing tiny fluctuations in received wisdom and sudden changes of artistic direction that can only be sensed by professionals who are plugged into their art form, and completely in command of their talents. That the performances are excellent will come as no surprise to Leigh fans. Spall, who's had a remarkably varied career, adds another fine portrait to his own actor's gallery with Turner, a character who's impossible to fully fathom (as if you'd want to!) and even more impossible to approve of. He can be high-handed, brusque, oblivious. But there's something immensely sad about him, and you can sense it most strongly during moments like the one pictured at the top of this page, when he's seen from a distance, from head to toe, moving through the sorts of landscapes that he himself might paint. These images, photographed by Leigh's regular cinematographer Dick Pope, express the essence of a phrase used by Manville, \"the interconnectedness of all things.\"", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "NOW: In the Wings on a World Stage", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Being interviewed about his process of creating the hunchbacked Richard III for the 2012 Bridge Project production he took around the world, Kevin Spacey talked a lot about the physicality of the character, the psychology, and then said that, ultimately, \"I just let the play take me.\" Unfortunately, \"NOW: In the Wings on a World Stage,\" the Jeremy Whelehan-directed documentary about the \"Richard III\" production, doesn't do the same thing. The play is not allowed to take us anywhere; the documentary is more interested in the experience of the actors and what it was like for them to work with Kevin Spacey and tour the world. \"Istanbul is so exotic,\" is one reaction from a young actor, and that's about as good as the commentary gets. Advertisement The disjointed, flighty structure, including backstage \"confessionals,\" makes the documentary feel like an extended episode of MTV's \"Road Rules,\" with only occasionally tantalizing glimpses of the actual production. Scenes are not allowed to play out in full, and there is often voiceover placed over the scenes, where actors reminisce about what it was like working on the scene in question. The end result is confusing and frustrating. Al Pacino's \"Looking For Richard\" grappled with the great challenge of the play itself, and that monster of a lead role. \"NOW: In the Wings of a World Stage\" feels self-congratulatory in comparison, a cast sharing its fun photo album of a year-long vacation in \"exotic\" locations. The Bridge Project was the brainchild of Kevin Spacey and Sam Mendes, a partnership between BAM, the Old Vic, and Mendes' production company Neal Street, devoted to bringing productions of classic plays to audiences around the world, using a cast of both American and English actors. Due to union rules, this sort of cross-national-pollination in casting is rare, and Mendes said, \"The idea behind The Bridge Project was born out of a simple desire: a wish for artists, collaborators, and audiences on both sides of the Atlantic to experience one another's work, talent, and artistry in the theater.\" The Bridge Project started off with two 2009 productions, Shakespeare's \"Winter's Tale\" and Chekhov's \"The Cherry Orchard\". Two more productions followed, and in 2012, the Bridge Project's final production was \"Richard III,\" starring Kevin Spacey in the lead role. They toured the world with \"Richard III,\" taking it to Turkey, Italy, China, Greece, etc. \"NOW\" introduces us to the cast. There are American actors, some of whom have never done Shakespeare before. There are British actors, some damn-near legendary, like Gemma Jones. The American actors discuss being intimidated by the British actors and their facility with language, and part of the Bridge Project's mission was to try to blend the two traditions. We are shown some of the rehearsal process, although not enough of it. Instead, we are subjected to long scenes watching the cast surf down sand dunes in Dubai and talk about what a great experience it was for them as a group. It feels like sitting at a table with a bunch of people who were all just on vacation together and want to show you 500 photos of the amazing time they just had. Advertisement There is one long section in the documentary where Annabel Scholey, who played Anne, discusses the challenge of Act 1, Scene 2, where the scheming Richard seduces Anne over the coffin bearing the body of King Henry VI. At the beginning of the scene, Anne rails at Richard, calling him a \"foul devil,\" and by the end of it, she is engaged to be married to him. She leaves the stage, and Richard smirks, \"Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?/Was ever woman in this humour won?\" The journey one must take during that scene is a daunting challenge for any actress. Scholey talks in-depth about her approach and how she and Spacey cracked it in rehearsal. But again, frustratingly, we are never allowed to see the end result play out in full. We get only glimpses. The documentary seems to think we are more interested in seeing the cast take pictures of each other on the Great Wall of China and talking about how much they miss their families back home than doing the actual show. Richard III is one of the largest lead roles Shakespeare ever wrote. The character is rarely off-stage. There is the physical challenge of creating the man's disabilities. Actors have ruined their backs, sometimes permanently, while doing a long run of \"Richard III.\" Antony Sher, in his wonderful book \"Year of the King,\" which details his process creating the role for the 1984 Royal Shakespeare Company production, talked about how he worked with a physical therapist in preparation for the run. Spacey's comments on the character of Richard III are somewhat interesting, especially the bit about how once Richard puts the crown on his head, everything changes. Up until then, he has been a delightful villain, commiserating with the audience, cackling in glee (Richard is quite funny). Once he actually gets what he wants\u2014the crown\u2014the only thing left to do is protect his power at all costs. There is a great moment in the play which everyone referred to as \"The Qaddafi Entrance,\" where Spacey, wearing dark sunglasses, a rakish crown, and a military uniform emblazoned with medals and wide epaulets, staggers onstage surrounded by an entourage of bodyguards, with martial drum-rolls accompanying the entrance. It looked thrilling. It would have been nice to see more of it.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "7 Chinese Brothers", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Jason Schwartzman's performance as a surly slacker and Olympia Dukakis' backup work as his grandmother are the only reasons to see \"7 Chinese Brothers,\" a comedy about a man of no ambition\u2014well, that and the image of a world largely indifferent to professionalism, honesty and decency.\u00a0 Written and directed by Bob Byington (\"RSO,\" \"Harmony and Me\"), this is is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate Schwarztman's unique brand of screen energy, if you didn't already. Starting with \"Rushmore\" and continuing through the likes of \"I Heart Huckabees,\" \"Marie Antoinette,\" \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" and four more Wes Anderson films (plus two shorts), he's somehow managed to take characters that might seem merely irritating (or far worse) on paper and find some humanity in them, so that you care what happens to them, or at least don't root for their failure.\u00a0 Advertisement \"7 Chinese Brothers\" is another performance in that vein. Schwarztman plays Larry, a witty but smug and cranky loner who gets fired from his restaurant job for stealing liquor from the bar and straight-up lying about having done it. Larry is a mess. He drinks booze out of a styrofoam cup all day, even when he's driving around town, and seems to have few friends (a nurse named major, played by\u00a0Tunde Adebimpe, doesn't count, as he's there mainly to supply the hero with pills he stole from his job at a nursing home). If he didn't care about his grandma, played by Dukakis, and dote on his bulldog, whom the director cuts to in closeup whenever he needs a guaranteed laugh, you might not believe Larry capable of caring about anyone or anything.\u00a0 But hey, what do you know: this is another one of those Manchild Finds Redemption by Entering Into an Adult Relationship with a Woman movies. The woman in question is\u00a0Lupe (Eleanore Pienta), who works at the quick lube where Larry gets a job vacuuming out cars when it becomes clear that his grandma can't afford to keep bailing him out. Little by little, the hero starts to sense some hope up ahead\u2014some kind of a future, even. Maybe. You've seen this movie before in different guises. Byington does seem to have a vision of life, though, which is more than you can say for most comedy directors working at this budget level. The world of \"7 Chinese Brothers\" is one where most people appear to have given up, or been raised not to try (in any moral or ethical sense) from the start. Byington is good at filling the frame with background detail, much of it revealed in brief cuts or moving camera shots, that confirms Larry as but one do-nothing selfish jerk in a world filled with them. Everybody's working some kind of angle here, it seems, or taking a shortcut that would appall others if they knew they were taking it (watch for the brief shot of a cook in the opening sequence scooping piles of pasta from a giant pot with his bare hands).\u00a0 All in all, this depiction of a world that's given up evokes the late, lamented HBO series \"Bored to Death,\" which starred Schwartzman as a Brooklyn-based private eye who seemed to be the only idealistic and upbeat person in a morally and spiritually exhausted universe. And there are odd moments when Larry feels as if he could be a protean version of the lazy but essentially decent concierge that Schwartzman briefly portrayed in Wes Anderson's \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" Schwartzman's intelligent eyes and deadpan reactions make him ideal for playing a cynical heel in a William Holden-Fred MacMurray vein, even as his slight frame and high tenor voice guarantee that he can't play guys as tough and fearsome as those actors often did, except as a joke. There's something genuinely special about him. That specialness goes a long way towards making this slightly-better-than-OK movie feel special, too.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "100 Bloody Acres", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "I knew nothing of \"100 Bloody Acres,\" the debut film by sibling writer-directors Colin and Cameron Cairnes, until I saw it. I certainly didn't expect it to be the best low-budget horror comedy since \"Shaun of the Dead,\" and one of the most assured first features in ages.\u00a0Set in an unspecified part of the Outback, it's one of those\u00a0\"pampered city folks terrorized in the country\" pictures, a genre that encompasses everything from \"Deliverance\" through the underrated \"Wolf Creek.\" The heroine is Sophie (Anna McGahan), a country gal passing through familiar territory in the company of two handsome young men. One is James (Oliver Ackland), a polite, responsible fellow who loves Sophie and intends to marry her. Problem is, Sophie's secretly sleeping with their traveling partner Wes (Jamie Kristian), an oddly likable jerk-stud-fratboy type who likely reminds Sophie of the sort of cocky yet alluring country tough guys she knew back in the day.\u00a0 Advertisement James has no idea that Sophie's stepping out on him, but he'll find out soon enough, and in the least desirable circumstances. When the trio's car breaks down, they cross paths with\u00a0Reg Morgan (Damon Herriman, aka Dewey Crowe on TV's \"Justified\"). Reg is half of the Morgan brothers, local businessmen who sell blood and bone-based fertilizer. The Morgans have recently purchased their first-ever set of ads on local radio; Reg is anxious to hear them play so that he can know their success is real. We meet Reg at the start of the film, pulling a car accident victim from a wreck and stashing him in the back of his panel truck along with the other roadkill he's found.\u00a0 When he chances upon the stranded trio, he's inclined to drive on until he spots Sophie. Her beauty and charm would beguile any man, but especially a man who spends most of his waking life trolling back roads for fertilize-able meat and enduring abuse from his older brother Lindsay (Angus Sampson), a bearded hulk who has some of the glowering, bitter hostility that Peter Stormare exuded in \"Fargo.\" Reg offers the trio a ride, but on the condition that Sophie sit in the cab with him while the men sit in back with all that stinking flesh. They reluctantly agree, and when they discover the dead driver under a pile of feed bags, a pity-ride turns into something darker.\u00a0 The Cairnes brothers have clearly studied the work of another sibling duo whose last name starts with \"C.\" But while the film's mix of over-the-top gore, yokel slapstick, deft wordplay and free-floating ominousness recalls \"Blood Simple\" and \"Fargo,\" \"100 Bloody Acres\" is not a Coen brothers ripoff. Nor is it a laundry list of film school homages, which is no small feat when you consider that the script evokes everything from \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"Last House on the Left\" to Akira Kurosawa's \"Stray Dog\" and \"Yojimbo,\" Rob Zombie's \"The Devil's Rejects,\" and\u00a0the exuberant exploitation pictures that Peter Jackson used to make. Advertisement Nothing about this film plays out quite as you'd expect. Reg, for instance, initially seems a standard-issue movie yokel, mangling the language and reacting to adversity with wallaby-in-the-headlights terror; but \u00a0\"100 Bloody Acres\" \u00a0eventually reveals his hidden layers. Over the course of the film Reg seems increasingly sympathetic without any special pleading by the script, and without minimizing his culpability in his brother's viciousness. Herriman's performance is thoughtful, funny and often touching: at times I felt as though I was watching a young Michael Rooker play Norman Bates as a tragic clown. All the characters are as well-drawn as Reg. They keep surprising you with artfully-revealed bits of backstory and amusing character touches, such as when Wes offers James a tab of LSD when they're in the back of the truck, with the no-big-deal affability of one hobo offering a cigarette to another while riding in a boxcar. I love the way Reg blurts out to Sophie that she's a \"city slu\u2014uh\u2014uh,\u00a0slicker!\" when they're riding together; it clues you in on the fearful misogynist attitudes that Reg learned in isolation with his scary big brother. Even better is Sophie's reaction to Reg's gaffe: rather than smack him down, she explains that the fact that she likes sex and feels comfortable having more than one boyfriend doesn't mean she's a slut, just that she's not the settle-down type. (Her attitudes would be no big deal if she were a he.) Sophie assures Reg that deep down she's still a \"country girl,\" a phrase that gets redefined away from stereotype the more time you spend in her company. Gender studies buffs are going to have a field day analyzing her choices in this movie, and not disapprovingly. James and Wes are surprising as well. On first glance they seem like a typical \"nice guy\"/\"bad boy\" pairing. But Wes is funnier and more decent than you think, and James isn't the white knight you assume he is. Maybe Sophie could be satisfied with just one guy if she could combine her two boyfriends, and create a sensitive, loyal, caring man who's also boisterous and fearless and funny and doesn't seem as though he has a fishing pole up his bum twenty four-seven. Lindsay is probably the film's most straightforward character\u2014a heavy whose violence drives much of the film's action\u2014but he isn't one-note either. There's a sadness in his eyes. Maybe he realized at some point that he's an ogre, the kind of guy who can string up a hostage by clanking chains over a meat grinder and talk to him calmly as he prepares to gut him; then maybe he decided to not think about it, as real-life ogres do. The throwaway moments\u2014such as Lindsay absentmindedly singing along with a song on the radio as he drives\u2014hint at the humanity he must have lost long ago. He just wants the family business to be secure.\u00a0 Advertisement This is a smartly written and acted and exceptionally well-directed movie.\u00a0Watch, for example, how the Cairnes brothers plant the information that Jim has brought along a ring that he intends to place on Sophie's finger, then observe what they do with the ring over the course of the picture. Watch what they do with the recurring images of lost fingers and limbs, and how the film pays them off.\u00a0Appreciate the opening credits sequence, with its wordless shots of signs advertising local businesses. \"Just Picked Figs\u2014Thanks For Your Honesty,\" one says. \"National Trust HBC and Tourists Piss Off,\" says another. These signs don't suggest smug big-city mockery, but firsthand knowledge.\u00a0 The Cairnes block their actors with the delicacy of stage directors, and use the frame line to hide and then reveal important objects and bits of information. Rather than spend the whole film jamming a wobbly close-up camera into the actors' tonsils and cutting every three seconds, they shoot them from a variety of distances and hold shots as long as they can before cutting. They aren't afraid to hang back sometimes; there are a couple of shots from the point-of-view of characters in a field beyond the farmhouse, watching other characters racing speck-like in the distance, that inspire laughs of affirmation because they feel so right. Late in the movie the filmmakers bust out some expressionistic slow-motion, lingering on a moment of realization or transformation as a character marches toward destiny, and it doesn't feel like a fussy flourish, but an epiphany.\u00a0And keep an eye out for the final shot: it's Coens-worthy. Don't see this movie if you have a weak stomach, or if you don't like movies that mix horror-movie violence and cornball humor. Don't see if it you're expecting production values beyond a couple of vehicles, a farmhouse and about twelve buckets of gore. Don't see this movie if your definition of a great or classic film is one that bowls you over with the importance of its subject or the awesome scope of its vision. Do see if it you want to be be reminded that it's possible to make a relaxed, engrossing, funny, sometimes scary movie on almost no money. And do see it if you want to be able to say you were there when a couple of unknown filmmakers embarked on a long and increasingly impressive career, because something tells me that's what we're about to see from these Cairnes fellows. They know what they're doing. The family business is secure.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Mind of Mark DeFriest", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cMark reacts.\u201d\r\nThose two words may be the best way to describe Mark Defriest, one of the most\r\ninfamous prisoners in the Florida penal system. He\u2019s a man who doesn\u2019t sit\r\nstill, even if his reactions lead to more harm than good. His story, chronicled\r\nin \u201cThe Mind of Mark Defriest\u201d is an infuriating one in that you want to shake\r\neveryone involved and ask them what the purpose of incarceration really is in\r\ntoday\u2019s society. Mark Defriest is not a dangerous man to society. He\u2019s clearly mentally\r\nill. And yet, after being sentenced to a ridiculously high four years for\r\nstealing tools that he obviously thought belonged to him after the death of his\r\nfather and before the will could be processed, Defriest has now spent 34 years\r\nbehind bars, and, at the time of the initial documentary filming, was scheduled\r\nfor parole in 2085. A series of prison escapes and serious DRs (Disciplinary\r\nReports) kept pushing his release date well past the norm, and his behavior behind\r\nbars has put him in solitary confinement for 27 of the last 34 years. Mark\r\nreacts, and the prison system reacts back. Advertisement Directed by Gabriel London, most of \u201cThe Mind of Mark\r\nDefriest\u201d consists, naturally, of Mark telling his ridiculous story, sometimes\r\nin his own words and sometimes through animated reenactments with the voices of\r\nScoot McNairy as Mark and Shea Wigham as other characters. Defriest was first\r\njailed in 1979 after the death of his father. He went to pick up some tools\r\nthat he thought belonged to him, and his mother accused him of stealing them.\r\nThe 19-year-old was given four years for the theft, but with good behavior\r\nwould likely have been out much sooner. Mark couldn\u2019t be contained behind bars.\r\nHe would craft prison items into weapons, including guns, and escaped more than\r\nonce, being re-captured every time and adding more years to his sentence.  The first act of \u201cThe Mind of Mark Defriest,\u201d in which many\r\nof Mark\u2019s more remarkable behind-bars behaviors are chronicled, is a little too\r\nhaphazard for its own good. As fun as McNairy\u2019s line readings can be, I wanted\r\nless animated memories. Defriest is a fascinating subject in his own right,\r\nand, from the very beginning, the film works best in the moments when it lets\r\nhim talk instead of its flashy, sensationalistic ones. Director Gabriel London\r\ndidn\u2019t need to skew every angle and quick cut every interview. There\u2019s so much\r\nstory here, let it tell itself instead of weighing it down in movie effects. Surprisingly and refreshingly, that\u2019s kind of what London\r\ndoes about halfway through as the animated memories let up and we spend way\r\nmore time with Defriest and the people trying to get him out of jail, including\r\nthe medical professional who once declared him \u201cmalingering\u201d (faking mental\r\nillness to get out of sentencing) but now firmly believes that Mark has serious\r\ncompetency issues. Is Mark mentally ill or is it one of his tactics? He does\r\nthings that are clearly harmful to\r\nhim and his legal situation. Isn\u2019t that a kind of mental illness in itself? As\r\nthe doctor says, \u201cPeople can be planful\r\nin the service of strange ideas.\u201d Just because Mark has the wherewithal to\r\nplan and scheme doesn\u2019t make him mentally competent. Advertisement It\u2019s also remarkably smart of London to get the warden of\r\nthe Florida State Prison involved to corroborate Mark\u2019s reports of the terrifying\r\nconditions behind bars. At different times in his incarceration, Mark was\r\ngang-raped, kept as a \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d and forced into a solitary condition in\r\nwhich he had no lights, running water, utensils, or clothes. It\u2019s hard to believe\r\nthat this is happening in the United States, and one hopes \u201cThe Mind of Mark\r\nDefriest\u201d forces further investigation into sanctioned torture happening in our\r\npenal system. \u201cThe Mind of Mark Defriest\u201d is the rare documentary that\r\ngets more and more interesting as it goes along, even ending with an update on\r\nthis still-unfolding story that just took place. As Mark\u2019s story gets less headline-grabbing\r\n(prison escapes! makeshift guns!), London allows the movie to really focus on\r\nits subject in all its fascinating complexities. How can a man known as the\r\nPrison Houdini do so many things that sabotage his own life? And is the only\r\nresponse our system can muster up for someone like Mark Defriest further\r\npunishment? Just because \u201cMark reacts,\u201d doesn\u2019t mean our legal or mental health\r\nsystems need to do the same.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "My Old Lady", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "For the first forty minutes or so, \u201cMy Old Lady,\u201d the film directorial debut of respected playwright Israel Horowitz, adapting his own play, is a \u201cno problem\u201d proposition. That is to say, because Horowitz is a respected playwright for good reason (his 1960s two-hander \u201cThe Indian Wants The Bronx\u201d is, I suspect, still a staple for acting workshops and small theater companies to this day), the writing\u2019s no problem. And because the cast is topped by Kevin Kline, Maggie Smith, and Kristen Scott-Thomas, the acting is no problem. And because the movie is set in Paris, specifically the extremely-suffused-with-conventional-Gallic-charm Marais section of the city, the views are no problem.\u00a0 Advertisement The storyline hinges on a peculiarity of French real estate sales. The movie begins with Kline\u2019s character, a put-upon aging American named Mathias (although he prefers a more casual mode of nomenclature, for reasons that become clear over time), coming into Paris full of hope and excitement: his late father, while denying his considerable fortune to his son, has willed him an apartment in Paris. Heretofore penniless and with no prospects\u2014the guy\u2019s got lots of problems\u2014his scheme to sell the apartment for a tidy sum and slough off for the rest of his days hits a snag right away: there\u2019s an old woman living in the place, and she has no intention of leaving. Indeed, she is not even required to leave. That\u2019s where the peculiarity in French real estate comes in. The apartment, which could fetch millions of Euros for Mathias, is a \u201cviager.\u201d The old woman, Mathilde (Smith), an Englishwoman long based in France, was the apartment\u2019s prior owner; the new \u201cowner\u201d can buy the place for a song, pay the prior owner a monthly fee, and inherit the place free and clear once the inhabitant dies. The desperate Mathias immediately starts calculating the likely date of Mathilde\u2019s death, while Mathilde snootily looks down her nose at failure-in-life Mathias. \u201cI\u2019m 90,\u201d she admits early on. \u201cSubtlety is not something that interests me.\u201d Turns out, according to her super-irritated live-in daughter Chloe (Scott-Thomas), she\u2019s 92, but what\u2019s a couple of years between antagonists. The antagonism, of course, has layers, and it doesn\u2019t take a lot of effort to guess that Mathilde is not just someone with whom Mathias\u2019 dad had a business arrangement. These developments turn \u201cMy Old Lady\u201d from a comedy of manners and errors into a domestic drama of not inconsiderable depth.\u00a0 Despite a certain number of plausibility-stretching plot points, particularly concerning the likely motivations of the ever-offstage dead father, and also in spite of an over-busy music score by Paul Mehling, \u201cMy Old Lady\u201d is pretty compelling viewing, mostly thanks to Kline, who gives a career-high performance here. The lithe actor has spent much of his film career being pretty bright and breezy, and here he starts from a point of glib confidence that crumbles into bluff pretty quickly, and goes to darker places than he\u2019s depicted in recent memory. It\u2019s a revelation and a pleasure. In a way, Smith has the more difficult role: her character\u2019s back story should have yielded a more hateful figure, but Mathilde can\u2019t be hateful or the whole mechanism would fall apart. On the other hand, Smith has ever seemed capable of vaulting such performing challenges in her sleep, and she does so here. The 75-year-old Horovitz does nothing to redefine cinema language with his first film, but he doesn\u2019t aim to; rather, he keeps a steady hand on his story\u2019s tiller, says what he wants to say, weakens his resolve and delivers an ever-so-slightly pat denouement, and gets out.

{"Title": "Tumbledown", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The opening sequence of \"Tumbledown,\" drenched in the golden light of memory, complete with bittersweet voiceover, places the film in Nicholas-Sparks-Land. The music is sad, Rebecca Hall sits at a laptop, typing the words she says in voiceover. Director Sean Mewshaw and cinematographer Seamus Tierney pour it on. \"Tumbledown\" is\u00a0far more complex than the opening would suggest; the U-Turn in tone is drastic. Considering the fact that \"Tumbledown\" is about, in many ways, how to construct a narrative, and who\u00a0gets to shape a narrative, the opening can be seen as a self-aware joke. You may think you know what you are about to see when you watch that opening, but you would be wrong. It's great to be wrong. Advertisement \"Tumbledown\" (with script by Mewshaw and his wife Desiree Van Til) is about a young grieving widow named Hannah (Rebecca Hall). Her husband, Hunter Miles, had recorded only one album in a makeshift studio behind their house in Maine. That album became a cult classic, and then he died suddenly, after falling into a ravine. Hunter Miles\u00a0is imagined along the lines of Nick Drake, Elliott Smith, Jeff Buckley\u2014men who died too soon, whose songs continue to influence. (The soundtrack for \"Tumbledown\" is filled with what is meant to be Hunter's songs, composed and sang by musician Damien Jurado, with a high eerie voice reminiscent of Bon Iver's.) Hunter Miles'\u00a0fans make pilgrimages to Maine to visit his grave. The wall of the ravine where Hunter fell is covered in scratched messages from fans. They hunger for more from him but have to be satisfied with what they got, only 12 songs.\u00a0 Hannah is furious at the speculation that Hunter\u00a0was a member of the 27 Club, that he committed suicide. She is working on a biography of him, and refuses to speak to the press who hound her for more information about him. Her attitude is reminiscent of Ted Hughes' poem \"The Dogs Are Eating Your Mother,\" addressed to the two children he had with wife Sylvia Plath (who, of course, committed suicide in 1963). Hughes describes the ravenous Plath scholars as dogs ripping apart her corpse, and warns his children: \"Protect her And they will tear you down As if you were more her. They will find you every bit As succulent as she is.\" Hannah, as protector, has experienced what Hughes described. But then Andrew McDonnell (Jason Sudeikis) arrives. He's a pop culture studies professor, working on a book about young dead rock stars and Hunter Miles\u00a0will be the most important chapter. Andrew wants access to Hunter's rough drafts, journals, letters, but Hannah won't return his calls. To Hannah, Andrew is just one of the dogs eating the corpse of her husband. Andrew travels up to Maine from New York City to track her down. They get off to a rocky start, but when she reads one of McDonell's chapter drafts she responds to his sensitive prose. Reluctantly, she agrees to a partnership and McDonnell moves into the house.\u00a0 Advertisement The script is a bit wordy, with some of the lines sounding like words on the page, but overall, the dialogue is smart and funny. There are a couple of different tones established, with varying degrees of success. There's a City-Mouse/Country-Mouse narrative. Hannah, who grew up in Maine, rolls her eyes at city-boy Andrew's car that can't maneuver in a snowstorm. Andrew is unconsciously snobby, expressing surprise when he learns that the flannel-wearing Hannah has a PhD. There's also the Hate at First Sight device, Andrew and Hannah's first conversation consisting of hurling insults at one another across the table. These formulaic devices are sometimes telegraphed too clearly, making the conflicts obedient rather than organic, but the story has strength and surprise in it. The characters are all tough, verbose and self-protective. It takes time for anyone to show their cards, let alone their heart.\u00a0 There are other characters who breeze in and out. Andrew McDonnell's music-industry girlfriend (Dianna Agron) has a vested interest in her boyfriend's research. Joe Manganiello plays Hannah's local \"friend with benefits,\" who looks at Andrew, the City Mouse interloper, with open contempt. Blythe Danner and Richard Masur play Hannah's parents, worried that their daughter will spend her life making monuments to her dead husband. Griffin Dunne plays Hannah's friend in town, the only person in the movie not intimidated by her often ferocious behavior. Cinematographer Seamus Tierney captures the wintry grandeur of Maine's mountains and frozen lakes and icy woods. His work helps root \"Tumbledown\" in its landscape so much that when there are scenes in Manhattan, the city looks like a futuristic nightmare. Tierney's cinematography provides the answer to one of the ongoing questions about the life of Hunter Miles: Why did he hide out in Maine? Well, look at that scenery. That's why.\u00a0 Rebecca Hall does not play Hannah as a tear-soaked martyr. Hannah is more like an avenging angel, hovering over the fragile flame of her husband's reputation. Hall's Hannah is freckled and athletic, dressed in parkas and hiking boots, careening her pick-up truck along icy roads: a totally believable Maine girl. You can't picture Hannah in a city. She owns maybe one pair of heels, if that. She's tough, she's capable. She's also a nightmare to anyone who loves her.\u00a0 Advertisement Jason Sudeikis comes from a place of sincere decency\u00a0in the role of Andrew. It's difficult for actors to make decency\u00a0interesting. Jimmy Stewart could do it. And Sudeikis does it. Andrew doesn't behave well always, but he's not a creep. \"Tumbledown\" is not the story of a cynical urbanite who opens his heart in the country. Andrew's decency helps make\u00a0the movie. Sudeikis is touchingly open, transparent, really, throughout. He's drawn to Hannah. Because she is the widow of his idol? Because she holds the key to the secrets he wants? Or is it ... more than that? Sudeikis plays Andrew as a man struggling with all of that on a moment to moment basis. Even he is not sure what is going on. This is Sean Mewshaw's first feature. He nails the atmosphere of small-town Maine (snowshoes on the wall, random power outages, the hearty individualism of the people). The characters are believably complex. (Even Andrew's city-slicker girlfriend ends up having a blast at the \"maple syrup barn party\" when she comes to visit.) Hall and Sudeikis circle around one another warily, erupting into defensiveness, shutting each other out, then letting each other back in. There's a rhythm to it. Mewshaw helps sustain that rhythm. Once the full story unfolds, the opening sequence, so seemingly out of tune with the rest, looks like what it actually is: an effective feint. Who owns the story of Hunter Miles? Who is the best one to tell it? If a person leaves behind only 12 songs, how is the life to be analyzed? Can you make assumptions about an artist's mindset from his\u00a0lyrics? Andrew feels he knows Hunter\u00a0through his\u00a0songs; this leads him into errors, like informing Hannah's dad that Hunter probably didn't fall into that ravine (judging from his lyrics, isn't it obvious he jumped?) But is every song a form of autobiographical confession? (A.S. Byatt's novel \"Possession\" is all about the confusion of modern-day historians trying to piece together an incomplete record.) There are some slapstick sequences in \"Tumbledown,\" and familiar elements from wacky rom-coms, but the film, at its best (and it gets better and better as it goes along) is about two people struggling to control not only\u00a0Hunter's narrative, but\u00a0their own.

Sam eventually elaborates on what he means, but those two words still echo in the mind when you think back over this frustratingly fractured but still-haunting drama from the filmmaking team of Christopher Radcliff and Lauren Wolkstein. This is a primordial story filled with dreamlike symbols from humanity's past\u2014roads, forests, caves, clouds, the sun\u2014and its characters move through it in the manner of a mid-century American short story, the kind where you're not sure how literally you're supposed to take anything.  The story is told in a nonlinear, almost prismatic style, with shards of story replacing other shards, but the through-line is clear: somehow young Sam ended up in the passenger seat of a car driven by Nick (Alex Pettyfer), a rugged twentysomething with the demeanor of one of those people you read about in news stories, the kind that end with a quote from a neighbor saying, \"He seemed like a quiet young man who kept to himself. I'm shocked by what happened.\"  Advertisement It's clear from the start that this is an unnatural relationship, though we don't learn all the details until the end. Nick and Sam present themselves as brothers, and Sam unconvincingly tells everyone he meets that his name is Jeremiah, but their uneasy bond is apparent to everyone. The movie follows them as they drive across a gorgeous and eerily depopulated rural landscape, eating in restaurants and staying at a motel (run by Emily Althaus of \"Orange is the New Black\"). The co-directors and their cinematographer Todd Banhazl (\"Between Us\") shoot in a wide format that evokes sense memories of science fiction movies, action films and westerns. They often capture action from disorienting subjective angles, as in the shots of clouds scudding by as seen by the boy lying down in the backseat of Nick's car as he drives. And there are shocking flash-cuts of hideously beautiful or viscerally upsetting imagery\u2014a house in flames, blood splattering a character's face\u2014and touches that seem not-quite-surreal, and that are all the more unsettling for remaining unexplained, such as the periodic reappearance of a black cat who might be the boy's familiar.  I realize I'm being as coy and withholding in describing the story as the filmmakers are in telling it. But I don't want to get more specific here, because this is one of\u00a0those take-it-or-leave it movies where you either surrender completely to the mood and style of the filmmaking or start questioning what it's leaving out, covering up, or glossing over. I was simultaneously underwhelmed and overwhelmed by the experience of watching it. \"The Strange Ones\" is an assured movie that makes a number of big, bold choices with confidence (such as the card-shuffling editing, also by the directors, and the  decision to\u00a0break the story into neatly delineated halves that could be titled \"The Incident\" and \"The Aftermath\"). And throughout, there are little stylistic touches, like the very slow zooms into landscapes and faces and the rigidly centered compositions, that impart a horror-movie-like feeling. The problem is that the movie telegraphs the gist of what it's about to reveal pretty early on, and by the time it finally confirms your suspicions (less than 90 minutes later\u2014this is a lean film) you might look back and wish they'd spent less energy on perfecting their ambitious and nimble yet relaxed and somewhat open-ended storytelling, and more on exploring the nooks and crannies of the two main characters' psyches\u2014because in the end, despite disturbing and sometimes heartbreaking performances by both lead actors, Sam and Nick seem more like concepts or vehicles than actual people. The story is assembled like a jigsaw puzzle that one can \"solve,\" immediately or gradually, but the characters are characters, human beings, and they suffer a bit from being treated as puzzles as well\u2014their specific desires and traumas withheld from us in order to generate suspense or surprise.  Advertisement The film is worth seeing because, regardless of things that I wish had been done better or differently, it feels like the beginning of a major filmmaking career, and because Pettyfer and Freedson-Jackson are so strong. The latter gives one of the great juvenile performances of recent years. He's so unsettling, and does such an intelligent job of capturing the dislocated feeling of a child suffering traumas that few adults could endure, that the image of his face lost in miserable thought becomes nearly as horrifying as the specific acts of violence in the movie. The acting in the supporting roles is less spectacular (because what the film needs from them is a lot more modest) but ultimately more affecting, in particular Althaus as the motel manager and Gene Jones (\"No Country for Old Men\") as a senior who runs a work camp for delinquent boys. Jones and Freedson-Jackson have such a warm and mutually respectful rapport that I wouldn't mind seeing a whole film built around the two of them.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Newtown", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Gun violence is as American as apple pie and Old Glory. Kim A. Snyder's feature-length documentary \"Newtown\" establishes this right from the start by flashing images of a parade in the town's main thoroughfare (baton twirler, uniformed cops) and then bringing in audio of a 911 call from a police dispatcher asking for backup during the massacre, which claimed the lives of 20 elementary-school aged children and six teachers. No significant gun control measures have been passed since then, which makes the massacre kind of a bizarre non-watershed moment in the nation's history. The bloodshed was so sickening that no one could be unmoved by it (except the crackpots who insist that it never happened\u2014a sick twist; probably the closest the United States has gotten to Holocaust denial) but the opportunity to do something decisive and profound\u00a0passed along with the moment. Advertisement \"Newtown\" is being characterized as an apolitical documentary, just a portrait of Newtown before, during and after the shootings, but that's not entirely true. It's impossible to watch this film and feel no particular way about the killings; it's also difficult to imagine someone watching it and thinking, \"This is like a hurricane or a flood, it's just a thing that happened, nothing could have prevented it.\"\u00a0 A father starts at pictures of children who were gunned down at their school\u2014it's hard to type those words if you're a parent\u2014and says, \"This was Sunday, Dec. 9 of 2012. We were at the [Christmas] tree farm getting our tree. This was the beginning of the end of life as we knew it.\" He describes the daily ritual of seeing his older son off to school, the way his younger brother would race after the bus, then talks about how he was reluctant to remove his murdered son's clothes from a dresser drawer. \"I was so intimately connected to every little nuance of his life, but there was a significant little gap at the end of his life that I knew nothing about, and I still have this need to know what he experienced, and I guess you can only try to imagine how unbelievably difficult and challenging that is, to try to interpret what your seven-year old experienced as he was being murdered by a gunman in his first-grade classroom.\" There is a tremendous sense of loss in Newtown still; the killing frayed or severed the bonds that had built up between parents at the school (one mother says the kids were practically \"interchangeable\") and left an emotional crater at the center of daily life. \"Newtown\" captures this through the simple arrangement of interviews not about the day itself (although that comes up, inevitably) but about other days, normal days, when one parent would call another about getting their kids together to get pizza. The parents eventually had to create a spreadsheet to keep track of the details of 26 funerals.\u00a0 \"The foundation cracked,\" a priest says, \"and nobody is sure for certain how wide that crack is going to get.\" Grieving parents become gun-control activists, attending hearings and going to Washington to urge different or more effective legislation to curb the sale and distribution of firearms and ammunition, but they fail because this is the United States, a country that has made peace with the idea that the preservation of the spirit and letter of the Second Amendment to the Constitution requires thousands of gun deaths a year.  A teacher remembers the kids trying to process the bloodbath in the days following their return to school. \"They'd say, 'I miss Miss Soto,' a teacher recalls, referring to one of the teachers who was shot to death. \"What do you say to that? I would just hug them.\" \"Do I still think about it?\" says a custodian at Sandy Hook Elementary. \"I don't think there's a day or an hour that goes by that I don't think about it.\"   Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "What Happened to Monday", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Tommy Wirkola moves on from Nazi zombies (he did both of the \u201cDead Snow\u201d movies) to identical sisters in the Netflix original film \u201cWhat Happened to Monday,\u201d a showcase for Noomi Rapace\u2019s range that will suffer in comparison to the similar \u201cOrphan Black,\u201d in which the amazing Tatiana Maslany plays identical clones. The Emmy-nominated actress gives a master class with that show, offering each of her characters their own identity, personality, flaws and strengths. Rapace doesn\u2019t have nearly the same material to work with but she does the best she can with this sci-fi curiosity, a movie that starts with a relatively clever concept but then doesn\u2019t build enough on its structure. On a narrative level, it\u2019s the kind of script that feels like it never got past the concept stage, almost defiantly refusing to build on its central premise with a world that seems three-dimensional or characters who feel like more than devices. Wirkola stages a few excellent set pieces and Rapace is fantastic, but the general lack of entertainment value has to be considered disappointing given the potential of the entire piece. Advertisement In a future not that dissimilar from the one imagined in \u201cChildren of Men,\u201d human beings have exhausted our planet\u2019s resources. It\u2019s resulted in a shocking but practical government decree: families can only have one child. If a family has more than one child, the extra child will be taken by the government and cryogenically frozen until a time when we have colonized another planet or found a way to create more natural resources. The woman in charge of this program, Nicolette Cayman (Glenn Close), is the kind of ruthless leader who promises a better future while stripping families of their offspring.  When Terrence Settman (Willem Dafoe) has septuplet grandchildren, their mother dying in childbirth, he knows he\u2019s in serious trouble, but he crafts a masterful scam to keep his granddaughters alive. They will essentially take turns being Karen Settman, who eventually becomes a powerful businesswoman, but is really seven sisters working a very elaborate \u201cParent Trap.\u201d Named after days of the week, Monday, Tuesday, etc. must inform the entire sisterhood every night about every detail that happened during the day. And in one of the film\u2019s more ingeniously grotesque twists of fate, they must all look exactly the same. Think about the potential ramifications. If one sister loses a finger \u2026 And then Monday doesn\u2019t come home one night. The other six girls, who have distinct enough personalities to allow Rapace to have a little fun\u2014one is more of a bookworm than her sisters, one is more physically outgoing, etc.\u2014have to figure out what happened to Monday. It leads them into the clutches of the Child Allocation Board, and the truth about Nicollete Cayman\u2019s vision for the future. It\u2019s certainly not a bad idea for a sci-fi film, or an extended episode of \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d but screenwriters Max Botkin and Kerry Williamson needed another pass to take it beyond a very loose collection of action scenes. Most surprisingly given how \u201cDead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead\u201d played with expectations and got only increasingly more gonzo, \u201cWhat Happened to Monday\u201d is kind of boring when it comes to style. There\u2019s an awesome fight scene early on when the women are first tracked down by their enemies that features stunt work similar to Wirkola\u2019s other films, and allows Rapace to show off the physical abilities as an action star she\u2019s displayed before. But there\u2019s a shocking amount of sitting around and talking in this movie about seven sisters named after days of the week. It\u2019s almost as if the original script was more intellectual sci-fi, Wirkola pulled it as much as he could toward action, and it got stuck somewhere in the middle.  Advertisement \u201cWhat Happened to Monday\u201d is just not as fun as you\u2019d think it would be given the ridiculousness of its concept, the talent of its star, and even that one action scene. Part of the problem is the lack of a distinct villain\u2014Close hams it up in a few scenes but she\u2019s not memorable enough or given enough time\u2014which means Rapace has to flee a series of Men in Black with Guns, which just gets tiresome after a while. It\u2019s one of those Netflix films or shows that might get the job done on a boring Friday night, but that you won\u2019t remember by Monday.

{"Title": "My Cousin Rachel", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "This movie begins with a few noncommittal scenic shots of rural England and a man saying in voiceover, \u201cDid she? Didn\u2019t she? Who\u2019s to blame?\u201d Hearing this, I thought, \u201cWell, that\u2019s no \u2018Last night I dreamt I went to Manderlay again.\u2019\u201d Not fair, maybe, but \u201cMy Cousin Rachel\u201d is, like Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cRebecca,\u201d based on a novel by Daphne du Maurier, master of the moody semi-Gothic romantic thriller.  As it happens, du Maurier\u2019s novel \u201cMy Cousin Rachel\u201d has an entirely different and hookier opening line: \u201cThey used to hang men at Four Turnings in the old days.\u201d One feature of this movie, written and directed by Roger Michell, is\u2014I\u2019m assuming here\u2014a new conception of its protagonist, the novel\u2019s unreliable narrator. His name is Philip, and after wondering who\u2019s to blame, he gives a brief accounting of his life. Orphaned, brought up by an adult cousin named Ambrose, sent to school. Philip cops to not having liked books. He cops to not liking much of anything, besides hanging out with Ambrose in a dusty manse whose interior looks like the gatefold sleeve picture of a mid-70s Jethro Tull album. Ambrose runs some kind of land-based business\u2014he has a lot of workers walking around wielding scythes. It\u2019s all very pre-Victorian man-cave like, and Philip insists that\u2019s what he likes, but then, oh no, cousin Ambrose falls ill and gets sent to Italy, because that\u2019s what you did when you were sick and lived in England. From there Ambrose writes letters detailing his recovery, and the TLC he receives from yet another cousin, a young woman named Rachel. But then comes news of Ambrose\u2019s death. Philip is both heartbroken and indignant, and blames this Rachel person. To his godfather and estate lawyer, and his daughter Louise, who clearly pines for the young now-master-of-Ambrose\u2019s-estate, Philip vows revenge. Then Rachel shows up. Advertisement And she\u2019s played by Rachel Weisz, so, you know. Nevertheless, the speed with which Philip transforms from would-be avenger to slack jawed google-eyed \u201clet me give you all my mother\u2019s jewelry\u201d dope is kind of astonishing. First he insists that she stay in the mansion, which he and Louise have managed to clean up so it\u2019s more Jane Austen than Jethro Tull. Then he gives her access to his accounts. Eventually, he decides to turn over all his worldly goods to her on his 25th birthday. In return, he wants \u2026 well, he\u2019s not quite so indelicate as to articulate it.  This is an arguably juicy narrative, especially when intercepted letters and other items start to cast suspicions on the seemingly pure-and-true Rachel, and after Philip contracts a nasty virus that could in fact be related to the herbal \u201ctisanes\u201d that Rachel concocts and practically force-feeds the fellow. But \u201cMy Cousin Rachel\u201d is an impossibly turgid film. From the moment it opens, it\u2019s constantly indicating menace and heightened emotion, but never doing anything to genuinely evoke it. Rael Jones\u2019 music is the main culprit here, but the film\u2019s most blatant disaster is Sam Claflin\u2019s performance as Philip. From the first minute Claflin presents the character as a kind of period bro, albeit one whose default mode of dealing with his environment is a sneering entitled truculence.\u00a0 The character\u2019s ingenuousness is meant as a kind of virtue, at least I think it is, but Claflin\u2019s sneering, furniture-smashing, and banality make Philip impossible to care about. As for Weisz, she\u2019s not given much to do besides be tender and/or affronted; the plot, such as it\u2019s been adapted for this film, hinges on her character being kind of unknowable, so we\u2019re left with a good-looking cipher, through no actual fault of Weisz\u2019s. And Michell\u2019s direction is both overstated and incoherent. Plot threads are inexplicably left to hang, only to be picked up at a later point when the viewer has pretty much been obliged to move past them. Focus tricks in individual shots, and unwarranted camera movements meant to create a sense of unease merely elicit the response \u201cwhat\u2019s THAT about?\u201d Michell has made watchable films in the past\u2014you may like \u201cNotting Hill\u201d; I was more partial to \u201cVenus\u201d\u2014but this literally looks like a picture made by someone who\u2019s forgotten how to direct.  Incidentally, the du Maurier novel was made into a picture years ago, with Olivia de Havilland in the title role and a young Richard Burton as Philip. Big shoes to fill, but I honestly don\u2019t even think that was an issue (the movie is not well-remembered today except by devoted fans of its stars) in the creation of this movie. One of the problems with this \u201cMy Cousin Rachel\u201d is that it\u2019s hard to come up with any issue or reason relative to its creation, I\u2019m afraid.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The November Man", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"The November Man\" is a strange and frustrating movie. It seems to want to be a James Bond or Jason Bourne picture: the kind of film in which car chases are tracked by satellites and drones, assassins cut down bushels of henchmen while barely batting an eye, and good and bad guys alike seem to just magically appear, a la Christopher Nolan superheroes, wherever the plot needs to them to be. At the same time, it wants to be a\u00a0John Le Carre-type espionage drama, set in a version of reality and mixing allusions\u00a0to\u00a0real-world geopolitical traumas (including Russian-Chechnyan conflict and CIA black ops) into the heroes' derring-do. The movie's snarling, R-rated-tough-guy worldview\u2014which includes graphic shootings, knifings, rapes, and sexist insults\u2014sits uncomfortably with the movie's desire to be a late-summer thrill ride. \"The November Man\" wants to be taken seriously, except when it doesn't. This creates viewer whiplash. The movie is confused and often untrustworthy. Advertisement The movie opens with a brief flash-forward. Government assassin\u00a0Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) blasts his trainee, David Mason (Luke Bracey), for disobeying orders in an operation that was supposed to thwart an assassination but ended up causing a child's death. Five years later, David is ordered to kill a\u00a0former Russian double-agent named Natalia (played by Mediha Musilovic)\u00a0who broke into the office of the\u00a0soon-to-be-elected president, Arkady Federov (Lazar Ristovski). Why? Without giving too much away, let's just say that the CIA is up to no good, as is so often the case in movies and life, and that a self-interested power broker inside the agency wants to prevent the information that Natalia stole from getting out and\u00a0embarrassing\u00a0the agency. Unfortunately for whoever did this, Devereaux has a deep bond with Natalia. He embarks on a mission of revenge that also requires him to\u00a0find a young woman named Alice Fournier (Olga Kurylenko) and prevent her from being killed\u00a0by his former student David or by Russian agents (including Amila Terzimehic's\u00a0Alexa, a leggy mute whose stare could burn holes in concrete). Meanwhile, David tries to thwart or kill his old mentor\u2014as the film itself jokes, he has daddy issues\u2014while grappling with the suspicion that his lethal proficiency and loyalty are being abused for selfish purposes, in an off-the-books CIA operation whose outlines he can't discern. Nobody in the cast makes much of an impression except for the old pro character actors and Brosnan, who is perfectly cast as Devereaux. Handsome and lean but grey and haggard, he has twenty years' worth of experience playing these sorts of men, starting with his version of James Bond, a colder, more self-loathing version of Ian Fleming's super spy than fans were used to seeing. \"I might as well ask you if all those vodka martinis ever silence the screams of all the men you've killed, or if you find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women for all the dead ones you failed to protect,\" another agent asked in \"Goldeneye.\"\u00a0 \"The November Man\" is based on the seventh in a long-running series of novels about Devereaux by Bill Granger, but there are times when it seems to be a direct answer to that question, which Brosnan's Bond answered with a knowing, faintly sad look. Devereaux is a highly functioning alcoholic who downs hard liquor the way other people drink water, and he admits to Alice that he has no life to speak of; he's just a warm-blooded cipher living as far off the grid as he can, and trying to keep his personal relationships secret from the global espionage community so that they cannot be used against him. At one point Devereaux, who apparently quit the CIA out of slow-building revulsion, lectures his former pupil on the need for moral clarity, telling him that you can be a man or a killer of men, \"but not both, because one will eventually extinguish the other.\"\u00a0 Advertisement This is all intriguingly regretful and angry stuff. It's not at all the sort of thing you normally encounter in the sorts of films where people beat each other senseless in basements and make spectacular kill-shots while sailing through the air unloading handguns. Donaldson, who directed Brosnan in \"Dante's Peak,\" is an unheralded master of down-and-dirty violence. The film's most brutal moments have a sting that has largely disappeared from Hollywood movies. When people get shot or stabbed or hit in the face with a blunt object, the audience gasps as if it happened in front of them on the street. That sort of visceral intensity isn't easy to conjure for viewers who think they've seen everything. But it's all in the service of an ultimately retrograde, cartoonishly macho vision of lone heroes doing what lone heroes do, so it's hard to accept as anything other than a means of dressing up Bourne-style mayhem with a world weariness that the Bourne franchise did with more conviction. Movies about assassins and gunfighters and other killers who come out of retirement for one last mission often try and fail to solve this insincerity problem. The characters pay lip service to the notion that being a paid killer rots the soul\u2014which is surely true\u2014but nobody who bought a ticket wants to see them practice nonviolent resistance and play \"Kumbaya\" on a ukelele. \"The November Man\" knows this on some level, but it still genuflects in the direction of LeCarre, like a sneaky delinquent impersonating a scholar. \u00a0It doesn't actually regret violence, but there are moments when it seems to regret having to pretend to regret it. An old-school, Schwarzenegger-style bloodbath would've been more honest. \"The November Man\" also fails to earn the power it summons whenever it shows us scenes of people threatened with torture, or bloodily maimed, or raped. At first you may think it's a movie set in a sexist world, but soon enough you figure out that the film itself is sexist. When David's superior officer (Bill Smitrovich) barks slurs at a female subordinate, at one point addressing her as \"tits,\" the moments are treated as tension breaking laugh lines. A sexually abused character seeks revenge by trying to seduce her abuser, and Donaldson's camera caresses the lines of her cocktail dress, adopting the POV of her target's lustful guards. A sweet innocent becomes collateral damage and suffers mightily; the film takes the character's fear and physical pain seriously for a scene or two, whereupon that character vanishes from the story and is never seen or heard from again. The movie fails to develop the most important people in Devereaux's life as characters, even obliquely, until the movie needs to terrorize or kill them to jack up suspense and sympathy. Despite occasional humanizing moments, including a shot which confirms that\u00a0Kurylenko can actually play piano, the movie\u00a0treats everyone as cannon fodder. Sam Peckinpah, this ain't.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cA house with a death in it can never again be bought or sold by the living. It can only be borrowed by the ghosts who have stayed behind.\u201d Shortly after that killer opening line, our protagonist Lily Saylor (Ruth Wilson) drops another bombshell when she reveals that she\u2019ll be dead within a year. Osgood Perkins\u2019 \u201cI Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House\u201d is an atmospheric take on the haunted house flick that works more with dread and the looming specter of death than the traditional tropes that often define the genre. Sure, there are a couple of moments to make you gasp, but Perkins is working in a more circular, dreamlike manner. The whole film takes place in the house at the end of Teacup Road in Braintree, Massachusetts, and this house is haunted. This is something of which we can be certain. It is one of the few things in this film of which we can be certain. Advertisement From the very beginning of his sophomore film (his even-better \u201cFebruary\u201d aka \u201cThe Blackcoat\u2019s Daughter\u201d has lingered in distribution purgatory but should be released next year), Perkins is playing with perspective and atmosphere. For example, when we meet Lily, it is on her first day in the house. She says, \u201cThe pretty thing you are looking at is me. Of this I am sure. My name is Lily Saylor. I am a hospice nurse. Three days ago I turned 28 years old. I will never be 29 years old.\u201d We hear this in voiceover, although Wilson\u2019s eyes break the fourth wall, staring directly at camera. The omniscient narration that knows its own death, the character who draws us in with her eyes before she\u2019s even spoken\u2014Perkins is playing games with structure and filmmaking. He\u2019s confronting us directly and beginning a sort of circular logic to the film, one in which the dead, the living, and the about-to-die intersect, and we are drawn into the center of this intersection. Lily has come to this home to take care of an elderly woman named Iris Blum. In a very unspecified time period (although phones are rotary, televisions have rabbit ears, and we see VHS tapes for video and cassette tapes for audio), Lily starts freaking out about the \u201ccreepy\u201d old house on night one. She\u2019s essentially alone in that Iris doesn\u2019t speak much, spending her time in bed. We only have one real scene of character exposition early, when Lily is on the phone and we learn that she was almost married once. From then, we flash forward almost a year. And, of course, Perkins knows we\u2019ll remember that narration about Lily not making her next birthday. It's hard to explain the circular nature of Perkins\u2019 ambitious narrative. Blum is a famous writer, and her most famous book is called The Lady in the Walls, featuring a lead character named Polly. From the beginning, Iris calls Lily by the name Polly, and the frightened lead eventually cracks open the famous book, leading to a few scenes that are either direct adaptations of that story, flashbacks to something that happened in the house, or a dream/vision of some sort. Who knows? Perkins is never quite that literal, sometimes frustratingly so but mostly in a way that reveals his deep ambition as a storyteller. Most importantly, this is not a film to be \u201csolved.\u201d It is a mood piece made by someone constantly playing with structure, but never in a way that calls overt attention to itself. For example, when Lily starts reading The Lady in the Walls, the opening line is almost exactly the same as when she came to the house\u2014\u201cThe pretty thing you are looking at now is me.\u201d Why? Are Lily/Polly the same? And how did Iris write about them? What does that mean?  Advertisement There are traditional haunted house elements in Perkins\u2019 film like a mold problem that hints at something hidden in the walls and a use of reflection to produce a scare, but it almost feels like Perkins uses those just to keep tethered to a genre with which he wants to do something far more ambitious. What is a haunted house movie about if not death? Sure, the bad ones are often about jump scares and poor CGI, but we fear haunted houses because they remind us of mortality and force us to question that which we know about it. \u201cI Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House\u201d isn\u2019t about ghosts as much as it\u2019s about death\u2014the one coming soon for the homeowner, the one of the protagonist in her book, the one we\u2019re told is coming for its protagonist. And all of these deaths swirl around to the point that they hang in the air, creating dread. In many ways, \u201cI Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House\u201d feels more like a first film than \u201cFebruary\u201d in that its ambitions sometimes feel a bit out of reach for the final product. It\u2019s something that might have worked even better as a short film or an episode of an anthology series, as one can feel it stretching to meet a short running time. In simple terms, it feels more like a short story than a novel. However, it\u2019s a short story that I immediately started again, already getting more out of the first act than I did the first time. It\u2019s a movie that\u2019s too opaque and unusual for some viewers, but those who do give in to its unique rhythms and approach will find something often haunting and ultimately rewarding.", "Critic": "Beta"}

The absence of the word \"Superman\" leads us to expect a top-to-bottom re-imagining, and that's what the film delivers, for better and worse. This is a 2013 version of the story: dark, convoluted and violent, chock full of 9/11-styled images of collapsing skyscrapers and dust-choked disaster survivors. It's sincere but not particularly funny or sweet. The hero is a glum hunk,\u00a0defending a planet so scared of apocalyptic conspiracy that it assumes anyone who presents himself as good guy must have ulterior motives. Steel is what you need to have in your spine if you're going to be super in this world. Advertisement Directed by Zack Snyder (\"Watchmen,\" \"Sucker Punch\") and overseen by Christopher Nolan (the Dark Knight trilogy, \"Inception\"), \"Man of Steel\" largely abandons the sunny spirit and kooky humor of the Christopher Reeve-starred films, as well as Bryan Singer's homage to them, 2006's \"Superman Returns.\" It brings the character in line with the recent craze for brutal, morose tales of loners defending a world that doesn't appreciate their sacrifices. This time the big guy's suit isn't Dick Tracy red, blue and yellow; it's a muted ensemble of synthetic chain mail that's described as \"battle armor\" rather than as a uniform or costume, and Supes wears his underwear on the inside, thank you very much. Scene-for-scene, this is a first-rate example of a Hollywood fantasy released in the early 21st century: a new-car-smell summer blockbuster. It has wobbly handheld camerawork signifying \"authenticity,\" a glum color palette, skyline-shattering super-fights,\u00a0hardware whose designs crib from \"Alien,\" \"Dune\", \"Independence Day\" and Spielberg's \"War of the Worlds,\" and a detailed mythology that can plug into an expansive, Marvel-style \"universe.\"\u00a0When humor bubbles up, welcome though it is, it feels like a tonal lapse.\u00a0 \"Man of Steel\" also breaks with past \"Superman\" films in how it tells its story. The script, which is credited to David S. Goyer of the \"Blade\" films, starts with a prologue on Krypton, envisioned here as a John Carter-style land of towering hyper-structures, \"Matrix\"-looking hovercraft, and winged beasts. Superman's dad Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and mother Lara (Ayelet Zurer)are fighting two battles at once: to convince the planet's government that its environmental recklessness is causing the planet's core to melt, and to contain a rebellion led by General Zod (Michael Shannon), who's outraged that Jor-El dared to violate Krypton's biological breeding protocol and conceive a son the old-fashioned way. Zod and his followers are exiled to the Phantom Zone in ships that look mortifyingly like the hero's spacecraft in the 1970s porn spoof \"Flesh Gordon\" (the film's design is a riot of phallic and vaginal imagery, as most post-\"Alien\" sci-fi films are). Krypton explodes. Kal-El zips off to earth and is raised by Ma and Pa Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner), in idyllic prairie surroundings that call for an Aaron Copland score (though Hans Zimmer does just fine). After the New Testament timespan of 33 years, we pick up Kal-El/Clark's story in time for him to unlock the destiny that his adoptive parents kept secret. Their motives were good: they predicted the hostility he would encounter once he put on his tights \u2014 sorry, \"armor\"! \u2014 to fight Zod and prevent Earth from being flattened to make a new Krypton. (Zod's plot to create a resurrected Krypton echoes \"Superman Returns,\" though given that film's poor reception, I'm sure the filmmakers would rather nobody pointed them out.) As the adult Clark/Superman, Henry Cavill's not bad; in fact he's quite likable, and spectacularly handsome, natch. But there's no Reeve-like radiant comfort in his acting, because the character as imagined here is even more of a blank screen for our projections than most movie superheroes. Like Christopher Nolan's Batman pictures, the Goyer-scripted \"Man of Steel\" reveals key moments in the hero's development through flashbacks triggered by present-day traumas; a few parts almost seem to be unfolding along simultaneous timelines, the past and the present. This is not just defensible but appropriate, considering that so much of the story is about having to function day-to-day while carrying around the crushing weight of your own past, as well that of an extinct motherworld you never got to know. Advertisement The most striking scenes show young Superman struggling to make sense of powers he can't display, for fear of being labeled a freak or a monster. One early sequence shows young Clark zoning out during a school lesson because he's overwhelmed by the data Hoovered into his brain by his super-senses. When he looks at his classmates and teachers, he sees their bones and veins and organs through their skin, and because he hasn't mastered the art of filtering sound, he hears a cacophony of voices in his ears, like the burbling of a crowd at a ball game. There's a touch of \"The Incredibles\" in the scenes of Jonathan Kent explaining why Clark can't reveal the full extent of his specialness. Costner is superb in these moments, projecting an unforced, Old Movie-style decency that may remind fans of his performance in \"Field of Dreams.\" (It's as if Ray Kinsella, the adult son in \"Dreams\", has become the father in this one \u2014 an icon of kindness, yet sad-eyed and mysterious; \"worn down by life,\" as Ray described his own pop.) When Clark, who's passed the years on a fishing boat while rocking a \"Perfect Storm\" beard, heads north and gets his own pad, the Fortress of Solitude, he acquires a second father, his biological daddy Jor-El. Supes the elder becomes a present-tense Obi-Wan, advising and arguing with Clark (and later, Zod!). This is all good stuff \u2014 though it was done less ostentatiously in the TV series \"Smallville\" \u2014 but it's all a setup for the film's second half, which juxtaposes Clark's transformation into Superman with Zod's return to earth on a mission of vengeance and world-building. \u00a0It's here that the film loses something. It's not that what's onscreen isn't involving: for the most part it's splendidly realized, even though the muted color palette, shaky camerawork and secondhand design concepts won't win prizes for originality.\u00a0I like how the filmmakers link Superman's embrace of the destiny his adoptive father hoped he'd resist and Zod assuming the mantle of visionary warrior-leader that Jor-El denied him on Krypton.\u00a0The notion that politics is personal gets a workout. Zod isn't as amusingly effete in \"Man of Steel\" as he was in \"Superman II\", but he's not without humor, some of it inadvertent. Shannon, an expert in projecting self-defeating macho rage, makes Zod less of a straightforward evildoer than a tragically misguided antihero. There are times when his rivalry with Clark/Superman recalls the tension between Hawkeye and Magua in Michael Mann's \"The Last of the Mohicans,\" in that the villain is only a villain if you're looking at him through the eyes of the people he's steamrolling. You don't condone Zod's actions, but you understand his motivations. In his twisted way, he's trying to preserve and continue the legacy of a vanished world. Something in Cavill's beefy Boy Scout performance suggests that Superman gets this \u2014 that he understands Zod even though he knows he has to destroy him. The hero's struggle not to give into rage and pettiness when facing bullies like Zod\u2014to use his power to heal and save rather than destroy\u2014is explored with more finesse than you might expect. No, the film's most curious and unfortunate aspect\u2014its Achilles' heel, really\u2014is the way it minimizes or shuts out women. You can see this tendency in the way \"Man of Steel\" handles Lois Lane (Amy Adams). She's\u00a0portrayed as a capable reporter, more so than in previous films, but I didn't detect much chemistry between her and Clark, even when you factor in the ungodly pressure they're both under. While Clark is dealing with his demons and the world's, she's uncovering a government conspiracy to hide evidence of a buried Kryptonian spacecraft, then struggling against her Daily Planet editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) for the right to publish a story she feels is true but can't prove.\u00a0There are flirtatious moments between Lois and Clark, but they're few and far between, and I'm not convinced that the apocalyptic events surrounding the couple are the only reason.\u00a0 Advertisement This is a butch Superman film, driven by machismo.\u00a0Lois is an important character, but only for how she furthers Clark/Superman's attempts to understand himself and claim his destiny. She's less of a fully-realized human being than the kooky narcissist played by Margot Kidder in the Reeve films, or Kate Bosworth's Lois in \"Superman Returns,\" a melancholy figure defined by her ability to move on after the hero's sudden departure from earth. Adams' Lois is tough and smart, but she has no personality, only drive, and she's not as integral to the action as she seems to be on first glance. It's telling that this movie gives equal weight to the story of a distrustful general (Chris Meloni) whose relationship with Superman lets him become the stand-in for a doubting Earth, a role filled by Lois in the 1978 film. Ma Kent is endearing, but she's not as powerful a presence as the doomed Jonathan. The hero's birth mother vanishes after the prologue, her absence explained in a throwaway line that Crowe seems embarrassed to have to deliver. The uncharitable might notice than when a stupid question has to be asked, or a trivial remark made, it's often delivered by one of a handful of women in a room full of burly guys; they may also note that while every significant male figure in \"Man of Steel\" is given an option to be physically brave under horrible circumstances \u2014 even grey-haired Pa Kent and Perry White have their moments \u2014 females exist, for the most part, to be saved, or to have things explained to them. Considering that every previous \"Superman\" movie put the courtship dance between men and women at the heart of its action \u2014 particularly \"Superman: the Movie\", \"Superman II\" and \"Superman Returns\" \u2014 the fact that \"Man of Steel\" has a No Girls Allowed sensibility seems like a deliberate creative choice. It's as if the filmmakers want to reassure young male viewers accustomed to the glib swagger of \"Iron Man\" and the dire self-pity of Nolan's Batman trilogy that Superman is in the same wheelhouse. (Zod's right-hand woman Fajora-Ul, Antje Traue, is a powerful presence, but she's even more desexualized than Lois; her character's main trait is a pathological hatred of men.) Again, this is all state-of-the-art, very much in line with the way superhero movies are done now. And yet this aspect of the \"modernization\" feels retro, because it comes at the expense of an under-acknowledged part of Superman's appeal: virtually alone among big-name superheroes, he's a romantically and sexually mature man who seems to like and be comfortable around women. If you're wondering why I could say so many positive things but and only give the movie three stars, the preceding two paragraphs are your answer. Viewers who predicted that Warner Bros. and DC Comics were trying to turn Superman into The Dark Knight were right, sort of. \"Man of Steel\" is in many ways an astonishing movie, but it won't do anything to quell complaints that the big-budget superhero genre is basically adolescent, that its creative development has been arrested for decades and might not budge anytime soon.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "At Berkeley", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Frederick Wiseman's four-hour documentary\u00a0\"At Berkeley,\" about the University of California at Berkeley during the 2010 state budget crisis, makes me wish this site had a dual rating system: one for people who like a certain sort of film, another for people who find that same sort of film intolerable.\u00a0In such a scenario, the rating at the top of this page would be aimed at the first group, and there'd be a zero star rating for the second group, which wouldn't willingly get within ten miles of a movie like this.\u00a0 Advertisement Wiseman wouldn't lose a wink of sleep over that second group.\u00a0He's been making documentaries like this one for 50 years: long films\u00a0with no narration, no talking heads, no identifying titles or timestamps, indeed nothing to anchor you but the title and whatever the people onscreen are saying and doing.\u00a0 \"At Berkeley\" isn't mainly interested in summarizing the state of public universities, though in its roundabout way, it does that. \u00a0It wants to put you in the middle of a certain place and time and let you marinate in it, through quiet montages and long scenes.\u00a0Some of these long scenes let an academic, administrator or student make a point, then stay with them for another minute, or three minutes, or five. Wiseman's not just giving you a sense of the issues facing Berkeley and the people who go to Berkeley and work at Berkeley. He's giving you a sense of what it means to be at Berkeley, and to be of Berkeley\u2014what it's like to be Berkeley righteous, Berkeley caring, Berkeley clueless, Berkeley irritating. (At universities, says former U.S. Treasury Secretary turned Berkeley professor Robert Reich,\u00a0\u201cfaculty\r\nmeetings go on twice as long\" because participants \"are used to hearing themselves speak, and\r\nthey are used to seeing people nod in response.\u201d)\u00a0 At the same time, though, Wiseman gives you a sense of what Berkeley looks and feels like: the gorgeous campus with its mix of old and new buildings, some elegant, others characterless, and the way light bathes them when the sun slips behind a cloud, and the way shadow-fingers caress the quad and glide across fountains and bike racks and ivy-covered walls.\u00a0 \"High School,\" \"Hospital,\" \"Basic Training,\" \"Welfare,\" \"Canal Zone,\" \"Belfast, Maine,\" \"Domestic Violence,\" \"Boxing Gym\": each Wiseman documentary takes its title from a place. Some of his films have journalistic \"hooks,\" or news pegs\u2014for example, the second half of \"At Berkeley\" contains footage of students protesting the economic strangulation of a once-great public college, and administrators expressing sympathy while leaving maneuvering room for harsh measures\u2014but they don't draw their impact from recent events alone. They capture specific qualities that were true at a certain time and likely always will be. He's America's finest living portrait artist of institutions and their mindsets: a great pure reporter.\u00a0 The issues surrounding Berkeley\u2014the political and economic forces that caused fees to rise and staffers to get laid off, and that prompted students to worry about their futures and administrators to worry about the future of Berkeley itself\u2014these are all included, often emphatically. A veteran of the \"Free Speech\" movement decries \u201can utter lack of recognition or comprehension\u201d in today's students, which heralds their becoming \"a cynical, passive and uninformed people.\u201d An unidentified expert tells a TV news crew that public education is suffering because a handful of mostly Republican state legislators signed pledges never to raise taxes for any reason; this forced the state to balance the budget by cutting government staff and services. \"Yachts, fourth homes, billionaires, we can\u2019t raise taxes on\r\nthem,\" he says. \"But what we can do is fire\r\njanitors, gardeners, kindergarten teachers,\r\npreschool teachers, lecturers, and raise student fees.\"\u00a0These scenes can feel like cheats\u2014as if Wiseman is finding a not-so-sneaky way to do exposition without technically breaking his \"no exposition\" pledge. Advertisement For the most part, though, \u00a0\"At Berkeley\" makes it points with brief yet striking images. These seem metaphorically ripe, sometimes mysteriously so, but they don't flower in the mind until you think about several of them in succession, in context of the entire movie. \u00a0A shot of a student tightrope walker recur in your mind when you hear administrators describe their professional balancing acts. Shots of construction workers and groundskeepers and men with leaf blowers seem purely atmospheric until dire economic details creep in, and you realize they're collateral damage in budget wars. A student museum guide's speech about the Tyrannosaurus Rex, shots of young taxidermists stripping a bird carcass, and close-ups of mounted fossils could be editorial comments on Berkeley's future\u2014perhaps a prediction that robustly funded public universities will go extinct, and that the United States will follow them into history, as the inattentive miner follows his canary.\u00a0 Wiseman is also master of \"Look ma, no self-awareness\" documentaries that analyze themselves without seeming to. Sometimes he includes scenes that feel like meta-commentaries on the mindset one must adopt in order to appreciate a Wiseman film, but without seeming too clever or cute. In one such scene we see a student production of \"Our Town\" with a Stage Manager describing life in Grover's Corners: \"At Berkeley\" as drama, Wiseman as narrator. In another scene, a\u00a0professor gives a physics lecture that doubles as instructions for watching a very long film. He tells his students that there is \"nothing in the brain that perceives time,\" and that temporal units of measure are probably just mental elaborations on the pulses of brainwaves. When you perceive time, he says, you \"are relating an event...like picking up a book, or taking a drink of water\" to \"the measurement of days, the sun going across the sky\" or to \"a water clock, the measurement of drips,\" or to the pulsing of Cesium atoms. What this relating does, the professor says, is \"create time\" in the imagination while \"our brains and bodies register events.\"\u00a0 \"At Berkeley\" is an event worth creating the time to experience.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "A Long Way Down", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "There are moments of tenderness and honest human emotion buried in the frustrating \u201cA Long Way Down\u201d but one has to work far too hard and give far too much credit to the over-qualified cast to grab at them. Based\r\non a hit book by Nick Hornby (\u201cHigh Fidelity,\u201d \u201cAbout a Boy\u201d) that contained an\r\nemotional minefield maudlin enough that the film took nearly a decade to come\r\ninto existence even though the Hornby bandwagon was full in the \u201800s, \u201cA Long\r\nWay Down\u201d is a textbook case of over-direction. Characters laugh too hard; the\r\nscore by Dario Marianelli alternates between wispy guitar strumming and\r\nheartstring-pulling piano tinkling; the suicidal characters literally dance to \u201cI\r\nWill Survive\u201d at one point. You get the idea. Honest emotion falls victim to\r\npoor filmmaking again. Advertisement Martin Sharp (Pierce Brosnan) wants to kill himself on New\r\nYear\u2019s Eve. He has tumbled from the height of popularity after a sex scandal\r\nwith an underage girl destroyed his family and sees no reason to go on if he\u2019s\r\nnot famous. He climbs to the roof of the Toppers Building, a notorious suicide\r\nspot; so notorious that he runs into three other people on this frosty, fateful\r\nevening. Maureen (Toni Collette) has a severely disabled son and can\u2019t go on.\r\nJess (Imogen Poots) is heartbroken and J.J. (Aaron Paul) tells his new mates\r\nthat he has brain cancer. The four agree to delay their life-ending until\r\nValentine\u2019s Day, keeping tabs on each other over the next month-and-a-half and,\r\nof course, forming a unique bond.

To escape the attention, they jet off\r\nto a resort, frolic in the surf, grow closer, learn the importance of life, get a tan,\r\netc.  \u201cA Long Way Down\u201d is a film that\u2019s afraid of its subject\r\nmatter: suicidal depression. One never senses any actual danger or urgency in\r\nthe plight of these characters to battle their demons before they kill them, and the lack of any sense that these people might actually end their lives drains the piece of drama.\r\nTheir depression is merely a plot device. J.J. was once the frontman for a band\r\ncalled Gepetto and he laughs about one of the hackneyed lines that he wrote: \u201cI\r\ndon\u2019t mind the pain, it\u2019s the hope that kills me.\u201d Writer Jack Thorne and\r\ndirector Pascal Chaumeil present the line as a bit of humor\u00a0about a wannabe\r\ngrunge band that never was\u00a0but it\u2019s indicative of the problem with the film. The movie never\r\nminds the pain. It doesn\u2019t pay attention to it. We don\u2019t feel it. Well, most of\r\nthe time. The always-great Collette somehow finds a way to make the most\r\nmaudlin and manipulative character arc of the quartet hit most of\u00a0the right beats. The\u00a0film's greatest value is further proof that Collette makes everything she's in better. \r\n\r\nTo be fair, Poots is quite good here as well, but both actresses\r\nare weighed down by a director who didn\u2019t trust them. Jess lying on her bed\r\nsinging the BeeGees classic \u201cTragedy\u201d should be done with a wink, not with a\r\ntreacly score underneath. When the foursome realizes they\u2019ve written their\r\nnon-suicide pact on the back of Maureen\u2019s suicide note, the actors have been\r\ndirected to laugh in response in an exaggerated, overblown way. It sounds\r\npicky, I know, but \u201cA Long Way Down\u201d never registers emotionally because it is\r\nconstantly reminding you it\u2019s a movie. And it\u2019s not a very good one.

{"Title": "I Am Michael", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Not everyone wants to be part of the subculture,\" insists Michael Glatze (James Franco), in writer-director Justin Kelly's feature debut \"I Am Michael.\" (\"I Am Michael\" played at Sundance two years ago. Since then, \"King Cobra,\" Kelly's second film, has been released). Glatze is trying to convince his colleagues at the San-Francisco based gay magazine XY that the \"gay identity\" as it is understood is limiting and should be rejected. His colleagues look at him like they don't know what he's talking about, but it's just the beginning phase of the transformation of their activist friend. Michael Glatze was (and still is) a real person, and he is the subject of \"I Am Michael,\" a quiet film that attempts to understand Glatze's journey to becoming what was called in fundamentalist Christian circles an \"ex-gay.\" Glatze's story always had its fascination to those looking on as it unfolded in real time. What happened? How could this happen?\u00a0 Advertisement Michael Glatze was a highly visible member of the LGBTQ community through his work with XY, as well as the magazine he founded that focused on outreach to young people, Young Gay Americans. In July 2007, he wrote an article on WorldNet Daily announcing that he had converted to Christianity and was no longer a homosexual. He still had yearnings towards men but he worked to suppress them. \"Reparation therapy\" (as practiced by Love Wins Out and Exodus International\u2014both organizations now-defunct and debunked by their own founders) was not part of Glatze's journey, although he put himself through a similarly rigorous process of de-programming. When Glatze \"came out\" as \"ex-gay,\" he became a hero in Christian, a villain in LGBTQ circles. His transformation was hurtful to those who looked to him for leadership as well as to those who knew him personally, like his boyfriend Ben. Kelly's script is based on Benoit Denizet-Lewis' 2011 New York Times article called \"My Ex-Gay Friend\". You can see why Kelly was attracted to the story as told there. It's epic in scope.\u00a0 \"I Am Michael\" starts with a chilling scene where a clean-cut buttoned-up Michael tells a troubled teen in a counseling session that it's possible to get past one's homosexual yearnings. There is hope, in other words. Cut to an earlier time in Michael's life, where he and his boyfriend Bennett (a wonderful Zachary Quinto) dance at a rave, pop Ecstasy, have a hot threesome. They are, as a friend of mine calls them, \"A-List gays.\" A power couple. Bennett is an architect, and Michael works at XY, arguing in editorial meetings that \"being attracted to the same sex doesn't define who you are.\" Michael and Bennett travel cross-country, making a documentary about gay youth in areas far from liberal coastal hubs. \"This is Falwell Territory,\" Michael says. In one small town, Glatze witnesses a young gay kid comforting a sad friend with a prayer to Jesus on her behalf. Michael is struck by this, it challenges his assumptions that being gay and being Christian cannot co-exist. When he believes he has developed the heart condition that killed his father, his fear of death and his yearning for more from his life leads him into what can only be described as a conversion experience.\u00a0 Justin Kelly takes a non-judgmental approach to the story, especially by keeping the film solely in Michael's point of view. There's a very effective sequence where Michael, after writing the article announcing he had given up homosexuality, is bombarded with images on his laptop of all of the headlines, Christian sites crowing in triumph that Jesus really does save, gay outlets howling in outrage. Michael reads the reactions, looking freaked out and terrified at what he might have unleashed. Franco obviously has great compassion for Glatze's inner torment. Michael seems lost. An orphan in the world. Looking for a place to belong. Quinto gives a subtle and deeply pained portrayal of a boyfriend who watches his partner vanish before his eyes. You never doubt the connection between the two men, their loving and deep relationship as a couple. It's necessary to get a sense of that so that what follows has the proper impact, and Kelly navigates those waters with his cast sensitively and well. In Franco's hands, Glatze is an inquiring and dogged iconoclast, pre-and post-conversion. As a gay man, he immersed himself in queer theory. As an \"ex-gay,\" he immersed himself in theology. His mindset was naturally extreme, the pendulum swinging far in each direction. It's not difficult to believe Franco as an intelligent and well-read man (despite the fact that he's played so many goofballs).\u00a0 Advertisement There are a couple of visual flourishes that are awkwardly executed and unnecessary (heads placed in the far corners of the frame, a couple of overhead shots that come from out of nowhere). There are some issues with establishing chronology as well as location. The action moves from Halifax to Colorado to San Francisco, and it's not entirely clear where anyone is at any given moment in time. Kelly is finding his sea-legs as a director. Kelly spends equal amounts of time with Michael's pre-conversion life as he does post-conversion. The conversion itself is pretty well done, all things considered. (Filming a man suddenly being filled with the love of Jesus is probably quite a challenge.) A fascinating detail of Franco's performance is that before the conversion his face is humorous and beautiful, his smile ready, and even in the midst of an argument he's open to all possibilities. He loves the fight. Post-conversion, a mask descends. There's a constant deeply-grooved wrinkle in his forehead. This is a man who cannot let himself be. Who has chosen to suppress who he is. You can see\u00a0the price he has paid for that suppression on his face. It's extremely sad.", "Critic": "Alpha"}

Salinger's \"Teddy,\" by way of the old anecdote about the group of blind men feeling an elephant and drawing wrong conclusions based on partial information.\u00a0 There's a danger of doing exactly that when writing about this peculiar and special nonfiction film. As directed and shot (mostly solo) by first-time feature filmmaker Amanda Rose Wilder, and as edited by Robert Greene (\"Actress\"), it's a truly old-school documentary, constructed in the manner of a 1960s \"direct cinema\" or \"fly on the wall\" feature. It tells its story without music, narration, graphs, or expert witnesses. It's committed to letting you decide what, if anything, it's trying to say, by putting you in the middle of a place, and letting you watch what happens. Advertisement That \"if anything\" is in the preceding sentence for a reason. After watching Wilder's movie a couple of times, I'm convinced that it might not be making any single, statement about free schools. More likely, it's trying to spark arguments about the core issues in education: the need for discipline and lesson plans and set subjects; the question of whether an authoritarian model of leadership is preferable or if you should let children (even very young ones) have a voice. The first part of the film suffers from a certain aimlessness. It seems a bit coy about deciding who its main characters are.\u00a0We don't necessarily need to have a conclusion foreshadowed for us. But early on, it's not easy to figure out why we're watching this black-and-white, handheld movie about a school that accepts kids who don't fit into more traditional institutions due to\u00a0learning\u00a0problems or\u00a0discipline\u00a0issues\u2014a hippie-ish place where anybody, adult or child, can call a meeting and discuss this or that, and students don't have to study a subject if they don't feel like it. \u00a0 The movie eventually zeroes in the school's founder and main teacher, Alex, and two strong-willed kids: a blank-faced, long-haired boy named Jiovanni, and a sunny-dispositioned blonde girl named Lucy.\u00a0Lucy likes roughhousing and goofing as much as any of the kids, but also likes to have rules in place, so that you know how far to go, and can ask somebody to back you up when you've decided enough is enough. Jiovanni is a spoiled, argumentative, often destructive brat with no regard for anyone's happiness but his own. As such, he's in the perfect (or worst possible) environment.\u00a0 This school seems at partly founded around the idea that people have an innate need for rules, laws, structure and so forth, and will eventually act in their best interests when a threat like Jiovanni emerges.\u00a0Is this true, though? Jiovanni's thuggish behavior keeps making it impossible for the other kids to learn or the teachers to teach, and they seem to take forever to unite against him, maybe because nobody wants to be the \"bad guy\" and puncture Utopia. Like most narcissists, Jiovanni doesn't care if people hate him as long as they can't ignore him.\u00a0In time, the other children go from being cowed by Jiovanni to vocally despising him. \"I'm getting the feeling that everybody else in the school doesn't want to be driven by Jio's likes,\" says another boy. Advertisement I wouldn't go so far as to say Wilder is \"just observing\" this conflict. I don't think there is any such thing as objectivity where filmmaking is concerned. The footage was collected one or two days each week over a one-year timespan, then shaped during editing to create a semblance of a narrative that builds to a surprisingly traditional (and exciting) climax.\u00a0 But it does seem fair to say that \"Approaching the Elephant\" isn't directing us toward any specific conclusion about what's right and wrong. If anything, it's arranging the footage in a way that will challenge or confirm the viewer's preconceived notions about a good education. (\"Is this really working?\" Alex asks at one point. \"We probably won't know for 20 years.\")\u00a0 The final act, during which the school is essentially held hostage to Jiovanni's snotty whims, made me furious. I don't believe in corporal punishment, but boys like him test that commitment. And even though I think the modern American school system is a quasi-fascistic holdover from an earlier time\u2014designed mainly to teach kids how to be obedient, voiceless cogs in an industrial economy that no longer exists\u2014parts of \"Approaching the Elephant\" made me wonder if free schools aren't an equally misguided over-correction.\u00a0 Reactions like mine are, I suspect, the whole point of making this particular film in this particular way. The movie is significant as a movie: it's intelligent, sensitive and expertly made. But it's also significant because of its ability to provoke introspection and arguments. In its\u00a0deceptively modest way, it's as much a Rorschach test as \"American Sniper.\" Everybody who sees it will draw a different picture of the elephant.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Bobbi Jene", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "When a film doesn't work, it's often because the intention behind it is not clear. What does the film want to convey? What is the point? What's the story? These are elemental but essential considerations. \"Bobbi Jene,\" Elvira Lind's documentary about Bobbi Jene Smith, a longtime dancer in Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin's Batsheva Dance Group, is unclear in its intentions. It doesn't know what it wants to be, or what story it wants to tell. The film is about a dancer, but there's not all that much dance in it. It's about a woman making a life-changing choice, but the movie itself has a very low-stakes atmosphere. Bobbi Jene Smith has had a unique life as a dancer, but her personal problems are extremely ordinary. Lind gets sucked into these personal matters to such a degree that they take over the film. \"Bobbi Jene,\" then, is really a film about Smith's love life, the challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship, dealing with parents who don't \"get it,\" fears that she might never have kids, that it's \"too late\" for her ... While these things are meaningful to those going through them, it is not especially interesting to watch, especially when Lind's intention is to profile a dancer whose work she clearly finds provocative. Advertisement Bobbi Jene Smith was attending Juilliard when Naharin's Batsheva Dance Group visited New York. After seeing one of the performances, she was so blown away she sought out Naharin to compliment him on his work. He invited her to join the company. Impulsively, she dropped out of school and moved to Israel to take him up on his offer. She was 21 years old. When \"Bobbi Jene\" opens, Smith, now 31, has decided to leave Batsheva and strike out on her own. She wants to see who she is as a dancer outside Naharin's intense circle of influence (they were also lovers at one point). She has lived in Israel for a decade, and makes the difficult decision to move back to the United States. She is in a relationship with Or, another dancer in Batsheva, but he is 10 years her junior, and doesn't want to leave the dance company yet. He tells her he wants to raise his future kids in Israel. They have a tearful goodbye (one of many) at the airport. Back in the States, she works on a solo show. Lind doesn't dig deep enough into Smith's process\u2014as a dancer, or as a choreographer\u2014to give us an idea of what the solo show is about, what the movements are meant to express. What's Smith's philosophy as a dancer? What's her style? The few comments Smith makes are banal (\"I want to get to that place where I have no strength to hide anything.\"). The footage we get of Smith's solo show, done completely in the nude, culminating in her grinding herself into a bag of sand, don't help. Lind doesn't show the dance in its totality, cutting away from the action to focus on the faces of audience members as we hear Smith grunting and moaning off-screen. She was barely out of her teenage years when she hitched her star to Naharin. Naharin's style and dance philosophy (\"gaga\") is known the world over, and Bobbi Jene flourished in that environment. What kind of work does she want to create on her own? More importantly though, does she have anything to say? These are fascinating concepts. (The recent \"Polina,\" while not a documentary, is about just that.) Smith's solo show, done at the Israeli Museum in Jerusalem, comes off as extremely literal, with its only goal personal catharsis, or maybe just exhibitionism. The tearful impressed responses of audience members afterwards left me thinking, \"I guess you had to be there.\" There had been some concern beforehand that her show would be controversial in the more conservative environment of Jerusalem. Instead, we are just shown the raves, the accolades. If there was any pushback, it's not included. Lind has instead spent most of her time on Bobbi Jene and Or's Skype-conversations, their bittersweet reunions, their struggles to maintain their relationship at such a far remove, Bobbi Jene crying about losing him, Bobbi Jene morosely folding her nephew's baby clothes, or staring longingly at diamond rings in a store window ... it's endless. We all have these problems. Who cares? Advertisement Earlier this year, Tomer Heymann's documentary \"Mr. Gaga,\" profiled Ohad Naharin and his work with Batsheva. Naharin is intimidating, handsome and intense, and he makes a compelling central figure. But \"Mr. Gaga\" was also a riveting dance film, its camera work and visual style carefully designed to capture Naharin's choreography in such a visceral way that watching the film was the next best thing to being there in the theatre. \"Bobbi Jene\" suffers by comparison, although the problem goes deeper than that. Lind has not found a way to show us what she\u00a0finds so interesting in Smith.", "Critic": "Alpha"}

That is to say, it feels like the \u201cThis is Spinal Tap\u201d for the Justin\r\nBieber generation. Credited as a \u201cLonely Island\u201d film, it is the work of the\r\nthree musically adept comic minds behind the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d digital shorts that were for a long time a mainstay and highlight of that comedy\r\nseries. The LI front man was, and remains, Andy Samberg, the trio member who\r\nwas also a full-time cast member of \u201cSNL.\u201d Their song pastiches combine raunchy\r\nhumor (you may recall \u201cD**k in a Box\u201d) with more-clever-than-normal wordplay\r\nfor stuff so raunchy-humor-based, with a lot of genuine absurdism all tied together by beats and melodies that are as\r\ncredible as those in, you know, genuine contemporary pop songs. Some of the\r\nsongs here are pretty jaw-dropping, and at first the frame\r\nconstructed around them seems pretty can\u2019t-miss.  Advertisement Samberg plays Conner4Real, a pop star who, as explained\r\nin fake-rock-doc-minus-Marty-DiBergi-style, started in a Beastie Boys-like trio\r\ncalled \u201cThe Style Boyz.\u201d Depicted doing their big hit \u201cKarate Boy,\u201d they are of\r\ncourse rather spectacularly inept, and their ineptitude is made rather funnier\r\nby real-life cameos from the likes of Questlove and Nas testifying to their\r\nvital influence\u2014\u201cAre you kidding me, that song changed my life,\u201d says Nas, with\r\nsufficient conviction to earn him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. But\r\nit\u2019s clear, at least to some unknown contingent, that Conner is the breakout\r\nstar of the group, and the Style Boyz\u2014the other two are played by the other\r\nLonely Island fellows, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone; they co-wrote the\r\nmovie with Samberg, and take the directorial credit with Samberg as producer\u2014disband. Owen (Taccone) becomes the DJ for Conner\u2019s solo act\u2014he has\r\nthe whole set on an iPod, which he also uses to listen to audiobooks on the\r\nroad\u2014while Schaffer\u2019s Lawrence becomes \u201ca farmer\u201d and carver of very awful wood\r\nsculptures.

The movie cheerfully\r\nskewers pretty much every convention of pop music manufacturing. Of his new\r\nalbum \u201cConnQuest,\u201d Conner says \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be surprise releasing it next\r\nThursday.\u201d His big artistic breakthrough is described as his pioneering of an\r\n\u201call-catchphrase\u201d guest rap on another artist\u2019s song. And more, and more, with\r\nexpert comic bits executed not just by the supporting cast proper, which\r\nincludes Tim Meadows and Sarah Silverman, but also by a near-endless stream of\r\ncameo performers drawn from Samberg\u2019s circles in both music and comedy and the\r\nplace on the showbiz Venn Diagram where they meet. The movie also happens to\r\ncontain one of the sharpest, and most pointed, send-ups of TMZ I\u2019ve ever seen.\r\nAnd then there are the songs, one a \u201csincere\u201d plea for marital equality that\r\nquickly devolves into Conner\u2019s own perhaps-protesting-too-much declaration of\r\nhis own sexual preferences. The \u201clive\u201d version of a number referencing Osama\r\nbin Laden is also a treat.  But, the movie\u2019s storyline is, truth to tell, a little thin.\r\nIt\u2019s pretty much the same scenario as the aforementioned \u201cThis is Spinal Tap,\u201d with\r\ndifferent structural stresses. That is, the \u201cband\u201d in this movie breaks up\r\npretty early on, but the quixotic nature of Conner\u2019s, um, new direction is so\r\nplain that certain inevitable scenes feel more inevitable than actually earned,\r\nwhich was never a problem with \u201cThis is Spinal Tap.\u201d And there are peaks and valleys to\r\nthe movie that are too noticeable. The movie\u2019s a tidy 90 minutes or so, but\r\nit starts to sag at the hour-mark and doesn\u2019t get its oomph back for a while.\r\nAll that said, though, what\u2019s good about this movie is funny, and refreshing,\r\nenough to make the dry spots feel more tolerable in retrospect.

{"Title": "7 Boxes", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Everything has a price in Juan Carlos Maneglia and Tana Sch\u00e9mbori's \"7 Boxes\". You want something? You better have something to trade, be it information, money (hard to come by), or one of those nifty new cell phones with a video camera. \"7 Boxes\" takes place in a 48-hour period within the sprawling Byzantine maze of a Paraguayan market. Everyone knows everyone. It is 2005. Cell phones are still a novelty, let alone ones that can take pictures and videos. You could do anything if you had one. They are currency. Currency, and what it means in different situations, is the underlying theme of \"7 Boxes\", its urgent motor. The brutality of capitalism is not critiqued by any of the characters because they are too concerned with survival to worry themselves over concepts, but the implications are clear. You can't get anything in this world, drugs for your sick child, a girlfriend, a cell phone, without currency.  Advertisement Victor (Celso Franco) is a kid who works as a delivery boy in the market. He has a rickety wheelbarrow and he hustles customers to let him carry their goods. Victor is young and wily. He's also captivated by anything that has a \r\nscreen: security cameras, used televisions, his friend Liz's cell phone \r\nwith a video. He wants one. He has no money. So when he is suddenly offered a weird gig by a sleazy butcher to transport seven boxes with contents unknown away from the butcher's shop (surrounded by cops), he jumps at the chance. Unbeknownst to Victor, another guy named Nelson (V\u00edctor Sosa) was supposed to get that delivery job, only he was late for the pick-up. Nelson, a desperate man with a sick son, sets out to find Victor and steal the seven boxes so he can collect the payment which he sees as rightfully his.  There's nothing like a strong set-up, and the set-up in \"7 Boxes\" is powerful, simple and dramatic. What is in the boxes? Why are they so important? Cops prowl through the market, but they are as corrupt and on-the-make as everyone else. Everyone can be bribed. Cell phones are passed around, from pocket to pocket, and, in one funny scene, a cell phone is stolen, and Victor, thinking he's calling the butcher, gets the thief instead. \"Can I speak to Mr. Dario?\" \"This is my phone now. I'm the thief who stole his phone.\" \"Oh, okay. Bye.\"  Victor has a sister (Nelly Davalos), who works in the kitchen of a Korean restaurant, and a friend named Liz (Lali Gonzalez), who tags along with him, but other than that his whole world is his wheelbarrow and the market, as well as the pull of any television screen in his vicinity. No matter how tense the moment is, Victor stops in his tracks to stare at the images, commercials, American movies dubbed in Spanish, and even himself on security-camera footage. What is it he sees? Escape? Wealth? Fame? Whatever it is, it represents the irresistible allure of a life where currency is available, up for grabs, where there's more than enough money to go around. Victor has no resentment about his poverty. He is too busy trying to survive being chased by Nelson and by the cops. But he is pulled up and out of himself, through the technology proliferating around him in endless screens.  Advertisement As it becomes clear to him that the seven boxes are bad news, and that he is in serious trouble, he hides the boxes. That doesn't work out well. Liz steals the boxes, to help him out, and then he steals them back. Meanwhile, Nelson has gathered together a gang of desperate people willing to help track down Victor in order to get a piece of Nelson's payment. The chase takes them through the market, its random dance clubs, and lunch counters, its back alleys, and warehouse spaces. Some of these scenes, crowded, busy, frenetic, are reminiscent of some of Jafar Panahi's films, with their use of actors who don't seem like actors at all racing through real-life urban settings.  Victor is on the run, but he has nowhere to go. He never leaves the market. But as the competing circles close in on him, as the seven terrible boxes loom in portent, he and his friend Liz huddle against an iron gate, hiding, and suddenly, impulsively, he leans in and kisses her. He obviously had wanted to kiss her for a while. Their relationship is the teasing annoyed banter that screams romantic tension. But perhaps he saw a movie star kiss a girl like that once, and perhaps it gave him courage, it showed him how.  \"7 Boxes\" is both a tense and frightening crime film as well as a sometimes-dreamy evocation of life in the sprawling underclass, its hallucinatory aspects, its chaos and violence, its fantasies.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Nuts!", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In Buster Keaton's 1922 film \"Cops,\" Keaton, for reasons too complicated to go into, finds himself sitting in a cart full of furniture, trying to get his horse to move faster. Keaton makes a pit-stop at a \"Goat Gland Specialist,\" and hustles the horse through the door. Moments later, standing on the sidewalk, he looks around furtively, making sure no one is watching, and turns and strolls into the specialist's office himself. That scene would have killed in 1922, but perhaps modern audiences need back-story. Penny Lane's wonderfully entertaining documentary \"Nuts!\" may provide, among other things, enlightenment on what Buster Keaton (and his sluggish horse) might have been looking for through that doorway.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Nuts!\" presents the life-story of a man named John R. Brinkley, whose fame spread far and wide in the 1920s and 1930s. Apparently, one day a farmer visited Brinkley's druggist's shop in Milford, Kansas (population 300), and asked for help because he was a \"flat tire\" sexually, Dr. Brinkley got the idea of removing \"good nuts\" from billy-goats and inserting them into the \"bad nuts\" of impotent men. Brinkley experimented, and it worked! The farmer had a spring in his step again, happy erections, and potent sperm filled with child-bearing potential. And so began the heyday of Dr. Brinkley. Brinkley opened a hospital, a herd of virile goats chewing grass on the lawn in front. Milford became a boom town, people traveling from across the country to have the goat gland procedure. Children were born to couples who had given up. Men could satisfy their wives again with their sexual performance. Miracle! Penny Lane's previous film, \"Our Nixon,\" took a well-known story and viewed it from an unexpected perspective, using the intimate humorous \"home\" movies made by the Praetorian Guard around President Nixon in the first years of the administration.\u00a0Lane has a gift for finding the unexpected in the familiar, the right narrative structure, however eccentric, to tell a story.\u00a0 Her documentaries are not your typical \"talking head\" affairs. \"Nuts!\" utilizes only a couple \"talking heads,\" each with their own area of expertise. James Reardon shares his knowledge of the history of Kansas, its demographics and politics (Brinkley, a famous man, eventually ran for office). Megan Seaholm, a medical historian, delves into the history of the AMA and its campaign against \"quackery.\" Gene Fowler is radio historian (Brinkley's main contribution to the world may have nothing to do with goat glands but his pioneering use of radio technology.) The most striking part of \"Nuts!\" is its extensive use of animation. Multiple animators were on the team. At first the animation consists of greys and faded ivories and watercolor-smudged blacks, perfect for portraying the dawning decades of the new century. As the years go by, color starts to flash into it (one man's electric-blue suit stark against the faceless mass of black-shadowed people behind him). The animation is abstract, sometimes nightmarish, and often very funny. Its imagery is like a sophisticated graphic novel. Accompanying the animation is the superb voice-over work done by Andy Boswell, John Causby, Kelly Mizell, Jeff Pillars, Thom Stylinski and Fran Taylor. They play a cast of hundreds, each voice distinct, the language often direct quotes from the public record (one farmer testifies at a hearing, bluntly, unashamed: \"I used to have a floppy dong, but it ain't floppy no more.\") Current animated films use name actors for all of the voices, and many of them do wonderful work, but sometimes what you need are practiced mimics, chameleons, funny-voice experts. These voiceover artists are convincing as uneducated farmers, prudish old ladies, sinister politicians, snooty doctors, and whispering crowds of scandalized people.\u00a0 Advertisement There are surprises along the way, bombshells even, events that made front-page news across the country at the time. Brinkley is presented as a plucky pioneer, solving people's sexual ills and using his popular radio show to educate his listeners about sex (Fowler, the radio historian, calls Brinkley the \"Dr. Ruth Westheimer of the 1920s\"). But there's more to it, and Lane dispenses it in fragments so that it feels like you're reading along with the newspapers of the day. Lane has tracked down extensive home movie and newsreel footage, as well as snippets of Brinkley's various radio addresses. Brinkley was a man who understood publicity and the power of personality. So there's footage of Brinkley in his garden, Brinkley and his wife and child lounging by a pool, Brinkley and his son catching fish, the Brinkley family boarding their private plane (purchased from Charles Lindbergh).\u00a0 There are multiple relevant critiques in the content, should you be looking for them. There were debates about health care during those decades, about the population wanting the right to choose their own doctors. Medicine used to be mostly guess-work, doctors using leeches, purges, enemas, on ailing people, the cures often more deadly than the illness itself. Once doctors started consolidating themselves into associations, the independents were run out of town on a rail. Sharing knowledge and peer review became mandatory. Dr. Morris Fishbein fought with evangelical fanaticism to eradicate \"quacks,\" his main target being Brinkley. \"It's not medicine Dr. Brinkley is practicing,\" thundered Fishbein. \"It's big business!\" Fishbein, incidentally, was excellent friends with H.L. Mencken, the cranky \"sage of Baltimore,\" who wrote essay after essay throughout the 1920s, attacking \"quackery\" and snake-oil salesmen and \"herbalists,\" stating in no uncertain terms:\u00a0 \"What is needed is a scientific inquiry into the matter, under rigid test conditions, by a committee of men learned in the architecture and plumbing of the body, and of a high and incorruptible sagacity.\" Quackery or no, there's a reason audiences in 1922 would have been rolling in the aisles seeing Buster Keaton slip furtively through that goat gland door. Lane helps us understand why.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Good Time", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "There\u2019s a hum to the night of major cities. It\u2019s the sound of unceasing traffic, neon lights buzzing, televisions on in every apartment, and more, and it creates a unique energy that you don\u2019t find outside of places like New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, etc. It\u2019s the kind of anxious energy that comes with a lack of sleep\u2014paranoid and twitchy. That hum pervades the Safdie brothers\u2019 excellent \u201cGood Time,\u201d a film that reminds me of great \u201ccity movies\u201d of the \u201870s like \u201cMean Streets\u201d and \u201cDog Day Afternoon.\u201d With a central performance from Robert Pattinson that feels like a direct descendant of Al Pacino\u2019s in that Lumet film, \u201cGood Time\u201d is a movie that can\u2019t sit still, and I mean that in the best possible way. There\u2019s a palpable sense of anxiety and panic that comes through in every heated frame after the film\u2019s inciting incident. It\u2019s one of those rare movies that makes you feel edgy, conveying its protagonist\u2019s dilemma in ways that prey on your nerves and emotions more than just relaying a night-from-hell anecdote. Advertisement \u201cGood Time\u201d opens with one of its only relatively sedate scenes (although even it is filmed in such a way that it feels tense). Nick Nikas (the film\u2019s co-director Ben Safdie) sits uncomfortably in a court-ordered therapy session. Through the exchange with his doctor (Peter Verby), we learn that Nick was violent with his grandmother, and that he\u2019s mentally handicapped enough to not fully understand how to control his anger or the social repercussions of his actions. Just as the therapist is getting somewhere, Nick\u2019s brother Connie (Pattinson) bursts in and takes Nick out of the room. Connie thinks he\u2019s doing good by protecting his brother\u2014of course, he is not. And this will be a theme of the night ahead of Connie, one in which he\u2019ll constantly try to fix a situation but only make it worse. The movie proper opens with a bank robbery. Nick and Connie want $65,000 from a bank and appear to get away with it before a dye pack covers them, and their payload, in bright red dye. Nick gets nabbed by the cops, sending him to Rikers Island. Too much of the robbery money is ruined to make his bail, so Connie needs to come up with $10k as quickly as possible to get him out. He starts with his girlfriend (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and, well, things get crazier from there in ways that I wouldn\u2019t dare spoil.  Working again with the great cinematographer Sean Price Williams (who shot the Safdies\u2019 \u201cHeaven Knows What,\u201d Alex Ross Perry\u2019s \u201cQueen of Earth,\u201d and others), the Safdies give \u201cGood Time\u201d a claustrophobic energy that\u2019s hard to fully convey in a review. It\u2019s accomplished through intense close-ups and a style that could be called jittery but never calls too much attention to itself. It\u2019s a visual language designed to enhance the enhance the mood of its leading man without distracting from it, and it works remarkably with an assist by a pulsing score from Daniel Lopatin.  Advertisement Having said that, most of what shines so well about \u201cGood Time\u201d can be traced back to Robert Pattinson\u2019s performance, the best of an already-impressive career. He is impossible to ignore from his very first scene, expressing Connie\u2019s ability to only keep digging himself deeper and deeper into trouble. Connie makes choices instantly, and one gets the impression that it\u2019s an instinctual ability that has helped him at times but will only prove his downfall on this particular night. \u201cGood Time\u201d is essentially one long chase movie\u2014the story of a man trying to evade capture for a bank robbery and get his brother out of the predicament into which he threw him\u2014and Pattinson perfectly conveys the nervous energy of being essentially hunted by your own bad decisions without ever feeling like he\u2019s chewing scenery. Like Pacino in the \u201870s, there\u2019s something in the eyes and the body language, an unease about what\u2019s going to happen next, an inability to sit down. It is a stunning performance, and one of the best of 2017 by far. By and large, films are passive experiences. We sit in the dark and allow stories to play out in front of us, behind the safety of the movie screen. Movies like \u201cGood Time\u201d that break down that comfort and make us as edgy as their protagonists are rare and should be embraced.

{"Title": "Watchers of the Sky", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "In August of 1941, Winston Churchill made a speech, broadcast on the  BBC, where he said, \"The whole of Europe has been wrecked and trampled  down by the mechanical weapons and barbaric fury of the Nazis\u2026As his  armies advance, whole districts are exterminated\u2026We are in the  presence of a crime without a name.\" The Nazis did not invent the  concept of the calculated extermination of an entire people, although  modern technology helped them be more efficient in their methods. It was  Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew obsessed since childhood with man's  inhumanity to man, who gave that crime a very specific name, \"genocide\".  \"Watchers of the Sky,\" an intricate and immensely powerful documentary,  directed by Edet Belzberg, is both the story of Raphael Lemkin as well  as a harrowing examination of genocide, past, recent, and ongoing. Advertisement Partially inspired by Samantha Power's extraordinary Pulitzer-Prize  winning book about genocide, \"A Problem From Hell\" (the title coming  from then Secretary of State Warren Christopher's comment that the  Balkans, following the breakup of the Soviet Union, was \"a problem from  hell\"), \"Watchers of the Sky\" covers so much ground and weaves together  so many stories that it is not a surprise that it won the best editing  award at Sundance. The past bleeds into the present, and the present  then dissolves into the past, accurately reflecting the subject matter.  Lines of refugees in 1939 Poland dissolve into lines of refugees from  current-day Syria or the Sudan, going from black-and-white footage to  color and back. The device tells the story better than any language ever  could. Much of the film is about policy-making, and tireless lobbying,  the wrangling of legalese and courtroom struggles, potentially dry  stuff, but turned urgent and humane in Belzberg's hands. As with Power's book, the story of Raphael Lemkin's single-minded quest  to make genocide an international crime is the thematic thru-line, the  thread holding it all together. As current counterpoints to Lemkin,  continuing his thwarted legacy, \"Watchers of the Sky\" introduces us to  four other people who have devoted their lives to combating genocide  (one of them being Samantha Power, currently the United States  ambassador to the United Nations, with decades of experience as a war  journalist; she is our guide through the biography of Lemkin). First,  there is Emmanuel Uwurukundo, who survived the genocide in Rwanda,  losing the majority of his family. Now he works for the UN Refugee  Agency, overseeing three refugee camps in Chad filled with people  fleeing the conflict in Darfur. Ben Ferencz, a Hungarian-born Jew now in  his 90s, was a prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials (and knew Lemkin  personally). Still active as a lobbyist, he is shown circling the seats  at the U.N. before a session, handing out pamphlets, bantering, joking,  gossiping. Finally, we also meet Luis Moreno Ocampo, currently the chief  prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, who cut his teeth in  the 1985 Trial of the Juntas in his homeland, Argentina. Working with a  team of investigators, Moreno Ocampo is seen building a case against  Sudanese president Omar al Bashir. He wants to issue an arrest warrant  on behalf of the ICC, saying chillingly in a press conference, \"We  cannot wait for him to finish his work.\" Lemkin was born in 1900 in Bezwodne, Poland, territory that had been  passed back and forth between empires for generations. As a child,  Lemkin read \"Quo Vadis,\" by Henryk Sienkiewicz, which told the story of  the Roman Empire's persecution of early Christians. It got him to  thinking. Why did man do this? Why was it not a crime? Why was the  murder of an individual punishable by law but not the murder of  millions? Could anything be done to stop it? These would be the  questions that would obsess him for his entire life. The 1921 killing of  the former Turkish prime minister by an Armenian who screamed as he  pulled the trigger, \"This is to avenge the death of my family!\" made an  impression on Lemkin, and he began to see such events as occurring in a  long bloody continuum, back to the days described in \"Quo Vadis.\" When  Germany invaded Poland, Lemkin was unable to convince his parents to  come with him to America. He came alone, becoming that natural byproduct  of genocide, that entity he had read about and dreaded since he was a  child, a refugee. Advertisement Once in the United States, Lemkin talked to anyone who would listen (and  many would run the other way when they saw him coming) about the fact  that what was happening to the Jews in Germany and Poland and elsewhere  was not an aberration, but an ongoing eternal problem that needed to be  addressed. As a studier of languages, Lemkin grappled with what to  actually call this \"crime without a name\". He filled notebooks with  rough drafts. What he needed was a word that that the civilized world  would recoil from, as one. In her book, Power writes, \"The word that  Lemkin settled upon was a hybrid that combined the Greek derivative geno, meaning 'race' or 'tribe,' together with the  Latin derivative cide, from caedere, meaning \"killing.' 'Genocide' was short, it  was novel, and it was not likely to be mispronounced. Because of the  word's lasting association with Hitler's horrors, it would also send  shudders down the spines of those who heard it.\" Lemkin's faith in language may seem naive, and many thought so at the  time. He was a curious figure, rumpled and fanatical, traveling to the  Nuremberg Trials, haunting the halls of the brand new U.N., firing off  thousands of letters to people all over the world, diplomats and human  rights groups and politicians, looking for support for his idea that  genocide prevention was in everybody's best interest. \"Watchers of the Sky\" breaks up all of this material with haunting and  eerie watercolor-looking animation, of dark forests or rolling fields  filled with ghostly silhouettes of people, the figures slowly  dissolving, one by one, leaving an empty landscape. Lemkin's handwriting  from his notebooks unfurls across the screen, slowly, beautifully,  making him into a living witness to the horrors we see today. The  questions he asked, the solutions he proposed (many of which have come  into fruition, flawed though they may be), all hover over the landscape  in Chad, the lines of refugees waiting to be processed, some of whom  have lived in the camp for three or four years now. The sheer amount of  information that Belzberg had to organize, and fit into a seamless  whole, is awe-inspiring. The pace feels like an unstoppable river, the  current of history, the continuum of atrocity that Lemkin and others  sensed. There are those who see genocide (and its regular dance-partner,  millions of refugees) as an intractable issue, in Warren Christopher's  hopeless phrase, a \"problem from hell.\" Lemkin saw the problem,  witnessed it and experienced it, but turned his energy into asking,  obsessively, the eternal question, \"What is to be done about it?\"  \"Watchers of the Sky\" warns against apathy and hopelessness. It believes  in the importance of language, of calling things by their proper names,  and of being strong enough to be able to recognize real evil. In 1941,  Adolf Hitler famously said to his military brass, \"The aim of war is not  to reach definite lines but to annihilate the enemy physically. It is  by this means that we shall obtain the vital living space that we need.  Who today still speaks of the massacre of the Armenians?\" The slogan \"Never again\" is meaningless without some sort of law to back  it up. What that might actually look like is still a work in progress;  work that \"Watchers in the Sky\" highlights. Lemkin's work, continued.  While the film is not optimistic, and it does not provide \"hope for the  future\" or anything equally as facile, it is a powerful reminder of the  importance of the struggle itself.

{"Title": "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\"Batman\r\nv Superman: Dawn of Justice\" is state of the art epic superhero\r\nfilmmaking. That's a compliment if you prefer these movies to be ponderous,\r\ndisorganized and glum, but a warning if you prefer tonal variation from film to\r\nfilm and scene to scene, and have a soft spot for storytelling that actually\r\ntells, you know, a story, as opposed to doing an occasionally inspired\r\nbut mostly just competent job of setting up the next chapter in a Marvel-styled\r\nfranchise. The\r\nstory begins with yet another flashback to young Bruce Wayne witnessing his\r\nparents' murder by a gun-wielding mugger, followed by a bracketing trauma, his\r\nencounter with a flock of bats in a cave near stately Wayne Manor. As co-written\r\nby Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer (\u201cBlade,\u201d \u201cDark City\u201d) and directed by Zack\r\nSnyder (\"Man of Steel,\" \"Sucker Punch,\" et al), this\r\nsequence initially plays like one more visit to a dried up well. But it makes sense when\r\nyou get to the next scene, a replay of the Metropolis-leveling \"Man of\r\nSteel\" showdown between Superman (Henry Cavill) and General Zod (Michael\r\nShannon) from the point-of-view of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck), who sees\r\nhundreds of members of his adopted professional \"family\" killed when\r\nWayne Industries' Metropolis office is damaged in the super-fight. (The\r\nsequence also portrays Wayne as a somewhat detached one-percenter who\u2019s ashamed\r\nat having taken his work \"family\" for granted\u2014a thoughtful touch.)  Advertisement This\r\nis the film's most affecting and original sequence, in large part because it\r\ntakes a persistent complaint against \"Man of Steel\"\u2014that the supposed\r\nBoy Scout from Krypton was callously oblivious to collateral damage\u2014and retrofits\r\nit, so that it looks like something \u201cMan of Steel\u201d always meant to do, the\r\nbetter to provide strong, simple motivation for Bruce. Re-traumatized by a 9/11-style\r\ndisaster that kills dozens of his employees, including a young girl\u2019s mother, he channels his anger\r\nand helplessness into a preemptive war against Superman, to be carried with biomechanical armor and Bat-tech fortified by Kryptonite. He sees Kal-El as a clueless and careless false god whose powers must be neutralized,\r\nlest humans get so comfortable with worshiping \"aliens\" that they set\r\nthe stage for a takeover by more Zods.  I keep referring to the cowled hero as Bruce because, more so than any\r\nBatman picture, \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d treats the Caped Crusader as a scary-awesome\r\nmanifestation of ordinary neuroses, practically a lycanthropic rodent-beast who emerges\r\nat night, summoned by his own monogrammed spotlight-moon. In comparison,\r\nSuperman seems a more balanced character: aside from the presence or absence of\r\nglasses or a cape and the stress of maintaining his cover story (he gets so\r\npreoccupied by an unauthorized investigation of Batman\u2019s vigilantism that he\r\nstarts screwing up his regular duties at the Planet), Clark Kent and Superman are essentially the same guy.  The title promises an even distribution of screen time. But despite the\r\npresences of touchstone DC characters\u2014including a smarmy, psychotic,\r\ntech-douche version of Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg, fidgeting and yammering\r\nlike Jeremy Davies); ageless Amazon warrior Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot); ace\r\nreporter and Superman gal pal Lois Lane (Amy Adams); Alfred the Butler (Jeremy\r\nIrons); Daily Planet editor Perry\r\nWhite (Laurence Fishburne) and Ma Kent (Diane Lane)\u2014this is ultimately an\r\noverstuffed, overpopulated, awkwardly plotted Batman picture that relegates the\r\nMan of Steel to a glorified supporting role. (If industry reports are to be believed,\r\nthis was a last minute decision by Warner Bros., which preferred the financial safe-bet\r\nBatman to the recently revitalized Supes.)  Advertisement Unfortunately, the script\u2019s early promise recedes as the movie unreels. \u201cBatman vs. Superman\u201d is a disorganized, lead-footed movie\r\nthat carries itself with unearned confidence; you see every card it\u2019s about to\r\nplay ten minutes before the movie plays it, yet Snyder doesn\u2019t just slap each\r\none down on the table with gusto, he keeps pointing to it and telling you what rank\r\nand suit it is. We surely would have surmised that the identical first names of Bruce\u2019s dead\r\nbiological mother and Kal-El\u2019s adoptive mother\u2014Martha\u2014would come into play\r\neventually, but the film is so worried that somebody might not get it\r\nthat it has Thomas Wayne croak \u201cMartha\u201d with his dying breath, then finds\r\nways to keep repeating \u201cMartha\u201d over the next two hours, building\r\ntoward a reprise-flashback of Bruce\u2019s parents\u2019 murder that will bring latecomers up to speed. There are other repetitious touches along these lines, including multiple,\r\nvocal assurances that the characters are fighting in depopulated areas\u2014a clumsy defensive strike against \u201cMan of Steel\u201d hand-wringing. It all seems pointless\r\nwhen you realize how little effort has been devoted to embellishing the characters\r\nin Snyder\u2019s \u201cNashville\u201d-sized cast, none of whom come alive as they did in Tim Burton\u2019s\r\nor Christopher Nolan\u2019s or even Joel Schumacher\u2019s Batman pictures. Eisenberg\u2019s\r\nLuthor might have been a fascinating third panel in the movie\u2019s gallery of lonely and haunted man-children (in a harrowing moment, he rails against \u201cdaddy\u2019s fist\r\nand abominations\u201d), but he mostly comes off as a 21st century\r\nbrogrammer, all tics and threats and unwanted physical advances. Adams\u2019 Lois\r\nLane is once again reduced to a poker-faced damsel in distress. Jeremy Irons\u2019\r\nAlfred isn\u2019t a patch on Michael Gough\u2019s or Michael Caine\u2019s. Gadot, a lithe\r\nbeauty with a musical accent and a steely demeanor, is granted less depth than a typical Bond girl. The movie shows little interest in explaining or\r\njustifying its knotted-up subplots, and its detours into franchise-building are\r\noften self-defeating. The most misguided is a dog-leg near the end: just when\r\nthe story starts building up a head of steam, it pauses for a recitation of the\r\nDC heroes we can expect to see in the first full-on Justice League movie.  \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d tries to compensate for these flaws and others through\r\nsheer scale and volume. It\u2019s two-and-a-half hours long, louder than an airstrip\r\nat O\u2019Hare, gins up \u201cexcitement\u201d with shaky-cam footage and hyperactive\r\ncutting, and has both figuratively and literally dark images. Even its daylight\r\nscenes seem to occur at dusk, thanks to the way Snyder and his cinematographer Larry\r\nFong bleed the color out and shroud the characters in smoke. Luthor\u2019s mutant Kryptonian monstrosity Doomsday\u2014spoiler warning not\r\nrequired; its presence was revealed in PR photos and promotional footage weeks\r\nago\u2014is a generic hell-beast, all ropy muscles, spiky\r\nencrustations, and Rancor-like teeth. Reports of a forthcoming \u201cR\u201d-rated\r\nDVD version aren\u2019t surprising: the movie\u2019s juicy stabbings, brandings-by-Batarang,\r\nclose-quarters gunshots, scenes of sadistic kidnapping and torment, and generally\r\ndespairing tone are Urban Thriller 101. The film is more effective when it\u2019s\r\nchanneling expressionist horror movies by filming action from disorienting angles\r\nand letting blood seep from strange nooks and crannies. When it borrows iconic designs\r\nand situations from its primary inspiration, Frank Miller's politically satirical, meticulously plotted graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns, it\u2019s like a kid stumbling around in dad\u2019s\r\nboots. Advertisement There are a few brilliantly realized moments, the acting is mostly strong despite\r\nthe weak script (Affleck and Cavill are both superb\u2014Affleck unexpectedly so),\r\nand there's enough mythic raw material sunk deep in every scene that you can\r\npiece together a classic in your mind if you're feeling charitable; but if you\r\naren't, \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d will seem like a missed opportunity. At times it might\r\nmake you long for Christopher Nolan's delicate touch. Those last four words\r\nhave never appeared side-by-side before. Life\u2019s funny that way.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Rape of Recy Taylor", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Nancy Buirski\u2019s documentary \u201cThe Rape of Recy Taylor\" is a heartfelt work on a powerful subject: the rape of a black woman in Abbeville, Alabama in 1944 by a group of white men, a crime that disappeared into the larger history of the south for racial reasons. It's also a testament to how hard it is to make a documentary about an event for which few visual records\u00a0exists.  The subject is Recy Taylor, a 24-year old woman who was kidnapped on her way home from church and assaulted by six men\u2014a crime that was later rationalized as consensual sex on grounds that Taylor was a prostitute. (She wasn't.) To reconstruct this outrage, Buirski weaves together interviews with mostly elderly people from that time and place, in particular Taylor\u2019s brother Robert Corbitt and his sister Alma Daniels (who died in 2016). Taylor herself also appears fleetingly, though she's she's not a lucid presence. The movie also gives us a sense of the initial investigation, which was overseen by none other than future Montgomery bus boycott instigator Rosa Parks, sent from Montgomery, Alabama in hopes of drawing national press attention to the crime\u2014the only way, then and now, to get justice for marginalized people who live outside of major cities.\u00a0  Advertisement This is all fascinating. But you quickly get the sense that Buirski either doesn't find it interesting enough to let it stand on its own or else is afraid that audiences will rebel against too many bare-bones elements.  If the latter, she might not be wrong. There was a time when it was considered OK to build a story from the past around images of people talking about the events, plus still photographs and new film footage of the places where they happened. You still see documentaries like that on TV sometimes (though they are very likely to include re-creations with actors). Nevertheless, the approach she's chosen here is more often irritating than illuminating, and at times\u00a0suggests a lack of faith in the inherent power of the elements she has on hand. The personal testimony and historical reconstruction in this film are constantly being intercut with footage from low-budget black-and-white movies produced in the 1940s with African-American casts. These were made to appeal to an under-served market: the millions of black American moviegoers who otherwise would've had no chance to see people onscreen who looked like them. They played in the American Midwest, South and Southwest, mainly, on what was known as \"the chitlin circuit,\" an assortment of venues that could pass for movie theaters: churches, barns, nightclubs and other structures with walls wide enough for movie projection and enough floor space for a crowd. Chitlin circuit movies are fascinating in their own right, but the representative snippets we see here are treated as stock footage, or the equivalent of a \"historical recreation\" that you might see in a History Channel documentary. \u00a0Any innate artistic purposes they may have had is obliterated. Sometimes the filmmaker cuts them together with David Lynchian shots of the woods at night, leafless branches clawing at the sky. Meanwhile, an ominous and depressive and repetitive score churns.  I suppose you could make an argument that the chitlin circuit films connect with the story itself, in that they both reveal something about how race determines whether or not certain people's voices get heard. But if that's the point, it doesn't come across. What's onscreen here is often so very busy that \"The Rape of Recy Taylor\"  turns into a parody of a certain mindset in American documentary filmmaking. There is a tendency among some\u00a0directors to want to turn every new nonfiction feature into a dazzling visionary statement when it would've been perfectly OK to let the material be and find some way to explain to the audience why there are gaps or why certain parts feel a bit patched together.  Advertisement There's a section early in this movie that cuts together\u00a0a witness' testimony with bits of a chitlin circuit film and shots of the woods at night while, simultaneously, not one but two kinds of music play on the soundtrack: the original score and chopped-up bits of Dinah Washington's classic performance of \"This Bitter Earth,\" use most memorably in Charles Burnett's \"Killer of Sheep.\"\u00a0It's as if an architect had decided to \"help out\" a single red rose by erecting a jumbled postmodern skyscraper around it.

{"Title": "Wish Upon", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "\"Wish Upon\" is another one of those movies that would be memorable if it were a lot better or a lot worse. Joey King (\"Oz the  Great and Powerful\") stars as Claire Shannon, a teenage girl whose mother  killed herself years earlier. Claire grew up into an unhappy teenager who feels like a pariah and gets bullied. She's also humiliated that her father, Jonathan  (Ryan Phillippe), dumpster-dives all over town, even across the street  from her school. Then her dad finds a mysterious box inscribed with  Chinese characters. It's a wishing box that gives its owner seven  wishes. The downside is, every time a wish comes true, somebody dies. And we're off! Advertisement That  sounds like a decent setup for a schlock horror flick, but it's hard to  tell what director John R. Leonetti (\"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\") and  writer Barbara Marshall saw in this story. The screenplay made The  Black List, an annual film industry survey of the \"most liked\"  unproduced screenplays. But it's tough to discern from the evidence  onscreen that anybody could see something remarkable in this material,  besides the possibility of making money from people who thought they'd  be getting a great or even good horror film, as opposed to one of those  here-and-gone time-wasters that I used to watch at the dollar theater when  I was a kid. The best thing you can say about it is that the acting is  alright, there are a few decently executed moments of nastiness, the whole thing is in focus and you can understand what's being said. There's  not much internal logic to the way the script sets up Claire. She's made  out to be a pariah, but she has two spirited, funny, attractive friends  (Sydney Park and Shannon Purser, aka Barb on \"Stranger Things\"), and  when she's bullied, she stands up for herself immediately. The  characters speak in outdated '80s and '90s slang (\"Bitchin'!\" \"No way.\"  \"Yes, way\"), and they are often played by actors who seem too old, or at  least too self-possessed, to be teenagers. The conception of all the  young characters feels like an older screenwriter's idea of what it  means to be young and American at this point in history. This all  matters because originality and specificity would've set the story apart  and made it seem special.\u00a0  The story is steeped in  Orientalist cliches that are also very '80s. The box exudes The Ominous  Mystery of the Far East, and Claire has a crush on a Chinese American  classmate named Ryan Hui (Ki Long Hee of \"The Maze Runner\"), who takes  the box to his cousin Gina (Alice Lee), who translates the characters in  exchange for an order of won tons. The script thinks that if it  makes the Asian characters  cool, and includes a couple of lines shading Claire for stereotyping  Chinese people, it won't seem like it's wallowing in the same cultural cliches that  drive older horror and fantasy films. This is also the kind of movie where one of the  heroine's friends chastises her late in the story for wasting her seven wishes  on popularity and personal riches when she could be using the box to  solve world hunger; this comment plays like a preemptive strike against  criticism, and only serves to remind us that the movie can't or won't explore its central idea in anything but a perfunctory way. Nor is \"Wish Upon\" willing to crank up the outrageousness and  really go for it\u2014a scenario that might've at least secured a spot in the Midnight Movie Hall of Fame. Advertisement \"Wish Upon\" livens up  whenever the box extracts its blood price, but only a little. Nobody ever dies in an unremarkable way, only through  chain reaction slapstick mishaps that involve garbage disposals, chainsaws, deadly bathtub spigots and the like. Even routine car accidents are staged to  make the impact seem at once tragic and silly. But the kills aren't enough to  distinguish the film, much less save it. The violent scenes might play  as outrageous, in midnight movie fashion, if the direction were  capable of putting an intention, any intention, across. Instead, the bloodletting plays  as leaden and self-important, as if we're supposed to be deeply  horrified by what the film shows us and come away thinking about it. I laughed at it, not because it's disturbing or deliberately hilarious, but because the movie seems blissfully unaware of what it wants to do, or could do.  (If you like this kind of thing, the \"Final Destination\" series does it  better.) The movie is almost worth seeing for the scenes where the  heroine's dad reconnects with his love of the saxophone and blats out  obviously prerecorded instrumental stylings that sound like smooth jazz  in the vein of Kenny G. Here, at long last, is the bone-chilling horror  you were waiting for.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Arrival", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Much has been written about the recent surge of personal stories being told through the horror genre in films like \u201cIt Follows,\u201d \u201cThe Witch\u201d and \u201cThe Babadook,\u201d but there\u2019s an equally interesting trend in the science fiction genre as well. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen the genre used not only to examine the power of space travel or a post-apocalyptic future but as a way to address common humanity more than futuristic adventure stories. Joining films like \u201cGravity,\u201d \u201cInterstellar\u201d and \u201cThe Martian\u201d is Denis Villeneuve\u2019s ambitious and moving \u201cArrival,\u201d a movie that\u2019s about the day the universe changed forever but becomes more focused on a single story even as it\u2019s expanding its worldwide narrative. It is more about grief, time, communication and compassion than it is warp speed, and it\u2019s a film that asks questions. How do we approach that which terrifies us? Why is it important to communicate through language and not action? The final act of \u201cArrival\u201d gets to the big ideas of life that I won\u2019t spoil here, but viewers should know that Villeneuve\u2019s film is not the crowdpleaser of \"The Martian,\" Ridley Scott\u2019s big TIFF premiere last year. It\u2019s a movie designed to simultaneously challenge viewers, move them and get them talking. For the most part, it succeeds. Advertisement Amy Adams gives a confident, affecting performance as Louise, a linguistics expert brought in on the day that 12 unidentified flying objects enter Earth\u2019s orbit. Despite what they\u2019re telling the public\u2014which is not much of anything at first\u2014the governments of the world have made first contact with the creatures inside, beings that look vaguely like some higher power merged an octopus with a giant hand. Working with the military and a scientist named Ian (Jeremy Renner), Louise seeks to find the answer to a very simple question: What do you want? The Heptapods, as they\u2019re eventually called, speak in sounds that echo whale noises at times, but Louise quickly learns that written language is the way to communicate, even deciphering the complex way the interstellar tourists write. As she gets closer and closer to being able to convey that crucial question in a way that it (and its answer) will be understood, the world\u2019s uneasiness continues. Will man\u2019s protective instinct kick in before its science and language leaders can figure out a way to stop it? Louise also has darkness in her life. The opening scenes detail the birth, brief life and death of a child. Throughout, Adams imbues Louise with a quiet, effective emotional undercurrent that\u2019s essential to the film\u2019s success. This is a movie that gets too sterile at times, but Adams is always there to ground it. Villeneuve\u2019s vision is not particularly CGI-heavy, allowing Adams to work in a way that feels relatable. There\u2019s so much going on in this character\u2019s mind and heart, especially in the twisty final act, with which Adams could have \u201cgone big,\u201d but it\u2019s actually one of the more subtle and internal sci-fi movie performances that I\u2019ve ever seen. And it\u2019s a testament to the success of \u201cArrival\u201d that it\u2019s her face\u2014not the impressive alien ship/creature design\u2014that people will remember. As he has recently, Villeneuve understands the importance of surrounding himself with talented people. In this case, two of the film\u2019s undeniable MVPs are cinematographer Bradford Young, the genius who shot \u201cSelma\u201d and \u201cA Most Violent Year\u201d and composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson. The latter\u2019s compositions here are essential to every emotional beat of the film, defining the air of tension in the first half of the film and the moving undercurrents of the final act. Young\u2019s approach is beautifully tactile, using the natural world to make this unnatural story genuine. We may not be able to fully relate to Louise\u2019s narrative, but we can appreciate the image of a child running through a field. Young\u2019s imagery is fluid, unlike the choppy blockbuster cinematography that we\u2019re used to seeing in sci-fi. Most importantly, it feels like everything here is of one vision\u2014cinematography, direction, acting, score, etc.\u2014instead of the factory-produced blockbusters we\u2019ve seen of late. Advertisement Despite all of that, \u201cArrival\u201d sags a bit in the middle, a point when it may lose some viewers for good. The \u201cfirst contact\u201d act is undeniably confident and the final thematically purposeful scenes of the film are stunningly ambitious, but the pace of \u201cArrival\u201d softens a bit too much in the middle and one notices the sterility of the piece overall. Without spoiling anything, maintaining the shock value of the twists of the final act forces some narrative decisions in the mid-section that keep us observers to the action of the film when we\u2019re ready to be participants. Villeneuve is a talented director, but this movie lacks a degree of heat that would have helped it hit the emotional and philosophical beats of the final scenes. As is, we often feel like we\u2019re behind the barrier that Louise uses when communicating with the alien creatures she dubs Abbott and Costello. Like she wants to do, we so want to take off the equipment and get behind that screen.\u00a0 Having said that, this is ambitious, accomplished filmmaking that deserves an audience. It\u2019s a film that forces viewers to reconsider that which makes us truly human, and the impact of grief on that timeline of existence. At its best, and largely through Adams\u2019 performance, the film proposes that we\u2019ve all had those days in which communication breaks down and fear over the unknown sets in. And it is the best of us who persevere, get up from being knocked down and repair that which is broken.

{"Title": "Happy Valley", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "The location that gives \"Happy Valley\" its title is never meant \r\nto be bitterly ironic; it just turned out that way. The movie's \r\ndirector, Amir Bar-Lev (\"The Tillman Story,\" \"My Kid Could Paint That\"), \r\ndoesn't push the irony. He doesn't push anything, really. He just \r\nrecounts the whole sordid story of the Penn State football scandal \r\nagain, then draws, or tries to draw, some lessons from it.\u00a0 A\r\n few of the lessons we've already heard, and hopefully memorized, if we \r\ndidn't know them already. One is that sexual predators don't tend to \r\nlurk in dark alleyways like cartoon gargoyles, looking for children to \r\nkidnap; they're more likely to hide in plain sight, as the Penn State \r\nfootball program's assistant coach Jerry Sandusky did for so many years,\r\n setting himself up as a model citizen and surrogate father to \r\ngenerations of young men, the better to satisfy his compulsions. (There \r\nare many unsettling images in this film, but the TV news footage and \r\nstill photos of Sandusky's summer camp for boys ranks near the top.)\u00a0 Advertisement Another\r\n lesson is that when a crime is committed, an institution tends to view \r\nreporting it to proper authorities as a last resort. This was \r\ndemonstrated during the investigations into Sandusky's crimes by law \r\nenforcement and the National College Athletics Association. A trail of \r\nemails later revealed that the school's beloved football coach, Joe \r\nPaterno\u2014who reigned over the program for 46 years and died of cancer in \r\n2012, not long after the scandal broke\u2014reported Sandusky to the school \r\nas he was supposed to, then backpedaled and colluded with school \r\nadministrators to keep the abuse a secret so as not to jeopardize the \r\nteam's momentum, the community's pride or the school's finances and \r\nreputation.\u00a0 A third lesson is that when sports\r\n and community pride fuse, as they so often do in college sports-crazy \r\ncommunities, fans just absolutely, positively do not want to hear any \r\nbad news about their team, and tend to avoid it, deny it, minimize it, \r\nor verbally lawyer it away on technicalities. We see the latter \r\nhappening again when reporters\u2014or average citizens who accept that \r\nSandusky committed crimes and Paterno helped cover them up\u2014tell die-hard\r\n Penn State boosters that the school failed its athletes and therefore \r\ndeserves the abuse, scorn and penalties heaped on it, only to be met with \r\nsome variation of, \"Well, Paterno reported it, what more do you want?\" \r\nor \"Those crimes don't have anything to do with the great legacy of Penn\r\n State football.\"\u00a0 \"Happy Valley\" wades into \r\nmore problematic waters when it gets into the subject of guilt by \r\nassociation, and a community's related attempts to deal with scandal by \r\nsimply obliterating any trace of the people who initiated it. Much is \r\nmade here of whether the NCAA was right to take many seasons worth of \r\nPaterno's wins away from him, to send a message about the moral severity\r\n of the offense that he and his colleagues committed by participating in\r\n a cover-up. The program's partisans argue that Sandusky's crimes and \r\nthe program's complicity didn't necessarily contribute to the school's \r\nwon-lost record, and suggesting that they do only confuses the issues. \r\nThere are points where the director seems to be questioning the logic of\r\n that decision as well, even linking it subtly to the community's \r\nattempts to eradicate images and sculptures of Sandusky and Paterno from\r\n local buildings and streets.\u00a0 Advertisement Related to this \r\nis the sense that the entire community, which knew nothing of Sandusky's\r\n crimes or the university's role in hiding them, is being punished along\r\n with the conspirators, by having the Penn State football program taken \r\naway, the athletic records punitively altered, and the words \"Happy \r\nValley\" linked inextricably with sickness, cowardice and evil. What's \r\nthe community's crime, they wonder? Loving football too much?\u00a0 That's\r\n actually an excellent question, not nearly as loaded or defensive as it\r\n sounds. One could make the case that football is the United States of \r\nAmerica's one true religion, the thing that brings everyone together, if\r\n only for a few hours a week, and when a religion is threatened, \r\nthe faithful band together and refuse to listen to reason, and view any \r\nattempt to demand moral accountability from the exemplars of their faith\r\n as a form of blasphemy, or a collective assault.\u00a0 The movie \r\ninvites such comparisons by subtly (and sometimes unsubtly) likening \r\nAmerican football to religion, and its coaches, assistant coaches and \r\nadministrators to church officials entrusted with the care and guidance \r\nof young men. Echoes of the Roman \r\nCatholic Church's sexual abuse scandals are ever-present. When Happy \r\nValley residents discuss and argue the particulars of the Penn State \r\nscandal, you sometimes hear a catch in their voices, or see tears \r\nwelling in their eyes, because their values have been betrayed, or \r\nbecause their unshakable faith in the goodness of the program has opened\r\n them to ridicule and shame, and they know it.\u00a0 It's\r\n slightly frustrating that the movie doesn't venture a point-of-view on \r\nany of these larger issues, which are less clear cut than the matters of\r\n sexual abuse and its immediate enablers. But it's also understandable, \r\nbecause what could \"Happy Valley\" conclude, ultimately? Any summation \r\nmight have seemed glib or sanctimonious. We're left instead with \r\ntroubling questions that might not ever yield satisfying answers.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Proxy", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Zack Parker\u2019s \"Proxy\" opens with a scene so inherently shocking that \r\nit required a special warning in the program when the film played at the\r\n Toronto Film Festival for its \"deeply disturbing content.\" A quiet \r\nwoman named Esther (Alexia Rasmussen) is walking home from her final \r\nultrasound before giving birth. She\u2019s very pregnant, close to nine \r\nmonths. With no warning, a hooded attacker knocks her unconscious and \r\npounds her stomach with a brick, killing the baby. It is the kind of \r\nstomach-churning scene that sends those who just casually see whatever \r\nis playing at their local arthouse that weekend fleeing for the door. \r\n(Trust me, I used to work at such a theater and you would be amazed at \r\nthe number of people who just see whatever is playing.)  Advertisement And yet, while \r\nseasoned filmgoers expect what follows to be a procedural investigation \r\nor motive-detailing explanation of such a horrific event, Parker takes \r\nhis film somewhere else entirely. With the blunt force and social \r\ncontext of creators like Chuck Palahniuk (known in cinematic circles for\r\n \"Fight Club\" and \"Choke,\" but this piece is closer to his fiction like \r\n\"Survivor\" or the stories of \"Haunted\") and Lucky McKee (\"May\", \"The \r\nWoman\"), Parker has made a tough, brutal, and often riveting thriller. At first, it seems like Esther is understandably unmoored by the \r\nmurder of her unborn baby and that \"Proxy\" will be a dramatic piece \r\nabout unimaginable grief. She stares off into space, rides the bus to \r\nthe hospital in the middle of the night, and seems to have no human \r\nconnection at all. Then she meets Melanie (a truly great turn from Alexa\r\n Havins), a kind soul at a local support group. Melanie and Esther \r\nbecome quick friends, maybe even more, but there\u2019s something as \"off\" \r\nabout Melanie as there is in our heroine. Parker maintains an uneasy, \r\nunsettling tone even in this first act in the way that he crafts long, \r\nalmost intentionally clunky scenes of dialogue between his protagonists \r\nthat ooze with the tension of audience expectation. We\u2019ve seen a \r\npregnant woman attacked. What\u2019s next? And the flat, disaffected \r\nmannerisms of his stars add to the tension. Something is clearly wrong \r\nwith Esther. Something is clearly wrong with Melanie. Parker plays with \r\nour anticipation for these character reveals brilliantly. And then he drops the floor out from under us. More than once. To \r\ngive away where \"Proxy\" goes would be to spoil the unsettling appeal of a\r\n film that continuously foreshadows awful events to come but still \r\nsomehow ends up in unexpected places. Two significant others enter the \r\npicture in the form of Esther\u2019s girlfriend Anika (Kristina Klebe) and \r\nMelanie\u2019s husband Patrick (filmmaker Joe Swanberg). Minor roles are \r\nfilled out by performers who seem intentionally inexperienced, adding to\r\n the unease throughout the entire, admittedly long film. The amateurish \r\naspects of the production don\u2019t detract from it as much as give it an \r\neerie, lived-in quality that makes it harder to shake, not unlike some \r\nof the early works of David Cronenberg, another filmmaker who loved to \r\nplumb the horrific depths of everyday life. Parker writes very casual \r\ndialogue and doesn\u2019t fussily edit his film, allowing the horror to arise\r\n from or shatter the mundane. He can sometimes take a beat or two too \r\nlong and there\u2019s a probably tighter version of \"Proxy\" that\u2019s about 20 \r\nminutes shorter, but Parker still finds ways to sustain the unease. Advertisement There\u2019s a whole branch of thriller/horror literature and film that \r\nworks to keep those engaged with it guessing as to where it\u2019s going, but\r\n most of it seems random or haphazard in its structure. \"Proxy\" never \r\ndoes. It\u2019s a film that opens with the death of a baby and yet that isn\u2019t\r\n really even what it ends up being about (even if everything that \r\nfollows wouldn\u2019t without that incident). It\u2019s a film that I kept trying \r\nto get ahead of\u2014THIS is what it\u2019s \"about,\" where it\u2019s going, what the \r\ntitle means, etc.\u2014but Parker kept going left when I expected him to go \r\nright. It\u2019s a daring, confident, absolutely brutal film that takes no \r\nprisoners. It\u2019s the kind of film that will likely be loathsome to those \r\nmorally unwilling to not only accept its descent into darkness but also \r\naccept that the darkness that makes it so riveting is based on human \r\nneed.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Widowmaker", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "There's a reason why people say someone \"drops dead\" of a heart attack. How many times have we heard stories of a perfectly healthy individual, who doesn't smoke or drink, \"dropping dead\" in the driveway, on a treadmill, during a walk? Often people don't make it to the hospital, and die on the spot, as panicked loved ones call 911. \"The Widowmaker,\" Patrick Forbes' engrossing new documentary, tells the story of the often-contentious development of both preventionist and interventionist technology in the cardiology world over the last 60 years, highlighting the ongoing battles between insurance companies, the American Heart Association, groups of doctors, inventors, and financiers, all who have a vested sometimes-financial interest in their pet technology gaining the most traction. \"The Widowmaker\", narrated by Gillian Anderson, is a disheartening portrait of blatant greed, as well as a fascinating examination of the trial and error process used in the scientific method. It does what good documentaries should do: it shines a very focused light on a very specific problem, a problem that affects millions of people and their families. Advertisement \n According to the CDC, an estimated 610,000 people die annually of heart disease (that's 1 in 4 deaths), and an estimated 735,000 Americans die every year of a heart attack. Heart disease is the #1 killer in both men and women in this country. While there are definitely lifestyle adjustments one can make to lessen the chance of developing heart disease (exercise, diet, etc.), the disease does not discriminate. Perfectly healthy people also \"drop dead.\" The left coronary artery is known as the \"widowmaker\": if it malfunctions, sudden death can be the result. Forbes has woven through the documentary various personal stories from families who have lost a loved one, suddenly, from heart attacks. The stories are told simply, with old photographs and home-movie footage accompanying the narration, and the tone overall is one of confused loss. The person was healthy, the person played softball, the person was only 35 ... family members struggle to make sense of what happened. There are also interviews with people who have had heart attacks and survived (including Larry King who says that the pain is \"excruciatingly hard to explain.\") \n The development of various technologies to both prevent and stop heart attacks makes up the bulk of \"The Widowmaker,\" and fascinating stuff it is. We meet Julio Palmaz, a radiologist from Argentina, living outside San Francisco, who worked in his garage on a kind of mesh tube that could be inserted into arteries to hold them open. This would eventually be known as the \"stent,\" the most common interventionist technology used today to stop heart attacks. The problem with the stent is that the person needs to be in the hospital already, heart attack already in process, and, as shown repeatedly in the documentary, millions don't make it that far. What of the man struggling for breath in his driveway? He has minutes to live. Is there a way to prevent heart attacks before they arrive? Is there a way to predict a heart attack before it happens? This is where the development of the Coronary Calcium Scanning comes in, a process that checks for build-up of calcium in the arteries, a sure sign of the development of heart disease. The doctors involved in the Calcium Scanning technology became known as \"The Calcium Club,\" and they were marginalized and dismissed, for years, in favor of the Stent. \n Stents are paid for per procedure, and so hospitals love them, and overuse them, doctors got rich on their stent expertise, and prevention technology ended up being sidelined, in an official and unofficial manner. There's no money to be made in prevention. Forbes walks us through this extremely fraught and involved scientific landscape, where tempers still run high, with people sniping at one another in their interviews. One guy refers to the calcium scan proponents as a \"cult.\" Rene Oliveira, from the Texas House of Representatives who passed a bill in his state making calcium scans mandatory, said of one of the calcium-scan-naysayers, \"He's an idiot and probably still in dinosaur times in terms of his thinking,\" (A calcium scan saved Oliveira's life.) It is illuminating that the insurance companies mentioned in the film refused to participate in the documentary.\u00a0 Advertisement \n The battle over the years has been to make calcium scanning an accepted and regular part of a human being's health-care needs, similar to mammograms for women. The calcium scan is regularly referred to as \"a mammogram for the heart.\" But without an official stamp of approval from the AHA, and with pushback from the stent-happy doctors, it was an uphill battle. After ex-President Clinton's bypass in 2004, the White House declared that all future Presidents will have calcium scans. Better safe than sorry. NASA, too, after a scare with an astronaut thought to have had a cardiac event in space, implemented a mandatory calcium scan for all of their people. There are no stents in space, in other words. But the wider public had better hope they make it to the hospital in time.\u00a0 \n Forbes has so much material to cover, and much of it is highly technical. One could get lost in the amount of information. But he has fashioned \"The Widowmaker\" as a chronological tale, moving us through the years of developments, introducing us to the various figures, showing the set-backs and break-throughs, both political and scientific. While there are many \"talking heads\" here, Forbes has chosen to fill the film, front to back, with what amounts to second-unit shots, of various cities, San Francisco, New York, Miami, the places where these technologies were fostered. It is a constant collage of crosswalks, stoplights, skylines, foot traffic. It ends up being a very meaningful visual choice, showing the universality of the problem.\u00a0 \n Throughout \"The Widowmaker\", Forbes shows a furiously-counting ticker, clicking off the number of deaths per year from heart attacks, the number going up and up and up. The ticker provides a sense of urgency, the urgency we all know personally. Not one of us has been untouched by this disease. Packed full of diagrams and technology, scientific language and medical terms, \"The Widowmaker\" is welcoming, comprehensible and clear.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Dave Made a Maze", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "One thing needs to be cleared up right away. This movie is a quirky fantasy-adventure-comedy co-written and directed by Bill Watterson, in his behind-the-camera debut. Before you get all excited, it must be clarified: Not THAT Bill Watterson. The semi-reclusive \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d creator has not made his way to Los Angeles to pursue a new vision that only the cinema can contain. No, this Bill Watterson is a film and television actor in his early 40s, two conditions that do inform this movie\u2019s vision.  Advertisement The movie begins with video footage of the title character, who asks of the folks behind the camera interviewing him that they not make him look \u201cangry and spineless.\u201d Apparently this is the aftermath of Dave\u2019s project, an in-apartment maze (\u201clabyrinth\u201d is the more accurate term, Dave insists, and he has proof) that he made simply because, as he puts it, \u201cI wanted to make something.\u201d And apparently the thing he made has gotten a couple of people killed.  A title sequence shows Dave (Nick Thune) to be a creative type\u2014a to-do board on one wall of his place instructs him to \u201cFinish Concept Album.\u201d But what he does instead one afternoon is construct a cardboard castle in his living room. His girlfriend Annie (Meera Rohit Kumbhani) comes home and Dave instructs her not to enter the thing. It\u2019s bigger and deeper than she knows and he\u2019s stuck in it, trying to find a way out. He asks her to call his best friend Gordon (Adam Busch) for assistance.  When Gordon arrives, he and echoey Dave launch into a bit of struggling-Hollywood-bro banter, or at least that\u2019s what I assume it is. \u201cWhere\u2019s that beard at?\u201d Dave shouts. \u201cThe beard is on the face,\u201d Gordon responds. Gordon has a beard, you see. Anyway, running counter to Dave\u2019s directions, Annie has also invited all of Dave\u2019s friends over. They all look like they\u2019re headed for a Dan Zanes concert but forgot to bring the actual children for whom the concert is in fact intended. Among these folk is a camera crew\u2014these are the characters who interview Dave, not after the adventure but in the middle of it.  The all-live action section of this movie is lit and shot almost exactly like an episode of \u201cThe Adventures of Pete and Pete.\u201d That\u2019s not a bad thing in and of itself, but as relatively swinging as it was, \u201cThe Adventures of Pete and Pete\u201d was a children\u2019s show. Once the party turns into a rescue party, and Dave\u2019s pals all enter the labyrinth against his strident objections (the videographer yells \u201cDon\u2019t look at the camera,\u201d just like in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d ar ar ar), things get a little more visually interesting. Since the maze (labyrinth, sorry) is made of cardboard, the attendant visual effects, most of them in-camera, are deliberately low-tech and funky. There are gear-heavy booby traps. Characters are beheaded, or \u201cbeheaded,\u201d but when they are, streams of red wool thread shoot from their necks. There\u2019s a part of the labyrinth in which the characters transform into cardboard hand puppets. There\u2019s a section in which the characters turn to black and white. At this juncture, Annie forgets how mad she is at Dave long enough to join him and Gordon in doing bad impressions of Robert De Niro in \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d There\u2019s even a zoetrope. It\u2019s all very Hipster Etsy. Keeping things tense is a Minotaur, some guy the filmmakers probably picked up around Gold\u2019s Gym and put a cardboard horned head on. Advertisement I was wondering who exactly this movie was made for, and how I could avoid them, when in the middle of the picture Dave expels a cri de coeur, tied into the \u201cI wanted to make something\u201d riff. He says he hates the fact \u201cthat I still get money from my parents and I bore them,\u201d which is so on the money I almost felt bad for the guy. This feeling dissipated as this movie, a \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d for artisanal yogurt connoisseurs, ended, with a song called \u201cPinball,\u201d by the band Tandemoro. \u201cSippin\u2019 my beer/playin\u2019 pinball/yeah\u201d goes the chorus.

{"Title": "The Last Movie Star", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Adam Rifkin's \"The Last Movie Star\" is designed not just as a vehicle for Burt Reynolds, but as a meditation on Reynolds' fame. Using elements of Reynolds' actual biography, including footage from Reynolds' films, \"The Last Movie Star\" is the story of an actor who, despite his fame and good fortune, feels he never quite lived up to his potential. Maybe he could have had a more \"serious\" career if he had taken some risks. This is Rifkin's point of view, too. \"The Last Movie Star\" thrums with Rifkin's urgency, similar to Linda Loman's comment at the end of \"Death of a Salesman\": \"Attention must be paid.\" (Some of us never stopped paying attention to Reynolds, but never mind.) As a commentary on Reynolds' career trajectory, \"The Last Movie Star\" is hit-or-miss. What is undeniable, though, is the space Rifkin has created where Reynolds can do what Reynolds does best, and if you're a fan (as I am) there's much here to treasure. Advertisement When Vic Edwards (Burt Reynolds), a 1970s-era movie star who now lives a quiet lonely life as an old man, arrives at the \"International Nashville Film Festival\" to accept a Lifetime Achievement Award, he is chagrined (and furious) to discover that the fest was thrown together by a trio of 20-something film geeks, and hosted in the back of a bar. His \"personal driver\" is a loud-mouthed Goth girl named Lil (Ariel Winter), who has no idea who Vic is, and doesn't care. To Vic, the low-rent festival seems a commentary on his career failures. On opening night, with a small crowd of eager movie fans in attendance, he gets wasted and lashes out during the QA session. Reynolds doesn't soft-pedal any of this. Vic is a jerk. Vic demands Lil take him to the airport immediately, but on their way there, he asks her to detour to Knoxville, his birthplace. So begins Vic's journey down memory lane, with Lil in tow, who spends most of her time arguing with her abusive boyfriend on the phone. Vic visits the small house where he grew up. He visits the football stadium where he was a champion. Slowly, over the course of the road trip, Lil softens up, Vic gives her fatherly advice, while making peace with unfinished business in his past. In a couple of sequences, Rifkin puts current-day Reynolds into footage from Reynolds' actual films, with dialogue molded to fit. So Vic sits in the passenger seat of the car in \"Smokey and the Bandit,\" urging his wild younger self to take life a little bit more seriously. Or he lies in the canoe in \"Deliverance,\" watching his younger self shoot fish with a crossbow. There's an eloquent moment where Vic really takes in the biceps, the sexy forehead-wrinkle of his younger self, and comments, almost startled, \"Damn, you're good-lookin'.\" It's not a moment of vanity. It's like saying, \"The Grand Canyon is big.\" Advertisement I liked these meta-moments. (Rifkin even throws in a reference to Reynolds' famous nude spread in\u00a0Cosmopolitan.) I liked them because they gave Reynolds an opportunity to reflect, in a way he has rarely been asked to do. He's an old man. He's trying to make sense of his life. Rifkin using Reynolds' actual life as fodder for the film results in electric moments like Vic staring at the empty football stadium, and saying, \"It's fun being a movie star, but nothing compares to being a football star. Nothing.\" Reynolds doesn't need to \"act\" that line. He knows it in his bones. Reynolds, in his heyday, had an effortlessly masculine charm and a goofball sense of humor. If that killer combo could be bottled, it would be worth millions. But it can't be bottled, an actor just has to have\u00a0it. Burt Reynolds had it. He became a star after years in Hollywood as a stuntman and a bit player in B-Westerns and television series. He was likable, gorgeous, and charming. A gorgeous man who doesn't take himself seriously (or at least appears\u00a0to not take himself seriously), who lampoons his own stardom, who doesn't strain for the brass ring of respectability (and Oscars), who is happy \"just\" entertaining his fans ...\u00a0this was the magic elixir of Reynolds. He was one of the best Johnny Carson guests ever. He didn't come on to plug his projects, or if he did, the \"plug\" soon went out the window because he was too busy shaving off one side of his mustache or squirting whipped cream into Carson's crotch (a clip Rifkin uses in \"Last Movie Star\"). Reynolds was what he was, and he was the biggest sex symbol of his day doing it. The question \"The Last Movie Star\" seems to pose is: Would Reynolds' career have been better if he had taken on grittier parts?\u00a0I don't think so, not necessarily. Reynolds acted from pure natural charisma, something unique to him. It won't win Oscars, but Oscars do not equal actual worth. If you think being \"charming\" is easy, then walk into a party where you don't know anyone and try to be as charming as Reynolds. He committed the \u201ccrime\u201d of making it all look easy. Burt Reynolds did a Turner Classic Movie tribute video for Spencer Tracy, his favorite actor. He met Tracy in 1959 while working on a television series. Tracy was filming \"Inherit the Wind\" on a nearby soundstage, and Reynolds would sneak over every day just to watch Tracy work. One day, the two struck up a conversation. Reynolds recalls, \"I told him that I was trying to be an actor and Mr. Tracy said, 'Well, don't let anybody catch you at it. Don't act. Just behave.' I felt like I was being knighted. That advice was so true.\" It was advice Reynolds clearly took to heart. Whether doing a playful sexy duet with Dolly Parton in \"Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" or romancing Jill Clayburgh in \"Starting Over\" or whooping it up with Jerry Reed in \"Smokey and the Bandit,\" Reynolds was at home in his own skin. In \"Deliverance,\" he is a natural Alpha male, without huffing or puffing with effort. He was terrific in \"Semi-Tough,\" \"Best Friends,\" \"The Longest Yard,\" films suited to his sensibility. Robert De Niro gaining a lot of weight for \"Raging Bull\" has become a measuring-stick for what good acting should look like, but there are many ways to have a career, and Reynolds' career was a throwback to an earlier type of fame, fame based on personality or essence. \"Boogie Nights,\" of course, gave him the chance to step into a\u2014pater familias\u2014space, while still utilizing his powerful sexual persona, bringing with him the \"hangover\" of his 1970s-era superstardom. Advertisement The hangover is still present in \"The Last Movie Star,\" something Rifkin relies on. I may disagree with Rifkin's take on what \"went wrong\" in Reynolds' career, but Reynolds himself seems to have misgivings about his choices along the way. Rifkin has given Reynolds opportunity to let us see what it's like to be him, and Reynolds does so without strain, without pleading for sympathy, just an exhausted acknowledgement of his own truths. His quiet monologue where he \"says goodbye\" to Knoxville is so beautifully clear and true it seems \"captured\" rather than \"performed.\" Reynolds holds the center of \"The Last Movie Star.\" He lets us see aspects of himself left out of the kinds of roles he normally played, aspects like insecurity, thoughtfulness, regret, grief, helplessness. If you want to know why Reynolds is great, watch him when he's listening to someone talk. There's one scene in the car where Lil, at the wheel, rattles off her lengthy and byzantine pharmacological history. Rifkin places the camera on the driver's side of the car, with Lil in the foreground and Vic in the passenger seat. Rifkin never cuts. The monologue goes on forever,\u00a0and your eye keeps going to Reynolds' face, listening to her talk. In his listening, Reynolds doesn't \"comment\" on what he hears. He doesn't telegraph to us his reaction to the drug-cocktails. He is in the moment. Total focus on her. When she finally finishes, there's a slight pause, and he says, calmly, still looking at her, \"Should you be driving?\" That's Burt Reynolds.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Safelight", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "Bad movies are common. Shockingly bad movies, ones that are\r\nso incompetently conceived and executed as to force one to question how they\r\ngot made, are less so, despite what Angry Film Twitter might have you believe. \u201cSafelight\u201d\r\nis a jaw-droppingly bad movie, a film that doesn\u2019t have characters or a plot.\r\nIt has mouthpieces who speak in platitudes and clich\u00e9s, pushing forward through\r\na predictable, depressing narrative that sounds like a flunked high school\r\nstudent\u2019s attempt at creative fiction. To write off \u201cSafelight\u201d as just another\r\ngeneric romantic teen drama about wounded souls who find healing in each other\u2019s\r\narms wouldn\u2019t do justice to its baffling ineptitude.  Advertisement \u201cSafelight\u201d is about the shy, crippled boy and the hooker\r\nwith the heart of gold who change each other\u2019s lives. If you\u2019re asking\r\nyourself, \u201cDo they still make that movie?,\u201d \u201cSafelight\u201d is here with an answer.\r\nEvan Peters (\u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d) stars as Charles, a bullied 17-year-old\r\nwho works at a truck stop with a wisecracking Christine Lahti and, from the\r\nlooks of it, no actual truckers. Charles is drawn to the lone hooker who works\r\nthis lonely locale, Vicki (Juno Temple), an 18-year-old with a violent pimp\r\nnamed Skid (Kevin Alejandro). Apparently when they were handing out tough pimp\r\nnames, he was absent. Charles' mom left when he was a baby. Charles\u2019 dad is dying. Charles\u2019 brother is dead. Charles\r\nwants to take photographs of the California lighthouses, something his sibling\r\nwas going to do before he died. \u201cHe\r\nreally liked the idea of light guiding people home.\u201d Yes, \u201cSafelight\u201d is\r\none of those films in which every conversation and every action must play into\r\nthe arc of the healing-romantic-drama. Nothing registers as genuine. Peters and\r\nTemple have zero chemistry and writer/director Tony Aloupis doesn\u2019t even seem\r\ninterested in their romance, ignoring the sexual undercurrents that could have\r\nformed a coming-of-age story for Charles and even dismissing the idea that Vicki\r\ncould have found real love instead of the paying kind. He's too busy talking about lighthouses. Every opportunity for\r\nreal dramatic stakes in \u201cSafelight\u201d seems to have been considered and then\r\nignored. And as Charles and Vicki get closer, \u201cSafelight\u201d gets less and less\r\ngenuine. They\u2019re all caricatures, from the pimp who cackles like a maniac to\r\nthe dying father with the sage advice for his shy son. Caricatures are bad enough, but even the tropes are poorly\r\nexecuted here. The dialogue is forced, stilted and unnatural. At times, it\u2019s\r\nhard to believe performers like Temple and Peters, who generally make smart\r\ndecisions, could force this dialogue out of their mouths given the weird\r\nrhythms of the piece. Imagine reading greeting cards in a dramatic scene. It\r\nwouldn\u2019t sound right coming out of your mouth. The cadence of normal speaking\r\npatterns isn\u2019t even here.  Like the pictures that Charles takes of lighthouses, we\u2019ve\r\nseen \u201cSafelight\u201d before. And it was pretty boring then too. Charles actually\r\nsays about his photography and people in general, \u201cIf you look at it long enough, you get to see what it\u2019s really showing\r\nyou.\u201d \u201cSafelight\u201d illuminates nothing.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Song to Song", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "I'm in the tank for Terrence Malick. I don't believe that the Austin-based director has ever made a bad movie, just ones that were too fragmented, mysterious and intuitive to connect with a wide audience. I thought \"Knight of Cups\" was one of last year\u2019s most daring features, but I realize this is a minority opinion. Mention the director to a movie buff these days and you\u2019re likely to get jokes about voice-overs and perfume ads and twirling in fields, plus complaints that Malick is too much of this and not enough of that, and not what he used to be.  Advertisement I don't care. I love that after 44 years of feature filmmaking, his style is still an issue. Even at its most obtuse, Malick\u2019s work never plays by commercial cinema's rules, coming at characterization and story from odd angles when it isn\u2019t chasing the ineffable, as his camera chased a butterfly in \u201cThe Tree of Life.\u201d The actor and filmmaker Tim Blake Nelson, who had a small role in Malick's epic 1998 war poem \"The Thin Red Line,\" said the difference between Malick and most other filmmakers is \"the difference between [Georges] Seurat painting with dots and [Paul] Cezanne, who's a more painterly painter.\"\u00a0  Nevertheless, here we are, at long last: \u201cSong to Song,\u201d a romantic drama set against the backdrop of the Austin pop scene, is the first Malick film I\u2019ve watched where the dots never came together to form a legible image.  Rooney Mara plays a woman in love with two men, a musician played by Ryan Gosling and a producer played by Michael Fassbender. Natalie Portman plays a waitress who has an affair with Fassbender. I\u2019m not entirely sure who Cate Blanchett is supposed to be, but she gets involved with Ryan Gosling at one point. All of the characters have issues with their parents: Portman\u2019s mom, played by Holly Hunter, sacrificed everything for her after their father left or died, I\u2019m not sure which. Gosling takes care of his terminally ill father (Neely Bingham) and has a flirtatious relationship with his mother (Linda Emond), who stares at him the way a person on the street might stare at Ryan Gosling.  I\u2019m referring to the actors by their real names throughout this review because it scarcely matters what their characters are named. Like \u201cTo the Wonder\u201d and \u201cKnight of Cups,\u201d the two other Malick films set in the present, \u201cSong to Song\u201d feels improvised\u2014so much so that for stretches you may feel as if you\u2019re watching a documentary about Terrence Malick trying to devise a film on the fly.  The title obliquely refers to the \u201cSong of Songs,\u201d the last section of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible and also the fifth book of Wisdom in the Old Testament. It is often described as a celebration of physical love between women and men. The movie invites that association with its many images of gorgeous people kissing, caressing, touching each other\u2019s hips and bellies, nuzzling near sunlit windows, and lounging on beds and in parks. And twirling. The architecture of civilization and nature enfolds the actors as they glide through Malick\u2019s frames. There are close-ups of feet traversing hardwood floors and the damp stone edges of swimming pools (these are often the type that seem to cut off at the edge of a cliff or hillside). Like the superior \"Knight of Cups,\" this is a warmer cousin of the cosmic-minded bourgeois dramas that Michelangelo Antonioni (\"La Notte\") used to make 50 years ago.  Advertisement We get a sense, as in most Malick films, of civilization holding nature at bay, or falsely believing that\u2019s what it\u2019s doing. Leaves fall, flowers wave, pollen swirls in the air, the sun peeks through treetops, but we also hear jet engines and car horns, amplified music and feedback. Flocks of bats whirl in the air near the Congress Street Bridge in downtown Austin. Dogs snuggle with their owners. Deer explore suburban lawns. Gosling takes a break from tending to his dad, goes outside, and feeds a horse an apple while interstate traffic rumbles through the background. One of the film\u2019s modernist houses is built around an old, tall tree that rises through a skylight. The whole film could be a premonition of Pocahontas, the heroine of \u201cThe New World,\u201d after moving to England.  Spectacle and sensation are all. Live songs start a few bars in and end a half-minute later. Classical score music, narration and dialogue compete with them, creating a cacophony that is sometimes pleasurable, sometimes grating. Malick and his regular cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, capture concert scenes in outdoor venues with thousands of people, and intimate scenes in gorgeously decorated homes where characters practice songs or noodle on a piano or guitar. The actors are filmed as if they were dancers performing without the aid of a choreographer. Women pirouette and skip like little girls. Men mock-battle each other over a woman or roughhouse in the grass like little boys. Fassbender imitates an angry ape and makes Gosling laugh so hard he falls over. Such bits could be a statement about the eternal child inside every adult or they might be examples of what actors do when they aren\u2019t sure what they\u2019re supposed to do. This was not a distinction that mattered much in other Malick films, even recent, maligned ones, but it matters here because the movie is so entropic. Malick\u2019s cast features many famous musicians, including Iggy Pop, whose chest and abs draw stares of amazement from Lubezki\u2019s camera, and Patti Smith, who talks about her husband Fred\u2019s 1994 death from a heart attack with such insight that you may wish you were watching a documentary about her instead. An uncredited Val Kilmer appears in a concert sequence, plunging a chainsaw into an amplifier and telling the crowd, \u201cI got some uranium \u2026 I bought it off my mom!\u201d About halfway through, Fassbender starts turning into his character from \u201cShame.\u201d Mara and Gosling never turn into anything. The hint of a roiling interior life that Blanchett manages to give her character feels more anchored than anything else in the movie, except for a tight close-up of Gosling contemplating his father\u2019s mortality and a scene of Mara arguing with her dad in a gas station parking lot. Advertisement At one point Malick gives us a 30-second snippet of a twerking contest. That is not a sentence I ever expected to type. The most affecting moments in \"Song to Song\" are close-ups of people crying while they remember mistakes and wallow in regret. These moments would be devastating if there were ... well, not a story, exactly\u2014like Jean-Luc Godard, Malick doesn\u2019t need a story to do his thing\u2014but perhaps a clearer personal context and a bit of rhetorical connective tissue linking it to the movie\u2019s grand themes (grief and loss, compromise and corruption, the anesthetizing superficiality of modern existence).  \u201cSong to Song\u201d is disjointed even by the standards of a Malick film with a title that announces \u201cthis is a collection of bits.\u201d Huge developments in the characters\u2019 lives come out of nowhere (often after being heralded by awkward bits of voice-over) then are never mentioned again. There\u2019s a raw, loud confrontation scene where Gosling accuses Fassbender of cheating him, but a couple of scenes later things seem OK between them. A major character appears to die, causing a family member to collapse in grief, but the event is presented so fuzzily that it takes a few minutes to be sure that the character is dead. The results were hit and miss in Malick\u2019s other contemporary dramas, too, but you always felt as if there was a method to the madness. Malick presided over accidents as if he were a God who had conjured them through mischief and prayer. There was a grave sincerity to the films' presentations of guilt, nostalgia, longing and spiritual crisis, and a smiling confidence to the way Lubezki\u2019s camera circled the actors while they flirted, brooded and frolicked. But in \u201cSong to Song\u201d there are times when the storytelling might remind you instead of a book report by a student who wants you to think he read the book cover to cover when he actually just skimmed the dust jacket five minutes ago. It doesn\u2019t help that Gosling and his siblings\u2019 resentment of their dad, the central love triangle and other elements are all rehashed from recent Malick films.  Advertisement When a poet fails, it\u2019s not always easy to put your finger on why, because the failures are created through the same elusive, interior process as the triumphs. I wouldn't presume to guess exactly what went wrong here. Malick is employing the same audiovisual vocabulary as in his previous three films (with a few refinements, including the widspread use of tiny GoPro cameras), and he\u2019s dealing with a lot of tried-and-true Malickian themes and situations. But no matter how warmly you feel towards Malick, the film still doesn\u2019t click as it should. It's a brainy concept album made up of B-sides and filler. The musicianship is superb but the songs needed work.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Day of the Dead: Bloodline", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "I was at Montreal\u2019s wonderful genre festival, Fantasia, last year when I heard that George A. Romero had passed away and I honestly felt my knees a buckle a little bit. Very few filmmakers have influenced me as greatly as the king of the zombies, the man who redefined horror in a way that\u2019s still resonating today. I\u2019m kind of a zombie movie nut, willing to watch even the most negligible title (although, somewhat tellingly, I mostly gave up on the tedium of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d a few years ago). And so when \u201cDay of the Dead: Bloodline,\u201d a promised retelling of one of Romero\u2019s classic \u201cDead\u201d films came across my radar, I thought, \u201cThat might be a fun way to start the new year.\u201d It\u2019s not. Advertisement \u201cDay of the Dead: Bloodline\u201d feels like one of those zombie flicks that was slightly tweaked here and there to resemble the 1985 Romero film but could have started life as any sort of flick featuring brain-eaters. The shared DNA with Romero\u2019s flick is in two key aspects of this new work\u2014the setting of a remote military-run complex after the world has been overrun by the undead and a 'Bub' character who seems a little different than your run-of-the-mill zombie. However, the social commentary that coursed underneath \u201cDay of the Dead\u201d is largely lacking here. While Romero\u2019s film felt like it had something to say about control and the government (even if Roger notoriously didn\u2019t think it succeeded in saying it), \u201cBloodline\u201d can\u2019t figure out its message, and the characters are nowhere near interesting enough to overcome the muddled themes of the film.    \u201cBloodline\u201d sets its tone with a hyperactive opening scene that attempts to capture the end of the world. A woman, who we will learn is a medical professional named Zoe (Sophie Skelton), shuffles her way down a street as the zombie apocalypse unfolds around her. Instantly, it\u2019s clear that these are more \u201cBoyle Zombies,\u201d the runners from the \u201c28 Days Later\u201d films than the plodders from Romero\u2019s works. They even have the hand-eye coordination to snatch people off moving bicycles and crash car windows. The world has gone mad.    Cut to \u201cFour Hours Earlier,\u201d where we learn more about Zoe, who is working at a hospital when hell breaks loose. The flashback is mostly designed to introduce us to Max (Jonathan Schaech), a creepy patient of Zoe\u2019s who not only has something unique about his blood but is obsessed with our heroine. How obsessed? Carved-her-name-in-his-arm obsessed. During a party at the facility, Max tries to rape Zoe, only to have a corpse the doctors were examining spring to life and attack him. Suddenly, the office party is going very badly. At least one can say that \u201cDay of the Dead: Bloodline\u201d wastes no time getting to spurting jugulars, consumed intestines, and puking blood.    Advertisement Cut to five years later, as Zoe is a doctor at a refugee camp, where she works on \u2018rotters\u2019 and takes care of the humans who live there, including a high military presence. Of course, she has to go out to find meds for a sick kid, which leads her convoy back to the hospital from the opening scenes. Guess who\u2019s still there? Before you know it, zombie Max has returned to the camp with Zoe and the midsection of \u201cBloodline\u201d plays out like a weird riff on slasher pics. It\u2019s like \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d with Jason replaced by a zombie and Camp Crystal Lake a refugee camp. There are even slasher pic set-ups like \u201cHey, go check on the maintenance guy who didn\u2019t show up to do his job,\u201d and Max acts like a serial killer in the way he stalks his prey. It\u2019s not long before Zoe realizes that Max is valuable\u2014her sociopath rapist could be their savior. Ewww.\u00a0 There are a few well-choreographed action scenes and the makeup work here is actually pretty strong, especially on Max, who seems like a character whose design was influenced by Tom Savini\u2019s breakthrough accomplishments in the first \u201cDay,\u201d and not just in the way he kind of becomes this movie\u2019s \u2018Bub.\u2019 The biggest problem with \u201cBloodline\u201d is that Zoe is just a dull character, both on the page and as performed. So it\u2019s a film that\u2019s ostensibly about objectifying and possessing women that features a personality-less object as the protagonist, thereby creating a black hole at the center of the film. By the time the movie reaches its noisy climax, I think I felt like Roger did about the original movie\u2014that I was just watching people I didn\u2019t care about yell at each other and make really stupid decisions. If you agree with his review, this is actually a pretty loyal remake.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Lemon", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The dictionary definition of \"quirky\" is \"characterized by peculiar or unexpected traits.\" But how\u00a0is something \"peculiar\" or \"unexpected\"? Mid-to low-budget indie films are described as \"quirky\" so often that the term has lost any specific resonance. Better to be called \"quirky\" than \"predictable,\" I suppose, but at a certain point, \"quirkiness\" becomes just as generic as the actually generic. \"Lemon,\" a comedy directed by Janicza Bravo (with a number of short films and television episodes under her belt), and co-written by Bravo and husband Brett Gelman (who also stars in the film), has some legitimately peculiar traits, and moments that flash with true absurdity. But there's a flatness in the end-result. The quirky is utterly predictable. Advertisement Actor/acting teacher Isaac (Brett Gelman) goes through the motions of his life like a grumpy automaton. He is married to a busy career woman who also happens to be blind (Judy Greer), but the two are mainly estranged. Once upon a time, he must have been an actor of some sort (although it's very hard to picture), but now he is barely holding on. He gets a gig, but it's a commercial for adult diapers. The man lives in a constant state of humiliation and barely controlled rage. He takes out his humiliation on the students in his acting class. The acting class sequences are, far and away, the best parts of the film. Bravo knows her stuff when it comes to acting classes. She films them at peak high drama: the black box studio, the spot-lit students working in front of the class, the tense silence as everyone waits to hear what Isaac will say. \"Lemon\" understands what it's like when a teacher has a clear \"favorite,\" the one student who can do no wrong. \"Lemon\" also understands how disorienting it is for the \"favorite\" when the teacher moves his attention on to another student. Egos get increasingly fragile the more they are over-praised. \"Lemon\" also understands how a failed-actor teacher secretly resents the young students in his care, and subtly tries to sabotage their confidence in themselves. These are all very subtle inter-dynamics, familiar to anyone who has taken an acting class, and Bravo and Gelman get all of those details right. The two students caught up in the web of Isaac's failed-actor dysfunction are the insufferable Alex (Michael Cera, with an Art Garfunkel mop of curls) and the beleaguered Tracy (Gillian Jacobs), shown throughout working on the famous scene in The Seagull\u00a0when Nina and Konstantin reunite after Nina's time away. According to Isaac, Alex can do wrong, and Tracy can do no right. Alex says stuff like, \"I've been using colors in my exploring\" and Isaac nods in rapture as though it's the Pythagorean Theorem made manifest. Isaac and Alex gang up on poor Tracy and you want to tell her to find another class pronto. In these scenes, Bravo finds exactly the right tone: they are funny, observant, and hugely insightful about a very specific sub-culture (acting classes and the emotional melodramas therein). Advertisement The rest of \"Lemon\" struggles under the weight of its imposed tone, which is mannered, flat-affect, deadpan, ultimately oppressive, punctuated by ranks of eccentric characters, and all accompanied in heavy-handed fashion in almost every scene by a score from Heather Christian. How would the film would play without the over-reliance on the music? Isaac's life shifts, as much as it is able to shift, once he meets Cleo (Nia Long). She is a makeup artist and single mother, and he becomes instantly obsessed with her after meeting her on a photo shoot for his commercial. His obsession is understandable since Nia Long is a beautiful actress and naturally charming (almost a lost art). In her career, whether it's the television series \"Empire,\" or \"Dear White People,\" or the Tyler Perry film \"The Single Moms Club,\" Long brings depth of feeling to whatever she does. Why Cleo would be interested in a \"Gloomy Gus\" such as Isaac is a mystery, but Long makes it work because she's that's kind of actress. \"Lemon\" has moments where it lampoons the casual racism in the white world (when Long reveals she has a son, Isaac replies, \"My sister has a black son\"), as well as Isaac's fish-out-of-water attitude when he meets her family, but these potent elements never rise fully to the surface. Isaac comes from a raucous Jewish family, where the parents (Rhea Perlman and Fred Melamed) crowd the family around the piano to sing 10 choruses of \"One Million Matzo Balls.\" The family scenes present a murderer's row of weirdos: the checked-out sister-in-law who never speaks, the pregnant lesbian sister, the nervous-breakdown-prone family psychiatrist, the terrifying-looking twin girls in matching plaid dresses, etc. By the time this family shows up, though, \"Lemon\" is pretty much quirk-ed out. \"Lemon\" doesn't seem to understand that it has a really interesting story woven into its fabric already: the love-hate relationship an acting teacher has with his favorite student, a student who clearly needs the praise like water needs sunlight and who falls apart once that praise is taken away. Bravo and Gelman nail those scenes. They have a disturbing clarity and focus, distinct from the rest of the film. They are accurate, brutal, and very funny. It's all there.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The World's End", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "You might not expect a slapstick comedy about middle-aged pubcrawlers brawling with superhuman extraterrestrial invaders to have brains, heart and wisdom, but that's \"The World's End,\" a rare film that's as much fun as you've heard.\u00a0 Directed by Edgar Wright from a script by him and his regular leading man, Simon Pegg, the film is refreshingly intimate, despite the chasing and stalking and beheading and exploding and gallons of blue goop spraying all over everything. The special effects are special, but they always serve the story and characters. And even when Wright is paying homage to his filmmaking heroes (John Carpenter especially) or staging some of the most cleverly choreographed fights this side of an early '90s Jackie Chan film, you never get the sense that it's bored with itself when the characters \u00a0are sitting around talking about their shared history over a pint. In fact, they often talk about their shared histories while they're whaling on the invaders\u2014and then they have a pint. Sometimes they have a pint during the fight. It's that kind of movie. Advertisement Pegg's character, Gary King, wants people to call him The King and considers himself a prince among men, but he's the sort of guy you'd tire of quickly. His friends had enough of him long ago. They tell themselves they've grown up; Gary thinks they've sold out and become tediously conventional. To the film's credit, neither of these points-of-view are presented as entirely wrong.\u00a0 Oliver (Martin Freeman) is a fussy killjoy of a real estate agent with a Bluetooth receiver jammed in his ear at all times.\u00a0Steven (Paddy Considine), an architect who was once Gary's rival for the affections of\u00a0Oliver's sister Sam\u00a0(Rosamund Pike), is recently divorced and sleeping with a young fitness instructor; he brags about that last bit to everyone who'll listen, which is how you know he's miserable about the rest of his life. Peter (Eddie Marsan) who was horribly bullied as a child, was always the tagalong nerd of the old group; now he sells cars for his dad. \u00a0Andrew (Nick Frost) is a lawyer who refuses to speak to\u2014or of\u2014Gary. Gary says it's because he still owes Andrew six hundred pounds from long ago, but we deduce that the real reason for the split is much deeper. It is. In fact it's a doozy. The first part of the movie consists of Gary \"getting the old band back together,\" as he puts it, to re-enact their great thwarted pub odyssey from 1990, when they resolved to hit all twelve nightspots in their old hometown of\u00a0Newton Haven. The quiet little town is home to bars with mythologically and otherwise suggestively loaded names: The Two-Headed Dog, The Famous Cock, The Trusty Servant, The World's End. That the pals didn't finish their quest has always gnawed at Gary. He's obsessed with pinning a triumphant end on a long-unfinished story. Running beneath the lively banter and knockabout slapstick is a sense of melancholy, at times despair, over lost youth and missed opportunities. Gary is an alcoholic and drug user and chronic screwup, the sort of guy who lures other lads into joining adventures that tend to end in humiliation or disaster. He's first seen in a rehab facility, but judging from his appearance and behavior he hasn't been there long. Pegg looks like just crawled out of bed\u2014a bed at the bottom of a mine shaft, most likely\u2014and even his most jocular pronouncements have an undertone of manic desperation. \"Why should getting older affect something as important as friendship?\" he demands, a question thick with unexamined assumptions.\u00a0 Advertisement If \"The World's End\" were only a picture about childhood buddies on a bittersweet pub crawl, it might have still been some sort of minor classic, so sharply observed is every shot, cut, music cue, line and close-up. When the film takes a right turn into science fiction conspiracy thriller territory\u2014invoking \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" as well as such Carpenter films as \"The Fog\" and \"Prince of Darkness\"\u2014you might worry that it's about to succumb to Gary's biggest fear, and trade spiky if heedless individuality for a tiresome grab at commercial formula. (This is the third Wright film in which a dull community proves a hotbed of slowly-creeping and highly secretive horror.) No worries: the sci-fi elements\u2014which were hinted at in trailers, but which I'll write around in this review and maybe revisit later in a spoiler-warning-bedecked blog post\u2014are audaciously funny and inventively designed, and they're always tied to the film's concerns. Nothing, no matter how extravagant or surreal, is superfluous. Fears of assimilation and domestication and the loss of youthful fire are never far from the movie's mind; neither is the altogether wise and reasonable sense that, while we should strive to be better, kinder, more mature people, we still are who we are, and if we cannot tolerate one another's frailties and treat each other decently, there's no hope for the species. The film has great fun painting modern life itself as a prolonged and largely invisible conspiracy to rob people and their world of all personality. Every old pub the boys revisit has been Starbucked, as they put it, and later we get the sense that the very same digitally connected world that lets you read this review on a tiny handheld computer-phone is a means of social control as well.\u00a0Odd as it might sound, the unexpectedly laid back climax echoes \"A Clockwork Orange.\" It conveys a sense that, while a totally safe and placid and perfect world might be attainable, it's not desirable, and might in fact be a greater sin than any act that any individual might commit.\u00a0 Wright is a brilliant director of turbocharged exposition, elegant but bruising action sequences, and graphically bold comedic overkill. As in \"Shaun of the Dead,\" \"Hot Fuzz\" and \"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World,\" even functional closeups of beer being poured or ignition keys being turned are shot as if they were events on par with the Big Bang or the release of a new Kanye West album.\u00a0Wright is a pop artist who's not inclined to relax; at times his movies play as if he'd decided to turn the first five minutes of \"Trainspotting\" into a career. There are times when I wished the \"The World's End\" had the confidence to linger more on the characters' conversations and nonverbal interactions. The group's chemistry evokes the best sad-sack male bonding tales of Barry Levinson (\"Diner,\" \"Tin Men\"), and the performances are all superb, particularly Frost, who steals the film with an explosive physicality that's John Goodmanesque. Advertisement But in an era in which mainstream movies not only lack rhythm but seem to have forgotten how to dance, this one's briskness is inspiring. Its judgment is nearly unerring, and it has a sense of joy that's rare.\u00a0Like most genre films, \"The World's End\" is working things through in an extremely broad way and having a grand time doing it, and its self-deprecating wit inoculates it against self-importance. The movie wears its themes on its sleeve and pins its symbols to its puffed-out rooster's chest, swaggers about with a proud grin jabbing thumbs at itself, then walks into an open manhole. It's magnificent.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues\" finds Will Ferrell's vain news reader Ron Burgundy trying to re-create himself at a CNN-type network in the eighties, and accidentally inventing the soul-sucking brand of non-news that now rules cable. It's a pretty good joke, one that you might even call \"satirical,\" but it's not sustained; the movie keeps forgetting about it, just as it keeps forgetting about Ron's desire to reunited with estranged wife Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) and their ickily sweet son Walter (who's named for Walter Cronkite and played by Judah Nelson).\u00a0Nothing in \"Anchorman 2\" is sustained, really. As directed by Adam McKay, who helmed the original, it's a slapped-together movie\u2014more so than most movies by former \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, more so than most Will Ferrell films, and certainly more so than the original 2004 \"Anchorman,\" a bunch of heavily improvised bits that nevertheless seemed to be going somewhere because they were woven around the story of Ron and Veronica's romance and professional rivalry.\u00a0 Advertisement The couple's bond falls apart in this film's opening sequence, which finds the duo anchoring a weekend broadcast at a New York-based network in 1980. Their boss (Harrison Ford, amusingly menacing) tells them he's retiring and that Veronica will replace him, becoming the first female anchor in the company's history. Ron is fired for being the worst anchor anyone has ever seen, leaves Veronica rather than live in her shadow, then endures a period of mourning before returning to New York to join a 24-hour network modeled on both CNN (the format) and Fox News (tabloid mentality, brash Australian owner played by Josh Lawson). Veronica then becomes a non-presence\u2014a shame considering how much Applegate enriched and complicated the original\u2014so that Ron can be Ron, jamming his tonsils into the lens and bellowing nonsense while his GNN producer (Dylan Baker) looks on, aghast. Granted, a movie about Ron competing with Veronica to salve his wounded ego and win back her love would have felt like a baldfaced rehash of \"Anchorman,\" but let's face it: that's what \"The Legend Continues\" is anyway. Why not make it official? Many of the first film's now beloved (or notorious) set-pieces get rehashed, including the jazz flute solo, the scene in which Brian Fantana shows off his cologne collection (this time it's condoms) and the bloody battle of the news teams (restaged here with more participants, weirder weaponry, and more guest stars).\u00a0The sequel gives Ron two foils\u2014handsome and obnoxious rival anchor Jack Lime (James Marsden) and hotshot news director Linda Jackson (Meagan Good)\u2014but doesn't develop either in a coherent manner. Ron's competition with Lime is poured into a single dumb bet whose punchline is repeated but never gets any funnier, and the tension between Ron and Linda\u2014which flowers into a romance that neither the actors nor the film seem to believe in\u2014is half-baked at best.\u00a0 Linda, in fact, makes zero sense as a character. She's cagey, she's impulsive, she finds Ron intolerable but wants to sleep with him and then be his love-dovey girlfriend? Say what? She's also the butt of jokes that are meant to send up Ron's entitled white guyness (on first meeting her, he keeps blurting out \"black\" over and over) but that often seem like pretexts to have a white guy say racist things in front of black characters who are written in a way that stops them from properly responding to his idiocy. Ron's attempt to talk jive at a dinner with Linda's straitlaced bourgeois family\u2014at one point using the phrase \"pipe-hittin' bitches\"\u2014is the movie's low point.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Anchorman 2,\" which is co-written by Ferrell and McKay, lacks the original's momentum. It only sometimes builds to the peaks of lunacy that you want and need from this sort of picture. It goes here, it goes there, it does this, it does that; occasionally it remembers that Ron has goals and desires and that the film needs to end at some point, and after 100 minutes or so, end it does. You could describe most W.C. Fields or Marx brothers or Jerry Lewis movies the same way, of course. But here\u2014unlike in the old great works of context-free clowning, or \"Anchorman,\" a modern classic of raucous silliness\u2014most of the scenes and gags feel more slapped together than summoned from the head of Zeus. And there are too many reaction shots of characters saying things along the lines of, \"Why, that's ridiculous\" or \"You can't do that!\"\u2014the screen comedy version of trying to make a sentence more exciting by ending with an exclamation point! An exclamation point! Yes! \u00a0 There are a handful of strong sequences. The early stretch in which Ron rebuilds his news team en route to GNN is a kick: Fantana is a hotshot photographer who at first seems to be a porn king but isn't; David Koechner's sports guy Champ Kind is running a chain of chicken restaurants that don't actually sell chicken, and chronically stupid weatherman Brick Tamland is...well, let's not spoil it, except to say that someone involved with \"Anchorman 2\" has read \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\" And every now and then, the movie gives you a dandy one-off image or line, such as the Patrick Nagel caricatures on the walls of the news team's swingin' bachelor pad, or the lovestruck banter between Brick and an equally dim office assistant played by Kristin Wiig. (\"Last night a bird chased me and I wished it was you,\" she tells him.)\u00a0And there's a sequence near the end that feels like the seed of a far richer, stranger sequel: a sendup of the corny \"inspirational\" TV movies that viewers of a certain age will remember all too well, in which a character overcomes a handicap after years of feeling sorry for himself. But these are bright spots in a film that's just a couple of notches above an off-brand \"SNL\" time-waster.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Cannibal", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "The opening scenes of Manual Mart\u00edn Cuenca\u2019s \u201cCannibal\u201d are\r\nstrikingly effective. The credits roll slowly over a long shot of a gas station\r\nat night; florescent lights surrounded by pitch-black darkness. With memories\r\nof George Sluizer\u2019s \"The Vanishing,\" and that eerie isolation we all feel in\r\nsuch places, Cuenca creates a sense of unease with just\u00a0one establishing shot,\r\nand he amplifies the intensity when the credits end, the camera pans down to a\r\nwheel & dashboard, and Cuenca reveals that it\u2019s been a POV shot: a madman chasing the\r\nweary travelers at the station. What follows is equally effective as Carlos\r\n(Antonio de la Torre) chases his targets, causing an accident, and carting a\r\nvictim home for, well, dinner. Carlos is the \u201ctitle character,\u201d a man who eats\r\nthe flesh of other men and has been so isolated emotionally that the intrusion\r\nof two women into his life shatters his precise worldview.  Advertisement \r\n\r\nCarlos is a well-respected tailor in Granada. He also eats\r\npeople. Cuenca avoids gore but gets the point across in moments that don't involve actual ingestion, such as when Carlos\r\nplaces his first victim on a table and smells her body like a chef smells a\r\npiece of fish for freshness. This is not \u201cHannibal\u201d-level grotesquery but more\r\nglimpses of a terrifying life lived behind closed doors. In one of the film\u2019s\r\nbest moments, Carlos\u2019 new neighbor Alexandra (Olimpia Melinte) opens his\r\nrefrigerator to see that it\u2019s filled only with bloody packages, to which she\r\nsays, \u201cYou only have meat. Why do you only have meat?\u201d  Shortly after that inquiry with no good answer, Alexandra goes missing. Her\r\nsister Nina (also played by Melinte) comes to investigate the disappearance and\r\nfinds herself drawn to the quiet tailor who lives downstairs. She may find\r\nsomething intriguing about the supportive Carlos but we know not only is he a\r\nserial killer but probably ate her sister. You can imagine how well that love\r\naffair unfolds. The entire first act has that visual sparseness of the\r\nopening scene: Carlos watching his new neighbor through a window, doing his\r\njob, preparing his meals, etc. There\u2019s an almost complete lack of dialogue that\r\nfuels the unease. It makes sense that Carlos wouldn\u2019t talk to himself. However,\r\nas \u201cCannibal\u201d progresses it becomes both more traditional in its narrative and\r\nfrustrating in its lack of depth. Cannibalism is really an unexplored part of\r\nCarlos\u2019 personality in the film. A single episode of NBC\u2019s \u201cHannibal\u201d gets\r\ndeeper into the disturbed mind of a man who eats other men than the entirety of\r\n\u201cCannibal.\u201d While it\u2019s somewhat respectable that Cuenca turns something as\r\ninherently wrong as cannibalism into\u00a0little more than a\u00a0protagonist\u2019s fatal flaw, ignoring its\r\ngreater implications and even how Carlos developed such a nasty habit makes for\r\na film that can feel hollow.  There are moments in \u201cCannibal\u201d that hint at a better film:\r\nThat opening scene. A terrifying sequence in the middle of pitch-black night in\r\nwhich a naked woman knows the rolling waters away from shore that likely hold\r\ndeath are preferable to the mysterious man on the beach waiting for her in the\r\nother direction. A few revelatory beats in the final act. And the performers\r\nare all strong, especially Melinte.  Despite those moments, knowing as little about Carlos as we do makes for a film\r\nthat frustrates. Why does he push out\r\nAlexandra but invite Nina in? As hard as it is to imagine consistency in the\r\nmind of a cannibal, there are actions that Carlos takes in regard to Nina that\r\nfeel like screenwriting devices. Is he trapping her? Is he falling in love at\r\nfirst sight? Why has a killer of women found someone to be kind to? There\r\nseems to be deep sexual dysfunction, of course, but, like too many elements of\r\nthe film, it\u2019s never really explored. Ultimately, Cuenca keeps us in that\r\nopening shot\u2014far from the action\u2014and never makes the narrative switch to really\r\ngive us the POV of a \u201cCannibal.\u201d Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Raising Bertie", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Two of the most impressive elements of Steve James' \"Hoop Dreams\u201d are captured again in \"Raising Bertie,\" the latest from Kartemquin Films (makers of James\u2019 landmark documentary, as well as \u201cThe Interrupters,\u201d \u201cThe Trials of Muhammad Ali,\u201d and many more). When I saw \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d for the first time, I can remember being instantly impressed with two structural elements of the film\u2014the time commitment and the hands-off approach. James and his crew spent so much time with their subjects, allowing their growth and the impact of events in their lives to dictate the content of the film. And, along the same lines, they never felt like they were intervening, taking an approach often referred to as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Both aspects of that approach are at the foundation of \u201cRaising Bertie.\u201d The filmmakers, led by Margaret Byrne in her debut directorial effort, spent years with their subjects, and they offer their stories to us without much commentary, just allowing us a window into lives that are likely very different from our own. Roger\u2019s famous quote about film being an empathy machine has been making the rounds extensively since the election last week, and it seems apt here in that I never would have heard of Bertie, North Carolina if it weren\u2019t for this movie, and using art to learn about every corner of our country seems more essential than ever. Advertisement Byrne started the project with an effort to make a film about The Hive, an alternative school for at-risk boys in Bertie. There she met three young men, Reginald 'Junior' Askew, David 'Bud' Perry and Davonte 'Dada' Harrell. All three men were on the precipice of falling through society\u2019s cracks, as made clear by community activist Vivian Saunders when she notes how close the Hive is to one of many nearby prisons. At a certain point, these young men have a choice to commit to education or risk ending up at one of those state-run institutions like so many of their fathers, friends and brothers. Saunders hopes that The Hive will be the life preserver these young men need. Then the Board of Education closes it. With that change in focus, Byrne\u2019s film became something else. The three boys are forced to return to Bertie High School, even though they already struggled there in the past, and the sense that this couldn\u2019t possibly work out for them is palpable. Watching them struggle to concentrate during class and feel even more isolated from the process is heartbreaking. Byrne\u2019s approach shows a clear affection for these three young men, especially as they come of age before our eyes, becoming men instead of boys. It's also fascinating to consider how the production changed their trajectory. In one of the film\u2019s most memorable moments, Junior has faced a life setback that he seems reticent to talk about on camera for fear of embarrassment. How much did the entire production of \u201cRaising Bertie\u201d change their lives just by being a potentially judgmental observer?  There are times when \u201cRaising Bertie\u201d can seem a bit too unfocused, but it\u2019s a project that always feels worthwhile for the opportunity it provides to expand an often-narrow view of the country. The conversation of the United States is often defined by what people think and feel on the coasts, and we were certainly reminded recently that there can be very different worldviews and experiences in the heartland that are rarely shown for public consumption. And yet it never feels like Byrne\u2019s film is designed as a statement about all black young men living on the edge of poverty and falling through the cracks of our educational system. It is a case study, a film driven by the people it captures, and it fits the Kartemquin model of filmmaking well. They clearly believe that by getting to know others we also get to know ourselves.

{"Title": "Oldboy", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Because the Internet moves with the speed and ferocity of a hornet swarm, there's a chance that by the time you read this, Spike Lee's American remake of \"Oldboy\" will already have been stung to death. If so, too bad. This American version of Park Chan-Wook's Korean thriller is Lee's most exciting movie since \"Inside Man\"\u2014not a masterpiece by any stretch, but a lively commercial genre picture with a hypnotic, obsessive quality, and an utter indifference to being liked, much less approved of.\u00a0The studio that released \"Oldboy\" doesn't seem to like the movie any more than critics: it stifled pre-release discussion by making reviewers sign non-disclosure agreements, and forced Lee to\u00a0shorten an apparently much longer director's cut. So barring a miracle, this film is doomed.\u00a0 Advertisement Like Park's version, \"Oldboy\" tells of a drunken, abusive lout named Joe Doucette (Josh Brolin) who's imprisoned for a long time by a mysterious jailer. He gets clean in prison, then escapes to learn the identity of his tormentor and punish him. Like Park's version, this one's a reptilian brain film, all violence and sex and fear and revenge and crying and screaming. The lighting is dark but the colors are supersaturated, especially in scenes with a lot of blood, neon, or wet pavement. The camera goes much lower or much higher than you expect it to, and peers at the characters from disorienting angles. Bruce Hornsby contributes a score in a Bernard Herrmann vein, an instrumental chorus to the modern urban version of a Greek tragedy. As Joe, the alcoholic ad executive, Brolin is a raw nerve at first\u2014a bloated and haggard man whose smile and laugh are false. From certain angles he looks and sounds like the young Nick Nolte: a brutish alpha male gone to seed, but not without a certain tenderness. Drink is ruining his life and estranging him from his wife and newborn daughter. We sense that his alcoholism is a symptom of long-held guilt that will be explained as the tale unfolds, and we're more right than we could imagine. Joe finds himself trapped in a jail cell made up to look like a hotel suite, getting mysterious updates on the room's TV about the life of the daughter that he never got to know. He stays there for twenty years (five more than in Park's version). After seeming eons of self-pity capped by a suicide attempt, he starts a Travis Bickle-like regimen of Spartan self-improvement, winnowing himself down into a lean, mean killer, and finally escaping to seek vengeance against his tormentor. Where the film's first half is a Kafka-esque fable of guilt and punishment, the second is a riff on the criminal revenge flick, with Joe working his way through the underbelly of a New York City that's been reimagined as a landscape of the mind. He joins up with a drug clinic worker played by Elizabeth Olsen and slowly begins piecing together the identity of his jailer: a rich and rather effete sadist (Sharlto Copley of \"District 9\") who knew Joe a long time ago, and who now lives like a drug dealer from an '80s cop thriller.\u00a0 Advertisement Lee restages some famous (or infamous) moments from the original, including the hammer fight, pictured here as a more elaborately choreographed scene that unfolds over two levels of a warehouse populated by criminals and ruled by a glowering boss played by Samuel L. Jackson (seemingly channeling his character from \"Unbreakable\"). In other cases, the film changes small details (including specific violent acts and lines of dialogue) or else jokingly acknowledges places where even it won't go (the scene in the original in which the hero devours a live octopus is thrown away by having Joe glance at one in a restaurant fishtank). \u00a0It all leads to a climactic revelation identical to the one in Park's movie, though key details of the back story have been changed, and the denouement is more harsh and sad. If you haven't seen the original \"Oldboy,\" which provided the template for most of this one, I won't spoil it here. Suffice to say that Lee and his screenwriter Mark Protosevich do a good job of keeping their cards close to their vest, and when they finally play them, the result has a sick, powerful charge.\u00a0 It's worth pointing out here that Park's film is not an original story, but an adaptation of a Japanese\u00a0comic book\u00a0of the same name. Both versions find ways to visually suggest that you're reading a big-screen graphic novel with pages that come to life. The compositions in Lee's movie have such a painterly or \"illustrated\" quality that they might as well have thick black lines marking off the edges of the frame. At no point does the film try to be \"realistic,\" except when it comes to the strong, simple emotions that its characters feel. Lee's \"Oldboy,\" like Park's, obeys its own illogical logic (a hotel room hallucination starring Lee's brother Cinque has the goofy randomness of a joke in a David Lynch movie). The whole thing flows as dreams flow, linking situations to other situations and images to other images in a seemingly free-associative manner.\u00a0 At its wooziest, Lee's direction reminded me of Brian DePalma or John Carpenter in nightmare reverie mode, or Alfred Hitchcock when he seemed possessed by whatever horrible muses drove him.\u00a0It's purely intuitive, at times musical, direction. The lack of a political dimension seems to have freed Lee to be looser and more (cruelly) playful than usual. There's news footage on Joe's hotel room TV, but when we see, for instance, scenes from 9/11 or the Iraq war, it's not meant to drive home anything but the passage of time and its effect on Joe's psyche. The performances are all over the map, in what struck me as a DePalma-like way. Some actors give fairly naturalistic performances (Brolin and Olsen) while others (Jackson and Copley) chew the scenery into fine shreds and then pluck them from their shiny teeth. Lee presides over the madness with a droll serenity that says, \"This is the movie; deal with it.\" Advertisement The big problem with Lee's \"Oldboy\" is that for all its dark confidence, it doesn't\u00a0reimagine the original boldly enough. This isn't like Martin Scorsese's \"Cape Fear,\" David Cronenberg's \"The Fly\" or Jonathan Demme's \"The Manchurian Candidate\"\u2014or the recent superhero-inflected version of \"Carrie,\" which I liked better than most critics\u2014all of which drastically rethought their inspirations. Lee's \"Oldboy,\" in contrast, is more like \"Point of No Return,\" the American remake of \"La Femme Nikita.\" It's so close to its predecessor in so many ways that I can't see much reason for it to exist, except to give xenophobic viewers an experience similar to the original, but minus the subtitled Korean and the octopus-eating scene\u2014and with a more ostentatiously cartoonish bad guy, and lot more monologuing to explain the convoluted plot.\u00a0 That's not a bad thing, though, when you consider the current climate for mainstream American films. For people who haven't seen the original \"Oldboy\" or anything like it, this will be a rare studio release that feels shocking and abrasive and perverse and in some way new. I'd love to sit through Lee's movie again in a theater with newbies who came to see a straightforward revenge picture starring a guy who's been locked up for a long time and have no idea what they're actually in for: a swan-dive into the toxic id. Few American auteurs are making mainstream studio movies in the vein of Spike Lee's \"Oldboy\": unabashedly hardcore genre pictures that aren't afraid to treat sex and violence as colors on a palette, and get nasty and raw, in that seventies-movie way.\u00a0Park's \"Oldboy\" was no skip through the daisy field, but this one is even harder to watch, sometimes indulging in savagery that blurs the line between Old Testament morality play and straight-up exploitation.The filmmakers seem obsessed with making everything as extreme as possible, replacing, for example, a bruising bit of hammer torture with a prolonged sequence in which the hero uses an X-acto knife to slice a dotted-line-shaped pattern into a former jailer's throat. \u00a0 Roger Ebert's four-star review of the original praised it as \"the kind of movie that can no longer easily be made in the United States\" thanks to content restrictions imposed by \"a puritanical minority.\" The same sentiments apply here, but even more so, because Park's film came out ten years ago, and things have only gotten more restrictive since then. Plenty of international filmmakers are working in this mode\u2014Park, Takashi Miike, Nicolas Winding Refn and Lars von Trier spring immediately to mind\u2014but not too many English-language directors, aside from Quentin Tarantino and sometimes Oliver Stone (\"Savages\"). Martin Scorsese and David Cronenberg used to make this sort of picture all the time, but haven't in a while, perhaps because it's just too much for some people, and \"just too much\" movies tend not to get made at a major studio level because the financial stakes are too grave.\u00a0I don't like or approve of everything in \"Oldboy,\" but I'm glad it exists. The multiplexes are filled with PG-13 movies that should have been R-rated movies, released by studios that don't make adults-only genre films anymore. This is one such film, starring a real actor, directed by a real director. It deserves to be seen and argued about.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}

All the ingredients are here, I guess, for an involving and\r\ntricky thriller in which actual reality opposes itself to computer-driven\r\nreality, not to mention all the potential for social commentary such a scenario\r\nengenders. David Cronenberg springs to mind, as do the post-nuke \u201cspecial\u201d\r\nchildren bred and trained in Joseph Losey\u2019s early \u201860s \u201cThe Damned.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s Be\r\nEvil\u201d does not get within swinging, spitting, or any kind of distance of those\r\naforementioned films. There\u2019s no reliable conceptual framework, no actual\r\nopposition between villain and protagonist, not much of anything but the\r\ncomputer graphics, the flickering lights and eventual blackouts and\r\ncrawl-through-the-ventilation scares that worked a lot better in the likes of\r\n\u201cDemons 2\u201d than they do here. The movie\u2019s relentless one-note tone makes its\r\nfinal twist, such as it is, entirely predictable and pat. I was surprised to see\r\nthat this picture had an unrolling at this year\u2019s Slamdance Film Festival,\r\nwhere once upon a time pictures such as Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cFollowing\u201d and\r\nJonathan Weiss\u2019 \u201cThe Atrocity Exhibition\u201d unspooled.

{"Title": "The Selfish Giant", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "\"The Selfish Giant\" is easy to admire but difficult to recommend, because its vision of friendship, poverty and desperation is so stark. Written and directed by Clio Barnard, this film about adolescent boys who gather scrap to help their families is based on a fable by Oscar Wilde. But where Wilde's story summons warmly cathartic tears, the tears this film earns are colder and grimmer. Its outcome feels both unfair and inevitable. The film is set in West Yorkshire in Northern England, against a backdrop of cooling towers and buzzing transformers. There's no hint of a healthy economy. This slice of life seems populated mainly by scavengers and people who used to scavenge but gave up.\u00a0Its heroes are the smallish, blond\u00a0Arbor (Conner Chapman), who's hot-tempered and impulsive and seems to have a spectrum disorder, and the taller, kinder, dark-haired Swifty (Shaun Thomas), who often serves as Arbor's voice of reason. They're best friends, as close as brothers. Advertisement Arbor lives with his exhausted and short-fused single mom\u00a0(Rebecca Manley) and his\u00a0drug-addled, volatile older brother (Elliott Tittensor). \u00a0Swifty's house is as cramped and rundown as Arbor's; it's packed with seven siblings, plus an angry drunk dad (Steve Evets)\u00a0and a mom (Siobhan Finneran of \"Downton Abbey\") who has the haunted look of a prisoner who has accepted that she'll die behind bars. One of the first scenes set in Swifty's house ends with Swifty's dad dragging a fake-leather couch out of the living room and onto the lawn; he plans to sell it to pay the electric bill.\u00a0 Arbor and Swifty want to improve their lot. \u00a0They see a glimmer of hope in selling discarded appliances, cookware and wiring to scrapyards. They borrow a broken-down horse from a scrapyard owner to draw a cart around, but the scrapyard owner\u2014the innocuously named Kitten (Sean Gilder)\u2014charges them for the animal, and sometimes skims more at the end, because he can. \u00a0The boys soon realize there's more money in copper wiring than in dumpster and curbside garbage. They start collecting wire that was never meant to be collected, growing more brazen with each outing, as if daring fate to crush them.\u00a0 Kitten encourages Arbor and Swifty to take greater risks for bigger payouts. We're given to understand that this is typical behavior\u2014that scrapyard owners passively encourage minors to \"liberate\" other people's property because they can't be punished too harshly if the cops catch the kids thieving, or if somebody has an accident.\u00a0The boys' industriousness pays off in the short term: their eyes light up when they see wads of cash being pushed through pay windows. But in the long term, it's a sucker's game.\u00a0 Advertisement Barnard fills out this subculture with a journalist's eye. The light, the soot, the fog, the way sun hits the sides of buildings, the subtitled slang-riddled dialect, the posturing, the moments of ribald humor and casual bullying, the offhand exploitation of children and horses, all bespeak great powers of observation.\u00a0Barnard sometimes films the boys in long shot. They're flyspecks inching along cracked pavement and weed-strewn fields, industrial northlands looming behind them. Even when these images are used for rhythmic purposes\u2014to give the eye a chance to breathe between bouts of close-up camerawork\u2014they're never purely pictorial; they're putting the boys and their story in a larger context.\u00a0 A low-speed chase between rickety horse carts has a nerve-wracking physicality. In a time of CGI-driven filmmaking, even the most epic action has little dramatic or figurative weight. This is, no matter what safety precautions were taken, an actual event. \u00a0You worry about the horses and riders who are being followed by a carloads of drunken spectators and bettors, a soused peanut gallery on wheels.\u00a0 The filmmaker shows how the metal is collected and haggled over, and the personal and economic factors that affect scrappers' and buyers' survival.\u00a0The viewer may be reminded of the borderline-slave economies of the early 20th century American economy, before the unions settled in. Just as a 1920s miner was docked for his clothes, tools, room and meals, and came to feel as though he were working for the privilege of being allowed to live, the scrappers' game is rigged against them. In time, the junkyard horse seems analogous to the humans it serves: a beast of burden valued only for the weight it can bear. \"The Selfish Giant\" may remind you of other films about childhood under harsh circumstances, none of which, to put it mildly, were upbeat:\u00a0\"Killer of Sheep,\" \"Sounder,\" \"Los Olvidados,\" \"Panther Pachali\" and \"Kes.\" It's not on the level of those inspirations\u2014its doom-spiral story feels contrived in places\u2014but there's no denying its effectiveness. The film is a tragedy: keenly observed, warm, often funny, but a tragedy.\u00a0And yet even when the life-on-rails dramaturgy becomes wearisome, we feel we're watching an evil adult exploit angelic children. Arbor and Swifty aren't \"good\" or \"bad\" boys, just desperate and far too trusting. Kitten isn't a villain, just a mangled product of his environment like everyone else.\u00a0 Advertisement This is a social realist drama of the sort that another English filmmaker, Ken Loach, has been making for decades, but less didactic in how it reveals the political and economic dimensions of its characters' lives.\u00a0It's about how an extended village made up of local, regional and national governments fails two boys, their families and their communities. The school and social service employees who are supposed to monitor at-risk kids are so overworked, poorly trained or under-supported that all they can do is reflexively punish problem kids, or look away as they disrupt class and commit petty crimes. Kids and adults alike taunt each other for not being \"hard\" enough. We get the sense that all of these characters wouldn't be so tough, sometimes cruel, if the economy offered them a way to live in dignity and peace. At certain points, the relationship between Arbor and Swifty may remind you of John Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men,\" but in this version of the story, the little one is the unpredictable, emotionally limited outcast, and the big one is his guardian and minder, and they're both just boys who should be thinking of the future, not slaving away in the present. Their fate should not have been a foregone conclusion, and there's plenty of blame to go around. \"If\u00a0a fella steps on a round pebble and he falls down, breaks his neck, it ain't the pebble's fault,\" George says in the novel, \"but the guy wouldn't a done it if the pebble hadn't been there.\"", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Last Word", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Fresh from her television appearance looking aghast at her brother Warren Beatty after the already legendary Best-Picture-flub at the Oscars, Shirley MacLaine is in a new theatrical release. Like too many movies in which the lead performer is over 80 years of age (the great MacLaine will turn 83 in April), \u201cThe Last Word\u201d opens with a montage of photographs of said performer in her youth, and young adulthood, in this case doctored to make it look like she spent that adulthood being something other than a great motion picture star. Advertisement The movie\u2019s opening proper finds MacLaine standing in front of one of the gabled windows of the spacious house in which her character, Harriet Lauler, lives in comfortable isolation. Seemingly friendless, she haunts the grounds of her property, control-freaking-out both her landscaper (hey, that\u2019s Gedde Watanabe!) and live-in cook (Yvette Freeman). She is sick of life, and so she half-heartedly tries to end it, but after a tetchy confrontation with a physician she\u2019s struck by a notion: to commission her own obituary. So determined, she marches into the offices of her California town\u2019s local paper (which, she reminds its current editor, she saved on many occasions while she made her fortune working in advertising) and demands to meet its obit writer. This turns out to be another woman, a young disaffected one named Anne Sherman, played by Amanda Seyfried. \u201cThe thought of leaving my obituary to chance is very unreasonable to me,\u201d Harriet explains to Anne, laying out what she believes to be her bona fides as a \u201creasonable\u201d woman.  I don\u2019t know how long this movie\u2019s script, by Stuart Ross Fink, has been kicking around, but there\u2019s something distinctly off about Seyfried\u2019s character. Her mien, attitude, mode of dress, all that, suggest she\u2019s a time traveler, come to 2017 America directly from the release date of the first Pixies album. (That would be March 21, 1988.) It\u2019s a testimony to Seyfried\u2019s work that this peculiarity does not necessarily stick in one\u2019s craw as the movie progresses.  And the movie progresses pretty precisely along the lines its premise suggests, if not demands. It is of course A Journey in which a Crusty Older Woman instructs an Unformed Younger Woman in the art of not compromising, and the Unformed Younger Woman instructs the Crusty Older Woman in healing old relationships and forming new ones. And there\u2019s even an adorable underprivileged little African-American girl, Brenda (AnnJewel Lee Dixon) along for the ride, which includes a road trip in which a rapprochement with Harriet\u2019s estranged daughter (Anne Heche) is broached.  This is, among other things, something of a fatty movie. It goes out of its way to hit \u201cbeats\u201d that it presumes will be satisfying to a mainstream audience, as when Anne, Harriet, and Brenda bond over McDonald\u2019s food during their road trip. The one mildly unexpected piece of character development comes when Anne encourages Harriet to do something with her modest but choice vinyl collection. This leads to a rhapsody on the joys of hearing a perfectly sequenced radio set, and soon Harriet herself is inveigling the manager of a free-form FM station (there\u2019s that influence from 1988 again) into giving her the \u201cdrive time\u201d slot as a DJ. Anne is actually shopping at a used record store when she hear Harriet on the air for the first time. Who goes record shopping between six and eleven in the morning? None of the record stores I used to go to even OPENED before eleven. In any event, it\u2019s in this area that the movie, oddly enough, finds some interesting footing. Director Mark Pellington, who began his career as an in-house rebel at MTV, still has a sharp sense about music and people\u2019s potential relation to it, and Harriet\u2019s DJing sets are a highlight. As are certain quiet, individual scenes between MacLaine and Seyfried. A less expansive treatment of the story might have yielded a less persistently conventional character study, this suggests. But to get to what\u2019s good about \u201cThe Last Word\u201d you\u2019re obliged to take it warts and all.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Z for Zachariah", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "The Garden of Eden isn't big enough for three people, it seems.\u00a0Chiwetel Ejiofor, Margot Robbie and Chris Pine's characters find that out the hard way in \"Z for Zachariah,\" an adaptation of a posthumously-published novel by\u00a0Robert C. O'Brien (\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh\"). It's set in the aftermath of unspecified decline-and-fall that definitely included nuclear weapons; pockets of radiation are everywhere, even in remote rural areas, and the film includes sequences where radiation-proof suits are used and people talk about underground bases and protocols. It's hard enough just to survive out here, or so we're told; forget about rebuilding civilization. Advertisement And yet that's exactly what the film's three characters (the only ones onscreen) try to do. The story begins with Ann (Robbie), a farm woman who inherited the place from her beloved church-building saint of a father, finding the title character (Eijofor) and nursing him back to health. The first third or so of the film is a two-character play that shows Zachariah gaining strength and getting to know Ann, who's sweet but skittish and socially awkward (they both are\u2014who wouldn't be under the circumstances?), and forming something like a partnership, with the potential to become something else. Pine's character, Caleb, eventually enters the picture; I don't think this is a spoiler considering that Pine's name and face are on the poster. The addition of a third character, and one who's as ridiculously good-looking as the other two, injects a welcome note of tension into what was otherwise feeling like an exceptionally acted and photographed (in widescreen, by the masterful Tim Orr) psychodrama about really, really nice people. There are racial and religious overtones to the way that Ann, Caleb and Zachariah try to work together, and relate to each other, and especially in the way that Ejiofor plays Zachariah, an engineer, as a man who worked hard, became a success in his chosen field, found a mate that he loved dearly, then lost everything in the cataclysm, and now finds himself having to compete with a younger, more cooly charismatic white man for the only available female. To make matters worse, Ann and Caleb seem to have an immediate chemistry that's more labored than the more paternal, or at least big-brotherly, energy that she has with Zachariah. Race is never explicitly mentioned in the film, except rather pointedly in one scene, but it colors, pardon the word, every suffering closeup of Zachariah as he watches Ann and Caleb flirt and trade not-so-furtive glances.\u00a0 As for religion, Ann's dad built the local church, and Zachariah strongly advises tearing it down for raw material to create a wheel that will generate electricity from a local waterfall. As adapted by Nissan Modi and directed by Craig Zobel (\"The Great World of Sound,\" \"Compliance\"), the movie is rather coy in how it frames Zachariah's (and later, Caleb's) enthusiasm for tearing down the church. It represents a destruction of the old order to create something new, but also (conversely) a rejection of the very patriarchal authority that both Zachariah and Caleb often represent to Ann, and that Ann's father represented to her back in the day. \u00a0 Advertisement This is all good stuff, classic science fiction issue-driven myth making in the manner of \"The World, The Flesh and the Devil,\" which also had a triangle involving two white characters and a black character. The performers are entirely committed to the director's vision, as is Orr, whose careful framing and movement reveals the film's wilderness panoramas (shot on location in New Zealand) with tremendous intelligence as well as an appreciation for the textures of mountains and forests, and the way muted light fills up the interior of a dilapidated convenience store. There are many sharply written, directed and performed moments of illumination and anxiety.\u00a0 There are a lot of problems, too, though, and they might prove to be deal breakers for some. One is the studied nature of the performances. Who knows if it's the direction or simply an instinctive response to the script, but some of Eijofor's choices feel overly deliberate here, for the first time I can remember (he's one of the great leading men right now). Robbie fares slightly worse in that her \"southern\" accent and mannerisms are so polished that I never quite bought Ann as anything other than a technically excellent performance. There's nothing outwardly \"wrong\" about Robbie's work here, and maybe it's unfair to complain about somebody who's put so much thought into her work, but all you have to do is picture somebody more naturalistic and maybe American (a young Sissy Spacek, maybe, or Elizabeth Banks the way she was in \"Magic Mike XXL\") and you can sense the kind of missed opportunity I'm trying to describe. \u00a0Pine fares best of the three leads, although to be fair he's playing the closest thing to an action hero, somebody defined mainly by his presence in a scene, the way he moves and reacts. He's great at that, and he is also, for some reason (maybe his Americanness?) more believable as a drawling, scruffy, slightly dangerous backwoods American than his costars are in their roles.\u00a0 Worse, \"Z for Zachariah\" is ultimately too dramatically slight and brief for its ambitions, despite its sometimes labored myth-making script and visuals. And it's ultimately unwilling to truly commit to the idea of life during the end of the world as we know it. This is one of the few science fiction films I've seen recently where the production design, costumes, hair and makeup effectively neutralize a lot of what the screenplay and direction and performances are trying to accomplish. Ann's house looks too clean, too nice, too fussed-over, almost like a vacation home that a movie producer might stay in while convincing himself he was getting back in touch with the natural world. Caleb's been sleeping in the woods for weeks when we first meet him, but when he takes off his baseball cap, he's got a fashionable brush cut that looks like it might've been administered at a high-end Beverly Hills salon. Zachariah's hair and beard are just as well-tended, and the signature light tan jacket that he wears in outdoor scenes is immaculately clean and so crisp that it seems to have been ironed seconds before the cameras started rolling. There's a shot late in the film, after Ann has been put through the emotional wringer, that's just so wrong in its visual particulars (she's resting her head on a tabletop that's obviously just been cleaned within an inch of its life, and wearing a fuzzy cable-knit sweater that seems to have come right out of a gift box) that you roll your eyes when you should be weeping for everything that's been lost. Details like this are way too Hollywood, and they take you out of the story just when you should be immersed in it most deeply. Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Mechanic: Resurrection", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "Usually, when a studio declines to screen a movie for\r\nreviewers, the reflexive assumption is that the picture is a dog. This largely\r\nturns out to be true, but not always. As for \u201cMechanic: Resurrection,\u201d the disinclination of\r\nLionsgate to present it to viewers was a little puzzling in a different\r\nrespect. Sure, the 2011 film \u201cThe Mechanic,\u201d a Jason Statham/Ben Foster starring remake\r\nof the 1972 Charles Bronson/Jan-Michael Vincent master hitman thriller, only\r\ngot a 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but I thought it was pretty okay,\r\nand that\u2019s all that counts. Given that the sequel pairs off Statham\u2019s\r\nimplacable best-of-the-best anonymous assassin with charming genre movie mascot\r\nJessica Alba, and has Tommy Lee Jones third-billed or so, with Hong Kong\r\neminence Michelle Yeoh rounding out the supporting cast, well, how bad could it\r\nbe? Advertisement Not good, is the answer, learned at an early Thursday\r\nevening screening. Despite some of the most picturesque locations money can\r\nbuy, and some not unimpressive looking movable props (yachts with helipads and\r\nsuch) and so on, \u201cMechanic: Resurrection\u201d suffers from a storyline and script\r\nthat strains credulity and insults intelligence even by the low bar set by the\r\nmajority of contemporary action movies.\u00a0 The picture opens with Statham\u2019s Arthur Bishop\r\ncomfortably ensconced, \u00e0 la Travis McGee, on a houseboat in Rio. The steadiness\r\nof the houseboat is such that Bishop, now known as Santos, can rock out with a\r\nvinyl turntable. But not for long. Lunching at his favorite cliffside outdoor\r\nrestaurant, he\u2019s approached by a femme fatale who Knows Who He Really Is, and\r\nwho tells him her \u201cPrincipal\u201d wants him to kill three targets. Santos/Bishop\u2019s\r\nviolent refusal to play ball is met with an attack by a small military\r\nbattalion\u2019s worth of men. Not only does this action sequence fail to build a\r\nhead of steam, but the lack of logic is a little startling. I need you to kill\r\nthese men for me, because only you can do it, and if you refuse, I will kill\r\nyou myself. Spot the flaw in this thinking.  Bishop of course escapes, and regroups at a seaside village\r\nin Thailand, watched over by old pal Mei, played by Yeoh. Soon enough a honey\r\ntrap with Alba as the bait makes itself known. But Alba\u2019s not a villainess. Her\r\ncharacter, Gina, is being extorted in a sense by supervillain Crain, a bland\r\nSam Hazeldine. If Gina doesn\u2019t play ball, Crain\u2019s going to torch the Cambodian\r\norphanage at which Gina is a beloved fixture. Yes, you read that right.  Tending to Gina\u2019s wounds in one scene, Mei says to her\r\npatient, \u201cMy father was a doctor of Eastern medicine. He was a healer.\u201d Well,\r\nyes, I would hope so. Later in the movie, Gina says to Bishop, \u201cThose kids are\r\neverything to me. If they get trafficked or killed I just couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d\r\nBishop responds, \u201cI was an orphan too.\u201d Wow. This isn\u2019t just a character note:\r\nit\u2019s a plot point. Crain was a childhood friend of Bishop back at the\r\norphanage. This wasn\u2019t particularly convincing in the last James Bond film and\r\nit works even less here, although if you choose to buy it you may wonder what\r\nit is with British orphanages that make them turn out such efficient killers.\r\nThere\u2019s also the matter of the phrasing of the dialogue itself. \u201cIf they get\r\ntrafficked or killed\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly roll off the tongue. Alba is an\r\nappealing screen presence (and director Daniel Gansel takes some advantage of\r\nthis with a few beach-set shots of the sort that they used to call\r\n\u201ccheesecake\u201d). She is not the most virtuoso actor, but not even Meryl Streep\r\ncould make such dialogue sing.  It\u2019s kind of perplexing: clearly not too much expense was\r\nspared in the beautiful locations and blow-stuff-up effects tech. Writers in\r\nevery industry come cheaper and cheaper these days; surely the producers could\r\nhave invested some of their financing in a script with more\r\ninventiveness and engagement power than the one they had on set. Of\r\ncourse, this still would have left the uninspired direction of Gansel. Might\r\nhe have delivered something more enjoyable with better material? We\u2019ll never\r\nknow. As for Tommy Lee Jones, his role as a roguish arms dealer is not much more than\r\na cameo, for which he chooses to repeat many of the performing riffs he\r\nworked to good effect way way back in 1992\u2019s \u201cUnder Siege,\u201d the elemental but\r\nenjoyable action film that kind of made Jones into a big star. His work here is\r\none of two pieces of wit the movie has to offer; the other is courtesy of production designers Sebastian T. Krawinkel and Antonello Rubino, who\r\nplace a replica of the sculpture in the Mosfilm logo title shot in the\r\nrepository of Soviet kitsch that serves as Jones\u2019 character\u2019s panic room.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "A Million Ways to Die in the West", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "Unexpected success often leads to creative disaster. With no one there to edit his extreme tendencies, to tell him casting himself in the lead might be a mistake, to warn him that breezy comedies shouldn\u2019t be nearly two hours long, Seth MacFarlane\u2019s carte blanche that came with the box office success of \"Ted\" proves to be his undoing. The mistakes made in the production of \"A Million Ways to Die in the West,\" reminiscent of the worst comedic tendencies of the Happy Madison crew, feel like a byproduct of a man-child allowed to do whatever he wants because it worked last time. A failure on nearly every level, \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\" almost approaches so-bad-you-need-to-see-it categorization. There are scenes/jokes that hit the dusty ground of Monument Valley with such a remarkable thud that no one in the preview audience with whom I saw the film laughed. Not one person. Which leads one to ask, how did they make it through the editing/post-production process? As we so often ask ourselves with awful comedies, did they really think this was funny? Advertisement In the first of several bad decisions, the charmless MacFarlane (a talented writer in the prime of \"Family Guy\" but completely unengaging as a leading man) plays Albert Stark, a sheep herder living in the dangerous time of 1882 Arizona. As he points out repeatedly\u2014MacFarlane never wrote a joke he only wanted to tell once\u2014Stark\u2019s world is a deadly one. Cholera, wolves, gunslingers, runaway bulls, exploding flash bulbs; there\u2019s always something to kill you on the Wild West frontier. Written with the kind of meta awareness of what\u2019s happening around him that makes him feel like a time traveler, Albert is an antisocial, lonely guy, especially after his wide-eyed girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) leaves him for the daringly mustachioed Foy (movie-stealing Neil Patrick Harris, who can do more with a raised eyebrow than MacFarlane can with an entire monologue). Albert\u2019s life changes when Anna comes to town. Played by Charlize Theron with a winsome charm that the film doesn\u2019t deserve, Anna sees something in Albert, encouraging him to see how great he really is deep down inside, even though MacFarlane never wrote that into the character. Yes, \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\" is about a man who gets dumped by one girl only to have a beauty of Theron\u2019s caliber inexplicably fall head over cowboy boots for him. It\u2019s a movie about how great Albert is and yet MacFarlane forgot to make him interesting. I\u2019d actually rather hang out with Louise and Foy. Or even buddy Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and his prostitute girlfriend (Sarah Silverman), who don\u2019t have sex even though she sleeps with a dozen guys a day and schedules appointments for anal. Again, if you find that joke funny, good news, it will be repeated multiple times. Anna has a secret: she\u2019s really the wife of the notorious Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson), a man in black who is riding to town to\u2026you know, I have no idea. MacFarlane can\u2019t even be bothered to really set up a film that deconstructs the Western in any sort of narrative sense. He has too many piss jokes to tell. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t mind a bit of envelope-pushing when it comes to taste in comedy but there\u2019s a difference between being edgy and just thinking that the word poop is inherently funny. And, worst of all, MacFarlane telegraphs every joke before he tells it. He\u2019s the kind of guy who is so in love with the punchline that he forgets the set-up. A bit about a family not smiling in a photo at the county fair would be funnier if wasn\u2019t a repeat from ten minutes ago. Ditto a bit about quack doctors. Ditto everything after the first scene with Ribisi & Silverman. The throwaway bits produce the film's only chuckles because they don\u2019t feel underlined, repeated, highlighted and accompanied by a neon sign begging you to laugh. Advertisement It doesn\u2019t help that MacFarlane brings zero filmmaking style to the film. Perhaps he was too distracted by his performance to notice that \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\" looks like a TV special. There were times where I was convinced that he was going for a purposefully constructed aesthetic like an old-fashioned Western and times where I think he was just being lazy. It doesn\u2019t have to look good, right? As long as we get people talking with our gross-out humor, everything else will be forgiven, right? Did you hear the one about the writer/director whose success blinded him to what people liked about his first movie? It\u2019s not that funny.", "Critic": "Beta"}

(\u201cYou\u2019ve got\r\none more year to be a certified welder,\u201d a school counselor tells one, and he\r\nlooks as thrilled by the news as you would.) They are trying to break into\r\ntournament boarding, but the entry fees for even small-time events are beyond\r\nthe means of these poor kids. So they\u2019ve taken to boosting cars and selling\r\nthem to a tightwad chop-shop operator. It\u2019s dangerous business, and Cisco feels\r\nbad about it, largely for moral reasons. He\u2019s got a firsthand glimpse of what\r\nthe shadow side of life can do to a person, having lost his mom to a drug\r\noverdose. When he and his buddies find a stash of very high quality \u201cmolly\u201d in\r\nthe trunk of one car they steal, it\u2019s decision time. Cisco decides to sell off\r\nthe drugs.  I know what you\u2019re thinking: it\u2019s always stealing the wrong\r\ncar from the wrong person, who\u2019s always got a large amount of the wrong thing\r\nstashed in the car. And it\u2019s true: \u201cThe Land\u201d won\u2019t win any awards for\r\noriginality of premise. And the movie, after that premise comes into play,\r\ntends to meander more than a suspense story ought to. It meanders for the best\r\nreason, though, which is to help the viewer get to know the characters,\r\nincluding that of \u201cMomma,\u201d the drug queen who also has local renown as a food\r\ntruck entrepreneur, played by Linda Emond, the Tony-nominated actress who\u2019s also\r\na compelling feature of \u201cIndignation,\u201d also opening this week. Soundness of\r\nrationale notwithstanding, Caple doesn\u2019t always achieve his aim. Some folks in\r\nCisco\u2019s world do register strongly: his self-righteously sober quasi-stepdad,\r\nplayed by Kim Coates, and that fellow\u2019s streetwalker companion, a raw Erykah\r\nBadu. Michael K. Williams is his usual striking self as the father of one of\r\nCisco\u2019s crew. But other stuff fares less well, including the material\r\nconcerning the diminutive Junior; his character\u2019s bearing and circumstances\r\nmake him an instant clich\u00e9, despite actor Moises Aria\u2019s best efforts to bring\r\nhim to life.  Caple also has a tendency to show his influences on his\r\nsleeve, as with a shot from the point of view of the inside of a car trunk. But\r\nI\u2019m giving this movie a recommendation anyway, because the talent on display is\r\nnot insignificant, both in front of and behind the camera. And also because\r\nCaple brings his perhaps familiar narrative to an unexpected, and to my mind refreshing, conclusion. He\u2019s a filmmaker worth watching, here and in the future.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Werner Herzog contemplates the Internet. What more do you need to know about \"Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World\"? The promises and pitfalls of the digital age is the perfect subject for Herzog, a rare filmmaker who's a bigger personality than most of the people he makes films about\u2014and considering the sorts of eccentrics, dreamers and madmen Herzog makes films about, that's saying a lot. If your work entails programming or anything related to the nuts and bolts of digital technology, you're unlikely to encounter anything in this brisk feature that you haven't contemplated at length; but if you spend a good portion of your waking life online, as increasing numbers of viewers do, but take it for granted, you may appreciate the way Herzog comes into the the subject: from a borderline-layman's perspective, wry and curious. He's equally interested in the subjects being discussed and the personalities of the experts laying it all out. Advertisement The film is broken into ten chapters, each annotated like sections of a book, each bearing the sort of quasi-mystical or vaguely ominous title that you'd expect Herzog to affix: \u201cThe Glory of the Internet,\"\u201cThe Dark Side\" and so on. It is essentially a promotional film, financed mainly by\u00a0the cybersecurity firm NetScout, but for all its insistence on the glory of interconnectedness and the transformations it has inspired, Herzog pays nearly equal attention to the downsides, particularly government and corporate surveillance and faceless cruelty. Like a lot of stories of human-created intelligence, in its heart this one is \"Frankenstein.\" A scientist who is inspired or mad, depending on your point of view, creates a child of sorts, and as the child grows into adolescence and adulthood, it starts to take on a life of its own, unsettling and threatening its creator to the point where it eventually seems to be telling the \"parent\" what to do, and even how to evolve.  The movie begins with a scientific \"birth,\" with shots of students walking in slow motion across the University of Southern California Los Angeles. The music is\u00a0the opening of Wagner\u2019s Ring, the Prelude to Das Rheingold; it was memorably used in Terrence Malick's \"The New World,' but it is also associated, like all Wagner's work, with Hitler, who adored Wagner and derived the philosophical underpinnings of Nazism from Wagner's political writing. Many of Herzog's filmmaking choices have that kind of double-edged appropriateness. As Herzog muses on the depressing ugliness of institutional hallways in an academic building on campus, we see a trim older gentleman, computer science professor Leonard Kleinrock, leading the camera through a doorway that leads to the room where the Internet was born in 1969. As Kleinrock shows us the first node in the Internet and talks about ARPANET, a government-supported data network that would use the technology later known as \"packet switching,\" Herzog doesn't interrupt his lively, polished monologue. He seems delighted by Kleinrock's brilliance, enthusiasm and showmanship. The viewer might expect the rest of the film to unfold in this mode, with the director interviewing various scientific founders and technology boosters, creating a gallery of inspirational character sketches along the way.  But two segments later, the film takes a sharp turn into despair and disgust as Herzog visits the parents and siblings of Nikki Catsouras, who was crushed and nearly decapitated in a car wreck in 2006. A highway patrolman at the scene took a photo of her corpse, as regulations required, but then forwarded it to colleagues, and somehow it slipped free and circulated everywhere, and the trolls got hold of it and immediately began tormenting her family by emailing them the photo with snide or vile captions like \"Woo hoo, daddy! I'm still alive!\" The family was so horrified that they withdrew from online life and homeschooled their youngest daughter. Catsouras' mother flat-out tells us that she thinks the devil lives in the Internet and is slowly but surely making all of us more like him.  Advertisement Herzog lets this incident stand in for the troll culture of anonymous harassment and emotional abuse, one of many downsides of the technology that at first was characterized as a gateway to greater understanding. As \"Lo and Behold\" unfolds, he alternates hopeful and grim stories with others in a minor key that could be taken both ways at once.  The section on driverless cars, for instance, optimistically sketches a future where a ride to work is stress free and traffic moves with hive-mind efficiency, then raises the chilling prospect of onboard computers having to make split-second, utilitarian life-and-death decisions, such as whether to crash into pedestrians or property to keep a car's driver safe. An expert insists that the computer strives to do neither because it's been programmed to adhere to Isaac Asimov's first law of robotics\u2014machines should never harm people or knowingly allow them to be harmed\u2014but like every other choice in life, this one is not entirely in the decision maker's control. Like other segments, this one evokes Clarence Darrow's line from \"Inherit the Wind\": \"Mister, you may conquer the air, but the clouds will stink of gasoline and the birds will lose their wonder.\"  Herzog makes a relaxed but alert guide throughout, using narration sparsely but memorably and letting us hear his offscreen voice asking questions, some of which seem merely prankish until you hear the answers. (When talking to a scientist who helped devise small, self-driving robot drones that can play football in teams, he asks if the most accomplished group of drones can out-think Brazil's team. The answer: no, not at the moment, but don't bet against them in 2050.)  The mosaic arrangement of material ensures that no one subject can be covered in detail\u2014the sum total sometimes plays like a very good themed edition of \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" but with a wickedly funny narrator\u2014and a couple of segments, notably one about a rehab clinic for gaming addicts, feel intellectually undercooked. The film is saved from mere competence by that Herzogian feeling, at once grandiose and self-deprecating. Herzog embodies the cliche about the performer who's so charismatic that he could read aloud from the phone book and still be mesmerizing. An early segment informs us that during the early days of online activity, there was a printed directory containing the names and contact numbers of every person using the Internet. This document, we are told, is basically a phone book. It's a good thing Herzog didn't pause the film to read aloud from it. If he had, the Internet would have exploded.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "A Gay Girl in Damascus: The Amina Profile", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "You know what they say: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The blog A Gay Girl in Damascus, which rose to international fame in 2011 before it was revealed as a hoax, was always too good to be true, from the start. It was supposedly written by Amina Arraf, a U.S. citizen living in Syria. She was a lesbian, out to her parents, and provided street-level perspective on the Syrian uprising. The combination of Middle Eastern politics, gender, and sexuality proved irresistible, perfect \u201cbait\u201d for a media hungry for \u201chuman interest\u201d stories (as though the fact that the Syrian people were being bludgeoned in the streets was not \u201chuman\u201d enough). A group of far-flung journalists (namely, Andy Carvin from NPR, and the guys from Electronic Intifada), as well as real Syrian activists, plus the U.S. State Department (sent on a wild goose-chase for Amina when she was allegedly kidnapped by the Assad regime), brought the hoax to light with a couple of simple fact-checks that should have been done at the get-go. Amina did not exist. The \u201cgay girl\u201d blog was actually written by Tom MacMasters, a white middle-aged guy from Georgia (the U.S. state). Advertisement \u201cA Gay Girl in Damascus: The Amina Profile,\u201d directed by Sophie Deraspe, is a compelling and insightful examination of this strange story, and it utilizes the cooperation of Sandra Bagaria, the Canadian woman who had been in a long-distance romantic relationship with Amina (even though the two had never met.) Bagaria tells her own story, but also conducts the various interviews with those who intersected with the fictional Amina. The reality of Sandra, that she was clearly a real woman who existed, was part of the reason the hoax was believed so wholeheartedly. Unlike \u201cCatfish,\u201d which felt like little more than an amateurish directorial stunt, \u201cThe Amina Profile\u201d digs into the implications of such a hoax, both emotional and (in this case) political. The film works in a dreamlike fashion, opening with erotic texts between Amina and Sandra, all as two women in silhouette disrobe slowly, facing one another. Deraspe takes a non-literal approach to the material and it works beautifully, since this is, after all, a story about a collective belief in a fantasy. There are plenty of talking-heads, but the interviews are interspersed with a collage of images, pulling us into the fictional world MacMasters set up. One of the images repeats: A girl walks through the narrow streets and alleys of Damascus, the camera following her, her face never shown. She is a cipher, a faceless figure. She is courageous, she is frightened, she is eager, she is hopeful. She is whatever we want her to be. The visual choices Deraspe makes are effective because one of the experiences of a hoax such as this is that people are drawn into the fiction, as though into a dream. The \u201cgirl\u201d figure walking away from us, is Lewis Carroll\u2019s white rabbit, beckoning Alice further and further into the dreamworld. Who was Tom MacMasters? Why would someone do this? What need was he expressing? The time-commitment alone required for such a hoax is immense. Does he have remorse? Does he understand what he has done? Is he still out there, creating another online persona? \"The Amina Profile\" is interested in every level of this complex emotionally-fraught story. This is not just the story of the \u201ccatfishing\u201d of Sandra Bagaria. Everyone was catfished. The moment human beings had the ability to interact purely remotely, the desire of some to create fake online personalities (complete, usually, with trauma/disease/constant high drama) proved irresistible. There are too many examples to list, and, except for the emotional havoc wreaked on those who believed they were interacting with a real person, the results are relatively localized. Throngs of people were taken in by the tragic adventures of \u201cKaycee Nicole\u201d, a young girl with leukemia, before it was revealed that the entire thing was a fiction. Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te\u2019o, more recently, became a media darling because he was devoted to a dying girlfriend, who turned out to be a hoax. Munchausen by Internet is a phenomenon with a million horrible stories attached to it. The cautionary tales proliferate. Don\u2019t believe everything you read on the Internet. People are not who they say they are. These stories are also a critique of our feel-good culture, our love of stories that are \"uplifting.\" We all become dupes in such an unthinking environment.\u00a0 Advertisement A Gay Girl in Damascus was similar to these, but different in its scope. While the media was eagerly covering the Gay Girl, real stories of real people in Syria were not being covered. The Gay Girl hoax was used by the Assad regime to discredit the real activists in brutal ways. It was not a victimless hoax. Rami Nakhla, a Syrian activist, tears up at one point, talking about a friend of his from Syria, also gay, also imprisoned, but no one was talking about her at all.\u201cThe Amina Profile\u201d questions the appeal of \u201chuman interest\u201d stories, especially when they take precedence over real news. Because isn\u2019t any story a \u201chuman\u201d story, since it involves human beings? Why did it take a fictional \u201cgay girl\u201d in Damascus to get people interested? One of the byproducts of \u201cThe Amina Profile\u201d is that it celebrates those who maintain their critical thinking skills, who refuse to get swept away by a heartwarming narrative. Nobody thanks those people in the moment. On the contrary, they are met with outrage and hurt. How dare you question this wonderful story that makes us all feel good about ourselves? In response to Tom MacMaster\u2019s statement that along with practicing his \u201cconversational writing skills\u201d he wanted to \u201cgive voice\u201d to the real people on the ground in Syria, one of the Syrians interviewed shot back sharply, \u201cWe have voices. We can speak for ourselves, thank you very much.\u201d That's the real point.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Second Mother", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "A fair to large number of the contemporary Brazilian films\r\nthat make their way to United States distribution deal with social inequities\r\non a large and harrowing scale. The frantic, violent 2002 \u201cCity of God\u201d is a\r\npertinent example, as are the hyper drug-busting \u201cElite Squad\u201d pictures.\r\nWriter/director Anna Muyleart examines class and income difference in a much,\r\nmuch quieter register in \u201cThe Second Mother,\u201d a domestic comedy-drama that\r\nstarts off from a fairly pat premise but builds strength over the course of its\r\ncareful, empathetic, and crafty unpeeling of its characters.  Advertisement Regina Cal\u00e9 plays Val, a spirited if frumpy middle-aged\r\nwoman who\u2019s worked for a well-off Sao Paolo family for over a decade. In that\r\ntime she\u2019s become practically a second mom to now-teen Fabinho (Michel\r\nJoelsas). She\u2019s practically a co-conspirator with the kid. After his parents,\r\nhaute-bohemians Barbara (the imperious bossy parent, played by Karine Teles)\r\nand Carlos (the laid-back failed artiste inheritor of a family fortune, played\r\nby Louren\u00e7o Mutarelli) upbraid Fabinho for having a stash of pot (they\u2019re avid\r\nsmokers themselves of course), Val assists him in retrieving it from the trash.\r\nIt\u2019s all cozy enough in its way, especially as Barbara and Carlos, the better\r\nto assuage their liberal guilt, make something of a show of treating Val as\r\n\u201cfamily.\u201d\n\r\nThis practice is put to the test when a figure from Val\u2019s past calls. Val, as\r\nit happens, left the Northern part of Brazil for Sao Paolo with something\r\nbehind her: a child of her own, J\u00e9ssica, whom she entrusted to relatives when\r\nshe went to work for something like a living. J\u00e9ssica (the great Camila\r\nM\u00e1rdila) is now a teen, and about to apply for university in Sao Paolo. She\u2019s\r\nseeing her mother for the first time in a long time, and the resourceful,\r\nsmart, appealing girl is put off right away by her mother\u2019s insistence that she\r\nmove into her employer\u2019s house with her. Given that J\u00e9ssica is attractive,\r\nresourceful, smart, and aspires to a form of independence, one can expect all\r\nmanner of sparks to fly. And they do.  The tensions between servant and master are evident before\r\nJ\u00e9ssica arrives, revealed in Barbara\u2019s barely-held in, snobbish reaction to a\r\ncoffee set Val presumes to give the family as a gift. Once J\u00e9ssica arrives, she\r\nat first knocks out her mom\u2014\u201cThe Internet...You can do that?\u201d Val exclaims on\r\nseeing her daughter\u2019s web savvy in action\u2014then confuses her with her dedicated\r\nstudying: \u201cThe whole day with a book, it\u2019s easy to go crazy.\u201d J\u00e9ssica\u2019s\r\ninsistence on taking the family at their word about her and her mom\u2019s equality\r\nin their eyes is a test of Barbara\u2019s already clearly-limited patience. At the\r\nsame time, Carlos sees in J\u00e9ssica a liveliness and adventurous spirit that\u2019s\r\nnow dead in him, and this leads him to make some extreme pronouncements that\r\nanimate some of the most awkwardly funny scenes in the film. As the movie goes\r\non, J\u00e9ssica gets increasingly fed up with her mother\u2019s willingness to be\r\npatronized and humiliated by her employers. As various pushes come to shove,\r\nJ\u00e9ssica\u2019s compelled to share a secret with her mom that brings them closer even\r\nas it illustrates what some might see as an unfortunate pattern.

{"Title": "Hail, Caesar!", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "It\u2019s been some time since Joel and Ethan Coen have made a\r\nfull-out comedy. The producing, writing, and directing (and editing, too,\r\nalbeit under an assumed name) brother team\u2019s last three films, \u201cA Serious Man,\u201d\r\n\u201cTrue Grit,\u201d and \u201cInside Llewyn Davis,\u201d certainly haven\u2019t lacked for funny\r\nmoments. But \u201cMan\u201d was an apocalyptic riff painted on two inches of ivory,\r\n\u201cTrue Grit\u201d a rousing adventure that gradually mutated into a memory play about\r\nloss and mortality, and \u201cLlewyn Davis\u201d was at least in part a deeply sad story\r\nof inescapable existential failure. In other words, pretty heavy s**t. Their\r\nnew film, \u201cHail Caesar!\u201d is an exhilarating switchup: A comic fable that\u2019s both deftly clever and\r\nirrepressibly goofy. It is also, from stem to stern, the sweetest and sunniest\r\nfilm the Coens have ever made. Although you might not guess that from its\r\nopening shot, of a sculpture of a crucified Christ figure in a Catholic church.\r\nBear with me.  Advertisement Set in an unspecified period in 20th-century\r\nHollywood some time between the end of World War II and \u2026 well, certainly before\r\n1960, although the movie is meticulously determined in certain ways to be as\r\nahistorical as possible, \u201cHail Caesar!\u201d depicts 28 or so hours in the life of\r\none Eddie Mannix, played here with a beautiful combination of no-nonsense\r\ngruffness and tortured tenderness by Josh Brolin. The Coens took the name of\r\ntheir character from the real-life name of one of the more villainous figures\r\nin backstage Hollywood history (he was played by Bob Hoskins in the much darker\r\nTinseltown riff \u201cHollywoodland\u201d), but this entirely fictional Mannix is a\r\nharried ordinary-joe exec, \u201cHead Of Physical Production\u201d for a studio called\r\nCapitol Pictures. Capitol churns out conscientiously produced but hopelessly\r\nschlocky big pictures in a variety of genres, from Biblical epics to cornball\r\noaters.\u00a0 On this day in the life, Mannix has a number of big problems to contend\r\nwith. The front office wants Mannix to \u201cpromote\u201d singing cowboy Hobie Doyle\r\n(Alden Ehrenreich) from B-western star to romantic comedy leading man, much to\r\nthe confusion of the eager-to-please Hobie himself, and the consternation of\r\nhis new, exacting director, self-styled studio auteur Laurence Laurentz. The\r\naquatic musical star DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is newly pregnant,\r\nwhich is making her mermaid costume painful to wear, and on top of that, she\u2019s\r\nnot sure if she\u2019s interested in marrying the father of her child, a refusal that would constitute a potential PR gaffe for a studio that prides itself on an All-American image. A pair of twin gossip columnists (both played by\r\nTilda Swinton) are demanding answers to awkward questions and threatening to go\r\npublic with an awkward story about the studio\u2019s biggest matinee idol, Baird\r\nWhitlock (George Clooney). Finally, and most crucially, Whitlock himself has\r\nbeen kidnapped from the set of his Biblical epic, by a group of disgruntled Communist\r\nscreenwriters who call themselves \u201cThe Future\u201d in their terse ransom note. In\r\nthe meantime, Mannix must deal with his personal demons: he\u2019s a devout Catholic\r\nwho almost compulsively goes to confession, much to the exasperation of his\r\notherwise kindly and indulgent confessor. He frets over having told his loving\r\nwife that he\u2019s going to quit smoking, and then sneaking some cigarettes during\r\nhis stress-filled day. He\u2019s also being aggressively courted by a recruiter from\r\nLockheed, who tempts Eddie with a vested position, the promise of saner hours,\r\nand the chance to involve himself with something \u201cserious.\u201d How serious? This\r\ncharacter shows Eddie a shot of a recent H-bomb test at Bikini Atoll. \u201cLockheed\r\nwas there,\u201d he intones. You can tell this character is the devil because he\r\nalways offers Eddie a cigarette when they meet.  The Coens being the Coens, they cannot, or rather do not,\r\nresist the temptation to take what were and remain serious matters\r\nnot-terribly-seriously; in their funhouse mirror mashup of 1950s Hollywood, the\r\nostensible Red Scare was no \u201cscare\u201d at all but rather a Cold War component in\r\nwhich a big Hollywood star might conceivably defect to play \u201cSoviet Man\u201d for\r\nMosfilm. Once in the hands of his kidnappers, the amiable but boneheaded Whitlock\u2014poor\r\nGeorge Clooney, playing his fourth idiot for the Coen Brothers, is stuck in a\r\ngoofy Roman Centurion costume and haircut for the whole movie\u2014is instructed in\r\nMarxist logic by no less a personage than Dr. Herbert Marcuse himself. (Okay,\r\nhe\u2019s only referred to as \u201cProfessor Marcuse,\u201d but actor John Bluthal is made up\r\nto look like the actual figure.) All this cockeyed revisionist history may\r\ninspire scary thoughts of Steven Spielberg\u2019s (ostensibly) disastrous 1979 comedy \u201c1941.\u201d And to tell you the truth, there is more than a bit of broad,\r\nblithely unserious japery at play here. One also recalls \u201cThe Hudsucker Proxy\u201d\r\nand the Sam Raimi-directed, Coen-Brothers-co-written \u201cCrimewave.\u201d But the Coen\r\nBrothers have funnier jokes than Spielberg did, and they also know their real\r\nstuff at an almost dangerous level\u2014in the new commentary to \u201cInside Llewyn\r\nDavis\u201d on the Criterion Collection disc, writers Robert Christgau and Sean\r\nWilentz marvel at a throwaway Max Schactman reference in the movie that flew\r\nover the heads of 99 44/100th percent of viewers, and here they\r\npresent an American Communist Party membership card replete with a Gus Hall\r\nsignature.  Advertisement You can miss or ignore so many of these details and still\r\nenjoy the exquisite clockwork mechanism of the movie\u2019s plot, and/or the various\r\npastiches of old movies it offers up in differing manifestations. The goofily,\r\ncluelessly homoerotic \u201cNo Dames\u201d musical number, starring a game-as-always\r\nChanning Tatum, is a highlight, as is the near-pornographic whale-spouting imagery\r\nof the Busby-Berkeley-inflected Johansson-showcasing water ballet. (Around the\r\ntime of \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d I asked the Coens if they were influenced by the\r\nTechnicolor musical films of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, and they\r\nwere characteristically cagey in response; here they acknowledge their fandom\r\nby scoring the water dance to a bit from Offenbach\u2019s \u201cTales of Hoffmann.\u201d) The\r\nmovie\u2019s performances are all spectacularly rewarding, but Ehrenreich\r\npractically steals the picture as the completely ingenuous singing cowboy who\r\nain\u2019t quite as dumb as he seems, not by a long shot.  The movie makes light of the dialectic as explained to Baird\r\nby Marcuse, but it also, in its tricky way, continually invites/compels the\r\nviewer to use it. Eddie Mannix is a good man who is very good at his job\u2014but\r\nhis job seems to be manufacturing schlock. People enjoy schlock, but schlock is\r\narguably an agent of The People\u2019s oppression, so \u2026 anyway, one needn\u2019t go on.\r\nSuffice it to say that in the cosmology of the delightful \u201cHail Caesar!\u201d,\r\nregardless of the conclusions to which dialectical thinking may lead,\r\nacceptance is the key, and Hollywood,\r\nwhile \u201cproblematic,\u201d is more a force for good than the military-industrial\r\ncomplex can ever hope to be. And, finally, doing the right thing is an instinct\r\nshared by both company men and singing cowboys, for whatever that\u2019s worth.", "Critic": "Gamma"}

The musician had a very conflicted view of the situation; having decided early in his career that rock and roll was in some respects a suitable genre for what he wanted to accomplish musically, he embraced\u2014sort of\u2014the publicity-garnering tools that freak anti-popstar status afforded him. The movie kicks off with a clean-cut Zappa appearing on the Steve Allen show (the clip is readily available on YouTube and such, but looks better here) \u201cplaying bicycle.\u201d For Zappa, hitting the spokes of a bike tire for percussion was part of a modernist musical vocabulary\u2014his longtime model, Edgard Var\u00e8se, incorporated fire sirens and other unusual instrumentation in his work. For folks watching Steve Allen on televisions, it was, perhaps, weird. And so it went.\u00a0 \n The interview footage with Zappa from the early period is largely delightful\u2014in the back and forth with his interlocutors (one of whom includes folk singer Theodore Bikel, some years before Zappa recruited him for his movie \u201c200 Motels\u201d) he displays terrific comic timing, and he uses words like \"spiffy.\" And, this being the 1960s, everyone\u2019s clothes are ridiculous. At one point he talks about his formative influences, and imagines trying to establish \u201cthe missing link between Var\u00e8se, Stravinsky, and Webern.\u201d Soon there\u2019s some footage of a relatively early version of Zappa\u2019s band, The Mothers Of Invention, playing an all-instrumental version of \u201cMiddle Of The Night\u201d and the theme of \u201cUncle Meat\u201d and the missing link is there. Not only that, but the template for groundbreaking progressive rock bands such as Henry Cow is laid out in full. Exciting stuff.\u00a0 \n The movie proceeds chronologically, and Zappa\u2019s social commentary sometimes devolves into a kind of truculence, although it\u2019s difficult to argue, for instance, with his assertion that America\u2019s education system has nothing to do with \u201cpreparing people to live a life that has beautiful things in it.\u201d As the movie enters the period in which the scatological content of his lyrics rose considerably, Zappa the interviewee seems to become increasingly unaware of the extent to which his own work was becoming deeply reactionary. Watching him contemptuously dismiss the likes of Devo for dressing funny (in the song \u201cTinseltown Rebellion\u201d) is deeply ironic on several levels coming from the guy who staged the cover art of \u201cWe\u2019re Only In It For The Money.\u201d\u00a0 His rants against \u201cAmerican stupidity\u201d are in certain respects spot-on, but they ignore the fact that a crucial part of his work stems from a deep love of American stupidity and/or impudence. This is the man who once instructed keyboardist Don Preston to play \u201cLouie, Louie\u201d on the Royal Albert Hall pipe organ. \n And on the other hand, his indignant common sense during the PMRC hearings is wholly admirable, and the interviews conducted during his last years are terribly poignant. The workaholic Zappa notes in one exchange that he can now only manage to work from 9:30 AM to 6:30 PM on a good day. The movie put me on a major Zappa listening jag (one that, I have to admit, does not include \u201cSheik Yerbouti\u201d), which makes it sound like a fan-only proposition. It kind of might be, but I hope it isn\u2019t.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "November Criminals", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "This misbegotten movie, an ever-uneasy hybrid of teen angst tale and whodunit, begins with its hero/narrator Addison (Ansel Elgort) recounting his mom\u2019s death over misty-watercolored-memories home video footage. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at pretending to be okay,\u201d Addison tells us. And that\u2019s \u2026 fine, for a character we as yet have no real reason to be concerned about. Back in Addison\u2019s current day-to-day reality: he\u2019s a high-school senior, hyper intellectual, supposedly, and his best friend Phoebe (Chloe Grace Moretz), is the cool girl. Chatting about their impending college days in a car, Addison complains, \u201cI feel like you somehow see me as sexually neutral.\u201d Much to his own (and honestly, my own) surprise, Phoebe reacts to this by proposing a friends-with-benefits mutual de-virginizing. Hey! But first, a stop at a coffee shop in which it is briefly established that Addison has an African-American friend, Kevin (Jared Kemp),\u00a0even more hyper-intellectual than Addison (in their brief chat Kevin chides Addison for not yet having read James Baldwin). As Addison and Phoebe consummate their consummation in an under-white-sheets scene, a low-energy retread of a bit from Baz Luhrmann\u2019s \u201cWilliam Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo+Juliet,\u201d a guy on a motorcycle comes to the coffee shop and kills Kevin.\u00a0 Advertisement A shattered Addison goes into detective mode, worrying his dad (David Strathairn), annoying Phoebe\u2019s mom (Catherine Keener) and prompting the school principal (Terry Kinney) to suspend him. Addison\u2019s exploration of Washington D.C.\u2019s drug underworld is depicted in dicey, racist ways. When Addison, with Phoebe in tow, shows up at a drug den, its ostensible manager Bo looks Phoebe over and asks Addison if the girl is a present for him. Yeah, sure, Bo is a bad guy, but even as the portrayal of a bad guy this is a rank clich\u00e9 right out of D.W. Griffith. \u201cNovember Criminals\u201d is based on a 2010 novel by Sam Munson. According to reviews, in the book, Addison\u2019s braininess was conveyed by digressions in which the character expounded at length on Latin, Virgil, anti-Semitism, and more. Here Addison (himself a pot dealer in the book, but squeaky clean in that respect for the purposes of the movie) is supposed to be considered smart because of his anachronistic love of David Bowie. I presume this whittling down of the character to a single trait is the work of director Sacha Gervasi, who revised a script originally done by Steven Knight, who\u2019s not a perfect screenwriter but who has largely been proven to know better than to build personalities out of pop-culture referents. In any event, all of the personages in this slight movie are relatively one-note. It\u2019s a shame that actors as searching and scrupulous as Strathairn and Keener are so ill-used. Elgort seems at sea; as youthful as he looks, he hasn\u2019t a real clue about acting \u201chigh-school.\u201d Moretz is appealing as always, although there\u2019s not much for her to do other than look up pleadingly at Elgort, who\u2019s way taller. If you\u2019re ever hungry for a 12th\u00a0grade whodunit, Rian Johnson's\u00a0\u201cBrick\u201d remains your best entertainment value.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Caf\u00e9 Society", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "In both his work and his interviews, Woody Allen shows a\r\nquietly insistent cynicism (he would say \u201crealism\u201d) about the futility of human\r\nendeavor in a meaningless, godless universe, and stuff. There is one aspect of\r\nearthly existence for which he has a demonstrable soft spot, however, and that\r\nis The Past. Which is possibly the reason that his most recent films set there\u2014\u201cMidnight\r\nin Paris\u201d and this week\u2019s \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d\u2014are among the most beguiling in his\r\nongoing late work.  The opening image of \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d sets the tone: a\r\nbreathtaking shot of an impossibly clear-blue swimming pool at dusk, surrounded\r\nby elegant people in formal wear. Allen, production designer Santo Loquasto,\r\nand cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (the legendary camera maestro here\r\nworking, as is Allen, for the first time in the digital format, and knocking it\r\nout of the park) have a very particular vision of 1930s Hollywood, despite\r\nAllen\u2019s well-known and well-worn antipathy toward Los Angeles in general. It is\r\nhere, Allen tells us in his voiceover narration, that talent agent Phil Stern\r\n(Steve Carell), seen at poolside \u201cholding court\u201d before being interrupted by a\r\nphone call, is a major player and contented fat cat. The phone call is from his\r\nolder sister Rose (Jeannie Berlin), matriarch of a clan right out of Allen\u2019s\r\n1987 \u201cRadio Days,\u201d informing him that her youngest son Bobby (Jesse Eisenberg)\r\nis headed out to the West Coast, and that Phil should help set him up, despite\r\nthe fact that the energetic young man hasn\u2019t the faintest idea of what he wants\r\nto do.  Advertisement Speaking of \u201cRadio Days,\u201d Allen limns Bobby\u2019s family with\r\nthe same anecdotal detail that he used to such great effect in the older film.\r\nBobby\u2019s sister Evelyn (Sari Lennick) is married to a philosophical academic,\r\nwhile his older brother Ben (Corey Stoll) is an aggressive gangster. How all\r\nthis will come to bear on Bobby\u2019s adventures a whole continent away we have no\r\nidea, but Allen\u2019s discursive mode is not unpleasant, and it does in fact pay\r\noff, albeit in an oblique way.  As for Bobby himself, Eisenberg initially plays him as a\r\nyoung Allen stand-in, albeit a little more New York street-smart and self\r\ndetermined. Uncle Phil is so busy, and/or uninterested, in giving his nephew\r\nthe time of day that he doesn\u2019t see him for a week, during which time Bobby\r\ndecides, with long-distance encouragement from Ben, to sample the local\r\ncall-girl culture, leading to a \u201cDeconstructing Harry\u201d-reminiscent scene that\u2019s\r\none of the movie\u2019s few sour notes, Anna Camp\u2019s game efforts as an inexperienced\r\nprostitute notwithstanding. Once Phil does see the fellow, he makes him an\r\nerrand boy, and outsources overseeing his social life to agency secretary\r\nVeronica, or Vonnie, played by a luminous Kristen Stewart. Together they sample\r\nHollywood Mexican food, the edenic sands of Malibu, and ornate movie houses\r\nshowing pristine prints of Barbara Stanwyck movies. What a paradise it seems,\r\nexcept that Bobby falls hopelessly in love with Vonnie and Vonnie\u2019s got a\r\nmysterious boyfriend. One who\u2019s almost never around because, for one thing,\r\nhe\u2019s a married man, and for another\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t want to give anything away, but if you don\u2019t\r\nsee what\u2019s coming, you haven\u2019t seen many Woody Allen films. While predictable\r\nin certain respects, \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d surprises in others, one of which is the\r\n\u201clife goes on\u201d swerve it makes midway through, one by which, among other\r\nthings, its title is justified. Bobby and Vonnie\u2019s separate lives see Bobby\r\ntaking over management of a swank New York nightclub owned by his gangster\r\nbrother and Vonnie becoming a Hollywood wife. That they never really got over\r\neach other is the theme of the movie\u2019s languid, lyrical and sad final third.  When I saw \u201cIrrational Man,\u201d Allen\u2019s film prior to this, in\r\n2015, it occurred to me that Allen has achieved something I never would have\r\npredicted, and he himself might have never dared hope: he is, at this point in\r\nhis career, a better director than he is writer. The plot twists and dialogue\r\nof \u201cIrrational Man\u201d were familiar to the point of near-hoariness, but Allen\u2019s\r\nwork with his actors, his shot selection and his pacing were supple and fleet,\r\nand made the movie more effective than it would seem to have had the right to\r\nbe. \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society\u201d has sharper writing than \u201cIrrational Man\u201d (although the\r\nlongtime Allen follower will hear more than one recycled gag, including one\r\nfrom, of all pictures, the 1967 \u201cCasino Royale\u201d), and when it doesn\u2019t, his cast\r\nis motivated enough to bring it off; as tired as the movie\u2019s already oft-quoted\r\nline about life being written by a \u201csadistic comedy writer\u201d is, Eisenberg makes\r\nit work in context. (Eisenberg\u2019s performance here, by the way, is one of his\r\nbest in a while. After the one-two punch of \u201cEnd of the Tour\u201d and \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d I almost expected to never enjoy his work again, but he does some\r\npretty special things here; his reaction to seeing Vonnie again, unexpectedly,\r\nafter a long time apart, is one of them.)  Advertisement But it\u2019s the filmmaking around the writing that casts a\r\nparticular spell. Particularly near the end, as Allen adds up the moral\r\nfailings and squelched desires and doused dreams of all his characters. (The\r\ndirector provides voiceover narration throughout, and while his timing and\r\ninflection are on point as ever, his voice is frail, weakening; for the first\r\ntime in a film, he sounds like the person he is, an 80-year-old man.) And then\r\nhe wraps the whole thing up at a New Year\u2019s celebration that\u2019s as visually\r\nbeautiful as the pool party at the film\u2019s opening but is at the same time\r\ninfused with a powerful but still wistful cinematic incense of paradise lost.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Finding Vivian Maier", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "In the opening scenes of Jeff Maloof and Charlie Siskel\u2019s \u201cFinding\r\nVivian Maier,\u201d its titular subject is described as \u201cparadoxical\u201d, \u201cbold\u201d, \u201ceccentric\u201d,\r\nand other words that get at the fact that the men and women who were closest to\r\nMaier in her time on Earth didn\u2019t really know much about her. In 2007, Maloof\r\nwas working on a book about his Chicago neighborhood and longed for the right\r\narchival photography. A flea market junkie from a young age, he took a risk at an auction,\r\nbidding on a box of negatives that he never ended up using and shoved in a\r\ncloset. Two years later, he developed them out of curiosity and discovered a\r\nwoman now considered one of the best photographers of the 20th\r\ncentury. When the best of Maier\u2019s work first appears in the film about her, the\r\nquality takes your breath away and sends chills down your spine. She was a true\r\ntalent. And yet Maloof and Siskel\u2019s film presents an interesting moral quandary along with its profile of an amazing photographer. When does creative ability and the desire to share a true\r\nartist\u2019s eye trump what has to be considered an invasion of privacy? Advertisement The story of \u201cFinding Vivian Maier\u201d progresses from Maloof\u2019s\r\nauction find to his scanning the developed photos into a Flickr account and\r\nrealizing that he wasn\u2019t alone in his assessment of Maier\u2019s talent. And so he\r\nwent after the rest of the story, trying not only to find the rest of the\r\nnegatives but Maier\u2019s back story, and how it impacted her photography.\r\nImmediately, significant questions haunted Maloof. Why did she never show her\r\nwork to anyone? Why did she shoot over 150,000 photos, most of them from a box\r\ncamera that she always carried around her neck and could surreptitiously use to\r\ncapture her subjects? And what\u2019s the point of taking so many photos if no one sees them? When Maloof discovers that Maier recently passed and is\r\nallowed access to her storage unit, a portrait of a hoarder becomes more\r\nclearly defined. She didn\u2019t just take 150,000 photos. She kept receipts for\r\ndecades, collected trinkets, stacked newspapers to the point that her floor sagged.\r\nShe rather quickly goes from \u201ceccentric\u201d to mentally ill, especially when\r\nstories of her relative disregard for many of the children she nannied come\r\ninto focus. (One family speaks about the photos she took when one of her wards\r\nwas hit by a car and the behavior turns to honest mental and physical abuse\r\nlater in life). She often gave fake names and some claim she used a fake\r\naccent. She wanted to be hidden, private, and reclusive. Just because she once\r\nlooked into selling photos doesn\u2019t change the mountain of behavior that\r\nsuggests that she saw her negatives and photos as something else to fill the\r\nstorage unit of memories. And now all of that is being torn down. The argument has\r\nbeen made that Maier\u2019s photos are fair game because she didn\u2019t destroy the\r\nnegatives. She didn\u2019t destroy ANYTHING. She kept receipts buried in trinkets in\r\nenvelopes in boxes. And the film raises the question of privacy regularly with\r\npeople who knew Maier commenting on how much she would have loathed this\r\ninvestigation into her life and Maloof wondering aloud if he\u2019s gone too far.\r\nSadly, the filmmakers brush it off by answering the question with their\r\nfascination with this odd, talented outsider artist. Curiosity is used an\r\nexcuse to invade privacy. Not good enough. If they had taken a strong stance and simply stated\r\nthat art is meant to be shared and displayed no matter the artist\u2019s wishes, I\r\nmight have actually agreed. But the invasive nature of \u201cFinding Vivian Maier\u201d\r\nis only briefly given lip service and never adequately handled (within the film\u2026the\r\ncreators supposedly have dealt with the issue elsewhere but this is a review of what\u2019s in the film\r\nitself and not supplemental material). Advertisement Is it possible to love the art but disagree with the way it\u2019s\r\npresented? Vivian Maier\u2019s photography is absolutely incredible and now that it\u2019s\r\nbeen unearthed and her past has been investigated, her talent should be\r\nappreciated. And so I\u2019m incredibly torn about \u201cFinding Vivian Maier\u201d overall. Should\r\nMaloof and Siskel have opened a door that a dead woman so clearly wanted\r\nlocked? I\u2019d say no (or they should have done so with more authority and\r\nartistic justification instead of just glossing over the issue with \"But isn't she interesting?\"). And yet now that\r\nit\u2019s open, it can\u2019t be closed again. Perhaps when Maloof posted those photos on\r\nFlickr, there was no turning back. And oh is it ever fascinating what is behind that door.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Jack Reacher: Never Go Back", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) isn\u2019t a talky fellow. He\u2019s a loner with no middle name and no fixed address. He lives in fleabag motels, gets around by hitchhiking, and tends to communicate with his fists, though only after repeated warnings have failed. He is not, to put it mildly, father or husband material.  So of course \u201cJack Reacher: Never Go Back,\u201d based on Lee Child\u2019s novel, has the bright idea of outfitting Jack with a makeshift nuclear family consisting of a female Army major, Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders), who\u2019s had a bloody conspiracy wrongly pinned on her, and a teenage girl named Samantha Dayton (Danika Yarosh), who might or might not be Jack\u2019s daughter by a previous dalliance. This is the kind of setup that Clint Eastwood might\u2019ve handled with aplomb back in the day\u2014in fact, Eastwood\u2019s early masterpiece \u201cThe Outlaw Josey Wales,\u201d tells a thematically similar story about a loner who acquires a \"family\"\u2014and although Cruise is diminutive compared to Eastwood, he does a credible version of Clint\u2019s squint and hair-trigger lethality. His performance tries to delve deeper than the film will allow. We get a sense, more from watching Cruise than from any of the forgettable dialogue the character\u2019s been given, that Jack inflicts violence because it\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s really good at; that it may in fact be his only form of cowardice\u2014a means of running away from adult responsibilities\u2014and that he has no idea what to say to a romantic partner or a child during quiet moments.  Advertisement It\u2019s a pity that \u201cJack Reacher: Never Go Back\u201d fails to support Cruise and his co-stars, all of whom are acting as if their lives depended on it. There\u2019s a great movie buried somewhere in here\u2014a strange but beguiling family comedy and a meditation on nature vs. nurture, with a bit of shooting and punching thrown in\u2014but the filmmakers never figure out how to excavate it. There\u2019s a touch of 1980s Hong Kong action cinema in the way that director Edward Zwick and his co-writer Marshall Herskovitz (rewriting Richard Wenk\u2019s script) juxtapose bone-breaking fisticuffs with deadpan-goofy scenes where Jack and Susan\u2014who\u2019s basically a female Jack, with the same anger-flexing jawline\u2014struggle to protect and half-assedly parent Samantha as the trio runs from city to city, fending off assassins and trying to clear Susan\u2019s name. But Zwick doesn\u2019t have the Hong Kong wildness required to pull off that kind of film. He\u2019s an intelligent director, but too earnest and careful for material like this. There are a handful of genuinely funny moments in which Jack, Susan and Samantha\u2014a street-tough kid whose mom was a prostitute and drug addict\u2014fall into the familiar \u201cFather Knows Best\u201d patterns even though they\u2019re holed up in a New Orleans hotel while trying to get to the bottom of an Afghanistan-based arms smuggling operation run by a Halliburton-type military contractor. None of them have experience behaving within a traditional mother-father-child configuration, so they\u2019re a bit like actors who\u2019ve been thrown into a play without benefit of having read the script and are forced to improvise, badly. Susan and Samantha\u2019s version of mother-daughter bonding includes a tutorial on how to wrench a gun from a man\u2019s hands and kick him in the testicles. When Samantha sneaks out without permission one night, Jack and Susan confront her when she returns, and Jack half-sputters, \u201cWhere were you?\u201d The sight of two skull-cracking soldiers failing to control a teenage girl is a good joke, and remarkably, it never gets old. Unfortunately, it never becomes something other than a joke, or an undeveloped notion. The movie is filled with undeveloped notions, as well as scenes that might\u2019ve been dazzling, or at least clever, if Zwick and Herskovitz had been able to settle on a tone and a vision and develop them. Instead they march along with mild enthusiasm but no gusto, alternating dry-but-not-dry-enough comedy with action scenes that are competently executed but nowhere near as inventive and stirringly perverse as the best stuff in the original \u201cJack Reacher,\u201d a likewise pretty-good military conspiracy thriller enlivened by Cruise\u2019s junkyard dog sourness, a campy villain performance by Werner Herzog (who has no equivalent here, alas), and a couple of brilliantly staged, close-quarters fights.  Advertisement Zwick (who has told many military-themed stories, including \u201cCourage Under Fire\u201d and \u201cGlory\u201d) and Herskovitz (who teamed with Zwick on a series of great domestic dramas for TV, the best of which was \u201cMy So-Called Life\u201d) can\u2019t seem to decide if they want to lightly parody the subgenre of \u201cburned-out killer rejuvenated by love\u201d or embrace it without apology, even if it means alienating fanboys who are uncomfortable with any display of emotion that doesn\u2019t involve Cap and Bucky. This confusion manifests itself in the film\u2019s penultimate scene, a fated goodbye between Jack and Samantha that might\u2019ve been heartbreaking had the filmmakers ended it thirty seconds earlier.  Cruise does some of his career-best acting in this scene; you can see Jack struggling to make his face and voice do what any natural father\u2019s would do automatically, and failing miserably, because he\u2019s either not wired that way or lacks the life experience required to fake it. There are moments where Cruise\u2019s work here evokes Kurt Russell in \u201cSoldier,\u201d which is one of the best lead performances I\u2019ve seen in a movie that was just barely OK. There\u2019s fine supporting work by Aldis Hodge as a military police officer, Holt McCallany as an officer who\u2019s up to no good, and Patrick Heusinger as an assassin who\u2019s known only as The Hunter, and whose black trenchcoats and hipster facial hair suggest a Eurotrash cousin of Ryan Gosling. Smulders has a number of strong moments, too\u2014and she drives home the idea of Susan as a female Jack by delivering stinging rebukes in a very Cruise-y \u201cA Few Good Men\u201d cadence\u2014but she, too, is left to wander between the winds. There is nothing terrible about this film, yet it fails everyone involved with it. That\u2019s the kind of magic trick that you don\u2019t want to see.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Free Fire", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "There was a period in the mid- to late 1990s when it seemed as if every other gritty independent film and a few studio wannabes were built around scenes where tough white guys smoke cigarettes, insult each other and launch into interminable monologues about some aspect of popular culture until an argument breaks out and everybody points guns at each other. This, unfortunately, has been the main legacy of Quentin Tarantino, whose first two hugely influential films \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" could be boiled down to that very description, provided that you disregarded everything else that made them distinctive and good.\u00a0 Advertisement What followed the release of those movies was the cinematic version of a land rush, with directors, screenwriters and actors racing each other to stake out arid little plots of earth where they could build secondhand versions of films that were themselves constructed from borrowed and stolen pieces of other films (and often made no secret of what had been lifted). Probably eighty percent of these knockoffs could have been retitled, \"Watch Me Do Something I Think Is Easy But That Really Isn't.\" \"The Boondock Saints,\" \"Reindeer Games,\" \"Phoenix,\"\u00a0\"Truth or Consequences, New Mexico,\" \"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead,\" \"2 Days in the Valley,\" \"American Strays,\" \"The Way of the Gun,\" \"Suicide Kings,\" \"8 Heads in a Duffel Bag\"\u2014I could go on, but then we'd be here all day, and I'd never get around to talking about Ben Wheatley's \"Free Fire,\" a Tarantinoid film that arrives just in time to mark the 25th anniversary of \"Reservoir Dogs,\" which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival back in 1992.\u00a0 \"Free Fire\" is neither the best nor the worst of the Tarantino wannabes; at its worst, it's tediously unoriginal, and at its best, it's funny and reasonably involving. Either way, its temporal distance from \"Reservoir Dogs\"\u2014a film it brazenly imitates, right down to the warehouse setting and the grandiose use of kitschy pop\u2014makes it noteworthy. So does its status as part of one of the most striking filmographies of recent years: that of Wheatley and his screenwriting partner Amy Jump, who made \"High Rise,\" \"A Field in England\" and 2011's \"Kill List,\" a superior foray into somewhat QT-like territory. The story begins with Stevo (Sam Riley) and Bernie (Enzo Cilenti) driving to a Boston warehouse to take part in a weapons deal that includes a couple of Irish Republican Army members, Chris (Cillian Murphy) and Frank (Michael Smiley). Two intermediaries involved in the deal, Justine (Brie Larson) and Ord (Armie Hammer), lead the group inside and introduce them to the chief weapons dealer, a smug, glad-handing, unfunny little jokester named Vernon, who of course is played by Sharlto Copley, an actor whose whole career seems to have been modeled on Hart Bochner's performance as Ellis the Yuppie cokehead in \"Die Hard.\" Vernon has three associates, Martin (Babou Ceesay), Harry (Jack Reynor) and Gordon (Noah Taylor).\u00a0 Advertisement The cast soon expands to include several additional characters, including a couple of assassins who shoot into the warehouse with rifles from outside. Hidden motives and grudges are exposed as factors complicating this arms deal, which should have been simple and brief but becomes a complete disaster, with the core group shooting at each other from behind pillars and scrap heaps and discarded machinery and tending to their own wounds and others'. There's a bit of subtext involving the financial crash and the general decline of old fashioned manual labor (as photographed by Laurie Rose, the warehouse and the surrounding buildings and docks have a post-apocalyptic feel), and of course a lot of the dialogue has to do with the expectation of honor among thieves and the collective realization that in situations like this, there isn't any. There's a hint of budding romance between Chris and Justine (the only woman in the movie) and a couple of twists that you might or might not see coming, mostly having to do with hidden motivations.\u00a0 That the actors all seem to be enjoying themselves goes a long way towards making \"Free Fire\" something other than a slog through played-out situations. Wheatley is a superb director with a strong sense of both geography and psychology, which means that, despite the film's overpopulated cast, you are never confused about where people are or what they're feeling at any given moment. Some of the actors make a strong impression\u2014in particular Noah Taylor, who has been leaning hard into the grizzled-character-actor thing and is developing a Harry Dean Stanton vibe; and Hammer, whose eloquent, self-deprecating handsomeness evokes Brad Pitt. And the more deranged touches elevate \"Free Fire\" beyond its familiar setup. I never imagined that a filmmaker would press John Denver into service as, basically, the Ennio Morricone of a modern spaghetti Western, and yet here we are, and damned if it doesn't work. All in all, though, this feels like a step backward for a director whose work has confounded and surprised more often than not. This is a relatively short feature that still feels too long, because once you realize that there's only one way that most of these relationships can resolve\u2014with one party or the other dying of gunshot wounds\u2014there isn't much for the viewer to do besides wait out the final credits and hope for some tasty character bits along the way.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Bite", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "\u201cBite\u201d is a low-budget body horror film complete with\r\nwarnings about having better friends and not marrying men you don\u2019t really\r\nlove. It\u2019s got echoes of \u201cThe Fly\u201d (and, more recently, \u201cContracted\u201d) embedded in\r\na story about a young woman scared of her future, until she doesn\u2019t really have\r\none anymore. At its best, and it gets pretty good after a really rocky start, \u201cBite\u201d\r\nis a clever gorefest with some creative twists and turns. It\u2019s one of those\r\nearly career horror entries in which the filmmakers don\u2019t quite nail the set-up\r\nor the landing, but the gooey center of the film works for those with a high\r\ntolerance for things that might make a majority of the population queasy. Advertisement Bride-to-be Casey (Elma Begovic) and her two friends Kirsten\r\n(Denise Yuen) and Jill (Annette Wozniak) are on a bachelorette party trip as\r\nthe film opens. Using found footage style, we see the girls on the beach, at\r\nclubs, in their rooms, etc. Clearly, Kirsten is the nicer of the two friends, while\r\nJill is a bit catty, and eager to film awkward, possibly even scandalous\r\nmoments. Right from the beginning, \u201cBite\u201d is drawn from the \u201ccautionary\u201d genre\r\nof horror films that teach us that if we would just never leave the safety of our\r\ncouches, everything would be OK. And if you\u2019re gonna be crazy enough to go all\r\nthe way out of the country for a bachelorette party, don\u2019t be stupid enough to\r\ngo off the beaten path. That\u2019s what the girls do one day, swimming in a\r\nbeautiful lagoon when Casey gets bit by something. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little bite,\u201d\r\nshe says. We know better. When Casey gets home, the poorly-drawn characters take\r\ncenter stage for almost long enough to sink the film. We meet Casey\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Jared\r\n(Jordan Gray), and her horrible soon-to-be mother-in-law (Lawrene Denkers).\r\nJared is the kind of two-dimensional character really designed purely as\r\nanother thing for Casey to worry about. When she returns from her trip, he\r\ngreets her with an antique high chair (he wants kids, she\u2019s not ready) and then\r\ngoes to work. The allegory of a young woman being pressured to have children by\r\na workaholic fianc\u00e9 with a horrible mother is so broad that it almost\r\napproaches parody, but not quite, so the film lingers in that in-between space for\r\na bit too long, in which we\u2019re not sure how seriously we\u2019re supposed to take\r\nthese caricatures. The acting in these early scenes is rough, and even the\r\nframing feels off. You can tell the filmmakers and performers are kind of\r\ntreading water until they get to the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d Any horror fan will tell\r\nyou, the set-up can often be more rewarding than the follow-through if it\u2019s\r\ndone well.  After the rocky first act, \u201cBite\u201d starts to find its\r\nfooting. The concept of pairing quarter-life crisis concerns with body horror\r\nstarts to click as Casey begins to notice the bite on her leg is, well, oozing\r\nand growing. There\u2019s also a bit of a sexual assault allegory in that we learn\r\nthat Casey woke up on the beach without her clothes or her engagement ring\r\nduring the trip, thinking that one of the guys she met there must have\r\nassaulted her. It's understandable that she\u2019s too traumatized and scared to respond to\r\nwhat\u2019s happening with her body. Advertisement And then \u201cBite\u201d gets crazy. Sure, there\u2019s vomiting pus, but as someone says in one of my favorite lines long after Casey\r\nhas gone full-Brundlefly, \u201cPeople always get sick after vacations.\u201d The movie\r\nclicks during a dream sequence of all things, as Casey is imagining a surprise\r\nparty of all of her friends shouting \u201cbabies, babies, babies\u201d as she gives birth\r\nto hundreds of insect eggs. It\u2019s a moment Cronenberg himself would have loved.\r\nAnd, from there, \u201cBite\u201d turns up the insanity. By the halfway point, Casey\u2019s\r\napartment is covered in egg sacs and her body is falling apart. And then people\r\ncome to check on her. The fact that anyone would walk into her cocoon-apartment\r\nand not just scream and run away stretches logic, although the film is arguably\r\nat its best when it embraces its own ridiculousness. At a certain point, it becomes clear that \u201cBite\u201d has\r\nbasically written itself into a corner, and it doesn\u2019t escape in a way\r\nthat really satisfies, but the bulk of the film is a creative, icky ride.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "American Violence", "Stars": 0.5, "Review": "Is the death penalty justified punishment or merely a perpetuation of a cycle of violence that has become so ingrained in American society that it can\u2019t be stopped? It\u2019s a theme commonly returned to in fiction and film, including the remarkably incompetent \u201cAmerican Violence,\u201d which pretends to be interested in exploring complex issues about how violence begets violence but is so poorly made that one has to push their way past so much amateurish filmmaking just to find an issue or two worth discussing. This is a bizarrely inept film, one that includes dialogue that most teenagers would have edited and a plot that strains credulity at every turn. There are plenty of true stories that one could use to shine a light on the arguable hypocrisy of a system that takes an eye for an eye, but \u201cAmerican Violence\u201d seems defiantly unconcerned with addressing the actual issues at play, delivering a generic crime thriller instead. And a bad one at that. Advertisement If you struggled with Denise Richards playing a nuclear scientist in \u201cThe World is Not Enough,\u201d you may equally have trouble buying her as Dr. Amanda Tyler, a renowned psychologist asked to speak to a man on death row named Jackson Shea (Kaiwi Lyman-Mersereau). The request to Dr. Tyler from Ben Woods (Columbus Short) is mere PR\u2014they want to say they spoke to him before considering a stay, but aren\u2019t that serious about the issue\u2014but Tyler takes it seriously. She sets up with Shea much like Clarice set up with Dr. Lecter in \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d right down to the standalone cell in the middle of the room. However, that\u2019s where the comparisons to Demme\u2019s masterpiece stop for director Timothy Woodward Jr., who isn\u2019t nearly interested enough in the doctor-psycho relationship. In fact, the structure of the film, in which we see Shea\u2019s life story in flashback, basically sidelines Richards for most of the film. Believe it or not, that\u2019s a complaint. Shea\u2019s story is as generic and predictable as you\u2019d expect it to be. It opens with him being abused by an uncle as a child; moves on to a criminal enterprise in which he and a buddy robbed doctors who were taking cash payments and then billing insurance companies; features him crossing paths with an even-tougher bad guy; gets a woman involved, of course; and even gets a sequence of prison rape and an evil warden (played with why-am-I-here nonchalance by Bruce Dern). It\u2019s one of those films in which even the flashbacks can\u2019t stay consistent. There\u2019s a scene between a tough guy that Shea robbed and some cops that can\u2019t really exist in Shea\u2019s flashback story to Tyler because he\u2019s not there.  The performances are uniformly bad from top to bottom in \u201cAmerican Violence,\u201d although one starts to feel sorry for the cast given the dialogue they\u2019ve been asked to deliver. Two favorites are \u201cWe\u2019re all just caged animals \u2026 with animal instincts\u201d and \u201cThe only reason you\u2019re still alive \u2026 is I haven\u2019t killed you yet.\u201d Shea\u2019s story just isn\u2019t interesting thematically or narratively, and the film\u2019s only bright spot comes when New England Patriots all-star Rob Gronkowski shows up as a tough guy. It\u2019s not that Gronk is particularly good (although he cuts a striking enough figure to buy him as a bodyguard) but at least it\u2019s something to stop the boredom. Then he\u2019s gone again and we\u2019re back to the clich\u00e9s and the pretension. \u201cAmerican Violence\u201d is one of those truly awful films that not only has nothing to say, but can\u2019t even be entertaining as B-movie pulp.

{"Title": "A Summer's Tale", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Critics frequently deemed the late French director Eric Rohmer (he died in 2010, at age 89) an \"arthouse favorite,\" but sometimes the American arthouse, or the exhibitors who serviced it, shunned him. In the 1990s, U.S. fans of Rohmer could enjoy only three of his \"Tales of Four Seasons,\" those set in Winter, Spring, and Autumn (the Autumn entry was singled out for particular praise, and to my recollection got the widest distribution). Rohmer didn\u2019t skip summer, but for some reason his tale of that season never made it here.  Advertisement Until now. The 1996 \"A Summer\u2019s Tale\" gets its official U.S. release today, and having a heretofore-unseen work by Rohmer in a movie theatre is as salutary as\u00a0basking in a ray of June sunshine. Like many of his later pictures, this is a story of the romantic foibles of some attractive, self-conscious, but hardly self-aware young adults. Rohmer had an almost uncanny knack for using the mercurial predilections of the young as a launching pad for smart but not oppressive philosophical observations. Here, he tackles the age-old question once articulated by the Loving Spoonful as \"Did You Ever Have To Make Up Your Mind?\" Gaspard (stick-thin, curly-haired Melvil Poupaud) arrives for his summer holiday at a beach town in the North of France, and doesn\u2019t do much of anything for a few days. Indeed, the movie itself unfolds at a remarkably languorous pace, title cards drolly marking the passing of days as shy Gaspard meets a cute waitress named Margot (Amanda Langlet, all grown up since she played the title girl in Rohmer\u2019s 1983 \"Pauline At The Beach\"), stays in his flat playing guitar, strolls on the beach and waits for a phone call. Hanging out with Margot, he discusses his enthusiasm for the music of the sea \u2014\"Two of the big trends at the moment are Celtic rock and sailor rock,\" he observes to her\u2014and she tells him of her studies in ethnology. Margot\u2019s attempts to draw Gaspard out make her seem flirtatious, but maybe that\u2019s not the case; in any event, Gaspard has a girlfriend, Lena, whom he was hoping to meet up with on this sojourn, but she seems to have lost the thread re their rendezvous. So, after rebuffing a tentative advance from the shy Gaspard, Margot encourages him to pursue the vivacious Solene (Gwena\u00eblle Simon), which he does, with no small success. (\"You might not think so but I do have principles,\" the bossy but game young woman assures him in one of the movie\u2019s more disarming exchanges.)\u00a0Gaspard's success seems to make Margot irritatedly jealous. And then, what else, Lena (Aurelia Nolin) saunters into town. Gaspard, who started his vacation with no love interest, now has three.  As Gaspard tries to juggle his girls, he fails to perceive that he\u2019s sinking into the quicksand of little white lies. And the more confident he gets, the more insufferable he becomes. Looking at the picture\u2019s mostly sun-drenched and drolly cheerful surface layer, one marvels at Rohmer\u2019s unerring sense of what drama kings and queens young people can be. But not too far below that surface is an ironic parable about how people, regardless of their age, use their romantic lives to construct their self-images. The deus ex machina that delivers Gaspard from having to face up to his mistakes (sort of) is both entirely apt and rather hilarious, and will resonate with contemporary hipsters and those who are familiar with them, despite the movie being almost 20 years old itself. Some tropes never go out of style.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "The Rover", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Much as Cormac McCarthy did in \"The Road,\" David Mich\u00f4d examines what would happen to society after a complete structural collapse in \"The Rover.\" What separates his film from the numerous what-if examinations of the genre known as post-apocalyptic is a focus on the human condition instead of setting. It\u2019s not just that supplies are limited and legal repercussions a distant memory, it\u2019s the question of how life goes on and what a world without basic commerce or laws does to mankind. It makes it tough. \"The Rover\" is a bleak, brutal film; at times, its monotony can be draining. Ably aided by the jarring chords designed by composer Antony Partos (not unlike the unsettling work by Jonny Greenwood on \"There Will Be Blood\") and cinematography by Natasha Braier that always places our characters in the context of a bleak landscape, Mich\u00f4d finds a tonal consistency in \"The Rover\" that makes its repetition forgivable, and even effective. It doesn\u2019t let up because it shouldn't let up.In an interesting screenwriting decision, the two major events that really drive the action of \"The Rover\" take place before the credits; a nod to the fact that this is a story about the aftermath of \"the collapse\" and not the collapse itself. Eric (a gruff, nearly dead-eyed Guy Pearce) walks into what I suppose is a bar in the middle of the outback. As with all establishments in \"The Rover,\" the few occupants are armed. Music blares. Eric sits. One gets the impression that he could sit there for hours. The relative \"peace\" of the moment is shattered when a truck carrying three men flips over outside. The trio\u2014Archie (David Field), Caleb (Tawanda Manyamo), and Henry (Scoot McNairy)\u2014find their vehicle upright but stuck. Since they have clearly come from something violent and dangerous (Henry has been shot), they need to move quickly. Archie smashes the window to Eric\u2019s car, hotwires it, and his two mates jump in. When Eric sees that his final possession has been stolen, he wrenches the truck from where it was stuck and pursues.Eric gains a potent ally in his quest to retrieve his car when he crosses paths with Rey (Robert Pattinson), Henry\u2019s brother. Rey was presumed dead and left behind by Henry in the firefight that took place before the crucial car swap. Rey is a little dim-witted, played by Pattinson as a series of ticks and stutters that could annoy some but I found effective. For one to believe that Rey would ally with someone like Eric, who is clearly going to kill Rey\u2019s brother, one needs to believe that Rey wouldn\u2019t ask too many questions. And that he would be crushed himself by being left behind by the one thing he had left in the world.While Eric and Rey may not seem likely travelling companions, they are two men whose final possessions in a world of increasing desperation have been stolen. For Eric, it was his car. For Rey, it was his brother\u2019s love. Mich\u00f4d wisely doesn\u2019t spend too much time defining the terms of his post-apocalyptic vision, allowing his characters and their needs to define it for him. And Pearce and Pattinson rise to the challenge, the former finding the soul of a man who can barely remember happiness\u2014it\u2019s the moments in which Eric starts to trust Rey that seem to startle him more than pain or violence\u2014and the latter conveying the desperation of a man who may not know a lot but knows he can\u2019t make it on his own. If his brother left him behind, he might as well partner with the man tracking him down.It\u2019s the images of \"The Rover\" that linger\u2014a truck flipping by a window, a man collapsing under the interrogation of another, a gun sale that ends in violence, the climax. Most of all, it\u2019s an image of two unlikely travelers walking down dusty roads, looking for any sort of societal structure, old-fashioned hope, or even just a night\u2019s sleep that isn\u2019t ended by a threat, but knowing with every step not just how much was lost in the collapse but that they still have to go on.

{"Title": "Coco", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "\"Coco\" is the sprightly story of a young boy who wants to be a musician and somehow finds himself communing with talking skeletons in the land of the dead. Directed by Lee Unkrich (\"Toy Story 3\") and veteran Pixar animator Adrian Molina, and drawing heavily on Mexican folklore and traditional designs, it has catchy music, a complex but comprehensible plot, and bits of domestic comedy and media satire. Most of the time the movie is a knockabout slapstick comedy with a \"Back to the Future\" feeling, staging grand action sequences and feeding audiences new plot information every few minutes, but of course, being a Pixar film, \"Coco\" is also building toward emotionally overwhelming moments, so stealthily that you may be surprised to find yourself wiping away a tear even though the studio has been using the\u00a0sneak-attack\u00a0playbook for\u00a0decades.    Advertisement The film's hero, twelve-year old Miguel Riviera (voice by Anthony Gonzalez), lives in the small town of Santa Cecilia. He\u2019s a goodhearted child who loves to play guitar and idolizes the greatest popular singer-songwriter of the 1920s and '30s, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), who was killed when a huge church bell fell on his head. But Miguel has to busk in secret because his family has banned its members from performing music ever since Miguel's great-great-grandfather left, abandoning his loved ones to selfishly pursue his dreams of stardom. At least that\u2019s the official story passed down through the generations; it\u2019ll be challenged as the film unfolds, not through a traditional detective story (although there\u2019s a mystery element to \u201cCoco\u201d) but through an \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d journey to the Land of the Dead, which the hero accesses through the tomb of his ancestors.\u00a0    Family and legacy as expressed through storytelling and song: this is the deeper preoccupation of \u201cCoco.\u201d One of the most fascinating things about the movie is the way it builds its plot around members of Miguel\u2019s family, living and dead, as they battle to determine the official narrative of Miguel\u2019s great-great grandfather and what his disappearance from the narrative meant for the extended clan. The title character is the hero\u2019s great-grandmother (Renee Victor), who was traumatized by her dad\u2019s disappearance. In her old age, she has become a nearly silent presence, sitting in the corner and staring blankly ahead, as if hypnotized by a sweet, old film perpetually unreeling in her mind.    The machinations that get Miguel to the other side are too complicated to explain in a review, though they\u2019re comprehensible as you watch the movie. Suffice to say that Miguel gets there, teams up with a melancholy goofball named Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), and has to pose as one of the dead with the aid of skeletal facepaint, but that (like Marty McFly returning to the 1950s to make sure his mom ends up with his dad in \u201cFuture\u201d) the longer Miguel stays on the other side, the more likely he is to end up actually dead.    Advertisement I\u2019m reluctant to describe the film\u2019s plot in too much detail because, even though every twist seems obvious in retrospect, Molina and Matthew Aldrich\u2019s script frames each one so that seems delightful and inevitable. Many of them are conveyed through a stolen family photograph that Miguel brings with him to the Land of the Dead. The deployment of the photo is a great example of how to tell a story through pictures, or more accurately, with a picture. Somebody\u2019s face has been torn out; there\u2019s a guitar that proves to be important later, and there are other ways in which visual information has been withheld from Miguel (and us) so that it can be revealed or restored when the time is right, completing and correcting an incomplete or distorted picture, and \"picture.\u201d What\u2019s freshest, though, is the tone and outlook of the film. \u201cCoco\u201d opened in Mexico a month before it opened in the USA and is already the highest grossing film of all time there. It assumes a non-American point-of-view on spirituality and culture\u2014not in a touristy or \u201cthought experiment\u201d sort of way, but as if it were merely the latest product of an alternate universe Pixar Mexicano that has existed for just as long as the other one. The film\u2019s stable of voice actors reads like a Who\u2019s Who of Latin-American talent: the ensemble includes Edward James Olmos, Alfonso Arau, Ana Ofelia Murguia, Alanna Ubach and, in a small role, to my surprise and astonishment, playwright Octavio Solis, who was one of my teachers in high school back in Dallas. Michael Giacchino's score is unsurprisingly excellent, as are the original songs\u2014in particular, the future Oscar winner \"Remember Me,\" the greatest tear-eruption mechanism to accompany a Pixar release since the \"Toy Story 2\" centerpiece \"When She Loved Me.\" Like most Pixar productions, this one is filled with homages to film history in general and animation history in particular. I was especially fond of the references to the dancing skeletons that seemed to pop up constantly in cartoon shorts from the 1930s. There\u2019s a touch of Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki in the film\u2019s matter-of-fact depiction of the dead interacting with the living, as well as its portrayal of certain creatures, such as a goofy, goggle-eyed dog named Dante (modeled on Xoloitzcuintli, the national dog of Mexico) and a gigantic flying dragon-type beast with the personality of a plump old housecat.  Advertisement Also notable are the film's widescreen compositions, which put lots of characters in the same frame and shoot them from\u00a0the waist up or from head-to-toe, in the manner of old musicals, or\u00a0Hollywood comedies from the eighties like \"9 to 5\" or \"Tootsie.\" The direction lets you appreciate how the characters interact with each other and with their environments and lets you decide what to look at. At first this approach seems counter-intuitive for a movie filled with fantastic creatures, structures and situations, but it ends up being effective for that very reason: it makes you feel as though you're seeing a record of things that are actually happening, and it makes \"Coco\" feel gentle and unassuming even though it's a big, brash, loud film.  I had some minor quibbles about \u201cCoco\u201d while I was watching it, but I can\u2019t remember what they were. This film is a classic.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "The Angriest Man in Brooklyn", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "I imagine that the title of this motion picture is going to spur a lot of obvious jokes from any number of New York-based film critics, so I\u2019ll exercise a little self-discipline and spare you my own. Unfortunately, this leaves me with very little else to say about this ineffectually maudlin motion picture, a remake of an Israeli movie called \"The 92 Minutes of Mr. Baum.\" Immediately upon being told the premise, most imaginative readers will be able to spin out a better version of the actual film in their heads: an aging professional, once contented but now \"Embittered After A Family Tragedy,\" is truculent with his doctor; said doctor then facetiously informs the man that he has only 90 minutes to live. Two things ensue: the bitter man embarks on a \"Trek Of Personal Redemption,\" and the guilt-ridden doctor chases the bitter man, because while the whole ninety-minute-to-live thing was a fabrication, the condition from which the bitter man suffers is real and requires treatment.  Advertisement Got it? Here are a few more filled-in blanks: Robin Williams plays the bitter man, and he\u2019s bitter because A) one of his sons died a little while back and B) the other son didn\u2019t want to join his law firm but preferred to teach ballroom dancing. Ten points if you guess the movie\u2019s climactic scenes have something to do with ballroom dancing. Williams, of course, has been doing a gruff-turns-to-lovable schtick as opposed to any organic acting for more than half of his motion picture career, so his work here is what one might call dreadfully predictable. He still retains a formidable reputation, so one can\u2019t blame Hamish Linklater for taking the part of the ballroom-dancing son, although there\u2019s nothing for that thankless role.  Mila Kunis, who co-executive produced, is surprisingly bland as the hapless and tetchy doc who\u2019s Williams\u2019 tormentor, and then comforter. Peculiarly, Kunis\u2019 character is portrayed as being the victim in an adulterous relationship with a fellow doctor played by Louis C.K. Other luminaries in the cast include Peter Dinklage as Williams\u2019 brother, Melissa Leo as Williams\u2019 wife and TV stalwart Bob Dishy as a neighbor. All of these capable-or-better performers are pretty much wasted in stock roles, as representatives of the kith and kin that Williams takes for granted as he rages against his life\u2019s losses by hating everyone. It all leads up to some very bad green-screen work depicting a dangerous traipse around the Brooklyn Bridge, and reaches a sort of epiphany with a view of a floating carousel. Yes. It is very much that kind of movie.  It is surprising that the directorial credit here goes to Phil Alden Robinson, who was also behind the rather more effective \"Field Of Dreams,\" and whose last feature credit was the Jack Ryan thriller \"The Sum of All Fears\" over ten years ago. I imagine that an update on the disposition of his career, and how it led him to a project such as this, might be more interesting and engaging than \"The Angriest Man In Brooklyn\" itself.", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Sing Street", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Writer/director John Carney, who directed the award-winning Irish musical \"Once\", returns to familiar territory with \"Sing\u00a0Street\", peppered with musical numbers, and in love with what music can unleash in its characters and audience. A song can \"take you back\" to specific moments in time, connecting you to a younger self, memories and dreams in a continuum. \"Sing\u00a0Street\" takes place in Dublin, 1985. The so-called Celtic Tiger is years in the future, and prospects for Irish kids look bleak. In the opening sequences, the Irish are shown emigrating to London in droves, seeking work and a hopeful future. That moment-in-time backdrop is essential to the wonderful \"Sing\u00a0Street\", a movie about escape, identity, dreams vs. reality, young love, and music (and because this is 1985, it's also about that new-fangled mind-blowing innovation called a \"music video.\") John Carney has a humorous and loving eye for detail, an intuitive ear for dialogue, and the film is extremely personal in a way that is universal. Advertisement There are pitfalls everywhere in a coming-of-age period piece like this one, but Carney avoids them easily, keeping the film on its proper track. It's extremely confident: It knows what it wants to be, what story it wants to tell. While \"Sing Street\" is often hilarious (in a darkly honest Irish way), it's also so full of heart that by the end you've seen a film where dreams really do mean something, where escape hatches exist, you just have to be bold enough and imaginative enough to take a chance. Taking a chance in \"Sing\u00a0Street\" means various things: starting up a band even though you don't play an instrument, wearing makeup even though you're a boy, walking across the street to talk to that pretty denim-clad girl you see every day on your way to school. \"Sing\u00a0Street\" never condescends to the yearnings, pain, and hopes of its main character, teenage boy Conor (played by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, so hugely talented it's hard to believe \"Sing Street\" is his debut), and, even better, believes in the dreams of every character in the film, even minor ones.\u00a0 The home life of Conor and his two siblings is not Dickensian by any means, but the vicious fights of their parents (played by Aidan Gillen and Maria Doyle Kennedy, both great in small roles) makes the tail-end of their childhoods like a prison sentence. Each sibling seeks escape from the household tension in their own ways. Older brother Brendan (Jack Reynor, a standout talent central to the film's success) holes up in his room with his weed and his impressive record collection. Older sister Ann (Kelly Thornton) devotes herself to her studies. Conor is lost in the shuffle after being yanked out of private school and tossed into the Synge Street public school, which is like throwing fresh meat to lions. The student body and the priests at Synge Street are so rough that the movie feels like it takes place in a maximum-security prison for the criminally insane. Conor picks up his own personal bully immediately, as well as a scrawny red-headed sidekick.\u00a0 At home, Conor and Brendan sit on the couch, watching music videos, Duran Duran pretty boys dominating. Conor can barely process the awesome-ness of what he sees, and Brendan takes on a mentor role, pontificating on the music business. Brendan is sunk in some lost dreams of his own, and one of his self-appointed roles in life is to teach his little brother the ropes. (\"Sing\u00a0Street\" is extremely accurate about the relationship between close siblings.) Conor, inspired, decides to start a band. He kind of sort of plays the guitar, and he's innocent enough to believe that his music might get him to England, like Duran Duran. He also thinks it might make him seem cool to Raphina (Lucy Boynton), the aforementioned intriguing denim-clad girl across the street. Successful careers have been started for less. (Johnny Carson once asked Fernando Lamas why he got into show business, and Lamas answered, \"To meet broads.\") Advertisement Putting together the band has the naive enthusiasm reminiscent of the punk-rock girls in the 2013 Swedish film \"We Are the Best!\". The bar for entering rock 'n' roll is pretty low; there are no entrance exams. Conor finds allies, one in particular with whom he forms a songwriting collaboration. Before they've found a gig, they decide to make a music video, and Conor asks Raphina to be in it. Shockingly (to him), she agrees.\u00a0 And with that, \"Sing\u00a0Street\" takes off. Dreams don't always line up with reality, and everyone (parents, siblings, the beautiful and complicated Raphina) learn that hard lesson. But sometimes reality is the dream: when a songwriter stumbles on the \"hook\" of a song, when a band made up of misfit strangers suddenly coalesce into a team, when the girl you love looks at you and shows you who she is. Dreams are fleeting, but we are nothing without the \"substance of things hoped for.\" The band develops, from a synth-pop sound, to a New Wave-ish aesthetic, as they try to figure out who they are. There are so many memorable sequences, quiet moments of growing connection between Conor and Raphina, the band's series of music videos, and a killer fight scene between Brendan and Conor. Brendan, watching his brother blossom, thinks maybe that he is about to be left behind. Who will he be without his role as dispenser-of-music history and provider of-courtship-tips to his little brother? As funny as the film is, John Carney infuses scenes with a poignancy bordering on deep blue melancholy. He is helped in this by the sensitive performance of Walsh-Peelo, required to run the gamut of emotions: hurt, fear, ambition, growing pains, first romantic feelings, a sense that the world is even more painful and scary than he had realized. It's a delight to watch the flickers of thought his eyes, his quiet listening face, the rising flush in his cheeks in moments of intensity. He's beautifully open as an actor.\u00a0 The surrounding cast is superb, both the broad stereotypes and the eccentric weirdos in the band. Adolescence is one of the most self-involved phases of life, and that's as it should be. Kids develop their characters and try on different identities, looking for a good fit. (Conor goes from dressing like Simon LeBon to Morrissey, and you get the sense he's just getting started.) One of the most essential elements of adolescence is finding like-minded friends: people who obsess about the same things, people who \"get\" you. Whether it be serious-jock baseball players (as in Richard Linklater's \"Everybody Wants Some!!\") or devoted music obsessives, it's the same goal: Find your people, find your own tribe.\u00a0 Advertisement There are openly crowd-pleasing scenes, and in this case that's not a criticism. The triumphs are satisfying, the barriers are frustrating and even heartbreaking, the sweeping connections, when they come, work on that primal level that gets underneath the skin, vibrates on a certain frequency.\u00a0The film works so well that when Carney's dedication comes on the screen right before the credits roll, it unleashes profound emotion because it's the anchor of what the film has been about all along, something felt throughout, but not underlined or spoken. \"Sing\u00a0Street\" has a good and generous heart, and it beats because of that dedication.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Guest", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"The Guest\" announces its intentions and style in the short opening  sequence. There's a close-up of a guy, shot from behind, running down an  empty road through a desert. He's wearing heavy military-style boots.  We don't see his face. Suddenly, with a blast of terrifying music, the  title screen comes, huge purple letters on a black background. The next  shot, accompanied by another alarming blare of scary music, shows a  horrifying-looking scarecrow, lording it over the desert landscape. In  three shots, director Adam Wingard announces what \"The Guest\" will be  all about, tells us what the film is. The opening  locates us easily and confidently in space, time, mood, and genre. \"The  Guest\" delivers on that initial promise. Advertisement David (\"Downton Abbey\"'s Dan Stevens) shows up unexpectedly on the  doorstep of the Peterson family, made up of parents (Sheila Kelley and  Leland Orser), a teenage daughter named Anna (Maika Monroe in a  fantastic performance) and grade-school-age son Luke (Brendan Meyer).  David announces himself at the door, quietly and politely, with his  gentle Kentucky accent, as a friend of their eldest son who had been  killed in combat. The Petersons, still reeling from grief, let the  stranger in. He is intense, but submissive, speaking quietly to each  family member, providing them with positive memories of their fallen  son, and within 24 hours he has been invited to move into the dead son's  old room. On the surface, David presents himself as an old-fashioned guy, with good  manners, eager to make himself useful to the grieving family. It is the  least he can do for his dead friend. He becomes a protector to young  Luke against the bullies at the boy's school, and Anna, fighting with her  own suspicions about this new \"guest,\" can't help but take notice of the  guy's blazing baby-blues and phenomenal body, glimpsed wrapped in a  towel in the hallway after his shower. The audience can sense immediately that David is not the lost lamb he  pretends to be; the opening sequence alone has already clued us in. But  \"The Guest\" takes its time revealing what is really going on, and has a  lot of fun in that slow reveal process. Director Wingard and his regular screenwriter collaborator Simon Barrett  are interested in genre mash-ups and the dramatic possibilities of  comedy-horror, as evidenced by their previous full-length feature  \"You're Next.\" \"The Guest\" goes even further in that direction. The  music (by Steve Moore) suddenly blasts throughout, with moments of  pulsing techno unease, as Anna, crouched in her bedroom decorated with  Goth-Girl skull-and-crossbones, desperately tries to figure out more  about the hot interloper, now sleeping in the room next door. Advertisement Thomas Hammock's production design adds to the camp flavor of \"The  Guest\", sometimes tipping over into blatant parody. The film takes place  in the weeks leading up to Halloween, and therefore the screen is  filled with Halloween decorations crowding in on every single scene from  the walls, the ceilings, the counter-tops. Even in quiet safe moments  sitting around the kitchen table, sharing tender memories, the  characters are leered at on all sides by jack-o-lanterns and black cats  and horrified ghosts. There's even a great scene in a Hall-of-Mirrors  Haunted House maze, echoing with disorienting demonic laughter. The mood  is both legitimately terrifying and hilarious. The second half of the film careens headlong into glorious paranoia and  conspiracy-theory, reminiscent of 1970s political thrillers, involving  gleaming board-rooms populated by stone-faced military brass, top-secret  briefcases, and world-class weaponry that even the military wouldn't  admit to developing. David's strangeness is apparent from the get-go,  but it's just the tip of the iceberg. None of this would work without Dan Stevens' fascinating and compelling  presence at the center. When he left \"Downton Abbey,\" after becoming an  old-school heartthrob as Matthew Crawley, the reluctant heir to the  great house, fans of the show howled in protest. Here, he shows his  versatility, something he had been itching to do during his years on  \"Downton Abbey.\" Stevens' accent is seamless, without even a hint of his  British origins, and he brings a gentleness and openness to the  character that manages to seem extremely \"off,\" as well as a truly  sinister undercurrent, something dead-eyed and remote. Wingard and Barrett have a perfect eye and ear for this type of  material. They have fun with their influences, paying homage to John  Carpenter and others. They're not afraid to be silly and bold. \"The Guest\" could  have drowned in top-heavy seriousness, while trying to make some  political point. But it's really not serious at all. That's a  compliment.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "In the Game", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Stan Mietus is the kind of role model that we all hope our\r\nchildren someday encounter in their lives. When we send our kids off to school\r\nor to athletic programs, we place an incredible amount of trust in the people\r\npaid to teach and coach them. Mietus understands, as clich\u00e9d as it sounds, that\r\nhe\u2019s teaching young people that it\u2019s really not whether you win or lose, but\r\nhow you play the game and how you respond to adversity that defines your\r\ncharacter. He\u2019s teaching teamwork, confidence, and, yes, that life is unfair.\r\nYou will lose in life, but it\u2019s how you respond that matters more than the\r\nlosing. Mietus is one of the central figures in Maria Finitzo\u2019s \u201cIn the Game,\u201d\r\npremiering at the Siskel Film Center tomorrow, August 22nd, with\r\nscreenings throughout the next week (go here for more details).\r\nIt\u2019s a project from Kartemquin Films, the brilliant people behind Steve James\u2019 \u201cLife\r\nItself,\u201d and the best sports documentary of all time, \u201cHoop Dreams.\u201d Much like\r\nthat film, Finitzo uses sports\u2014girls\u2019 soccer this time\u2014to comment on other\r\nissues, including income inequality and gender roles, but she does so with a\r\nlight tough, always keeping the focus on the players on the field more than the\r\nentire game.  Advertisement For four years, Finitzo and her crew went back to Kelly High\r\nSchool on Chicago\u2019s Southwest side, catching up with Mietus and the players on\r\nhis soccer team. The first of these young women we meet was up until 2am the\r\nnight before studying and woke at 4:30am for soccer practice, which takes place\r\nin the hall sometimes because there\u2019s not enough space in the gym and they don\u2019t\r\nhave a working field. It\u2019s a school that\u2019s 83% Latino and 86% below the poverty\r\nline. Over the course of \u201cIn the Game,\u201d we will watch young women forced to\r\nmake life\u2019s difficult decisions, often between school and work to help support\r\ntheir families. These are decisions made every day in major cities around the\r\nworld, and \u201cIn the Game\u201d is a stark reminder of how quickly life can force\r\nteenagers to become adults, especially when they don\u2019t have the luxury of\r\nmaking any other choice.  What\u2019s most fascinating about \u201cIn the Game,\u201d and it\u2019s\r\nremarkable how much Finitzo allows this element to unfold naturally and without\r\nunderlining, is that the young ladies that the film captures all have a\r\nstriking resilience about them. Some will be faced with tragedy. Some will be\r\nfaced with closed doors. Some will be faced with heartbreak. And yet they hold\r\ntheir heads up high and keep going in ways that I don\u2019t believe everyone\r\nwould. I think a lot of that credit can go back to Mietus and the fortitude one\r\ngains from team sports the way he teaches them. There are times in life when\r\nyour opponent will have more privilege, such as when Kelly plays Whitney Young,\r\none of the top soccer high schools in the country. They have no chance of\r\nwinning. And yet they play. They get out there. They work as a team. The idea\r\nthat we can persevere against a system that often stacks the deck against us is\r\nas important as any we can learn.  \u201cIn the Game\u201d doesn\u2019t position itself as a \u201cstatement film.\u201d\r\nThere are no statistics emblazoned on the screen. It is a study of one school athletic\r\nprogram and its players. And yet it feels more important than that. It feels\r\nempowering, even inspirational. You will lose some games. In life, you will play some\r\ngames that you never had a chance of winning. But the important thing is that\r\nyou keep playing.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Drift", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "If there are \"eight million stories in the naked city,\" then there are eight million stories in surfing, too, and \"Drift,\" a new film from Australia, is one of them. Uneven and lacking in focus, \"Drift\" tells the story of the burgeoning surf-gear business in Australia in the 1960s and '70s. Companies like Rip Curl, Billabong, and Quiksilver started as local brands and soon exploded to dominate world-wide (they still do). Who were the guys who revolutionized surf board design? How did that revolution happen? Co-directed by Ben Nott and Morgan O'Neill (who also wrote the screenplay), \"Drift\" stars Sam Worthington, Myles Pollard, and Xavier Samuel as three Australian surfers who open a backyard surf-gear business in the 1970s. They face problems getting loans, problems with drug trafficking, problems with girls, as well as intermittent attacks of existential angst. The acting is quite good, natural and fresh, and the surfing footage is magnificent. \"Drift,\" though, is a weird mix, and not always successful.  Advertisement Jimmy (Xavier Samuel) and Andy (Myles Pollard) are brothers whose mother (Robyn Malcolm) works as a seamstress to make ends meet. Her sons work in a local mill and surf on their days off. Jimmy is good enough to win local surfing competitions but it certainly isn't a career. A scruffy guy named J.B. (Sam Worthington) drives around Australia's wild Western coast, living in a camper van painted like Ken Kesey's crazy bus, with the words \"NOWHERE FAST\" unfurling across the top. He supports himself by taking photographs of surfers from time to time, and his stuff is featured in magazines. But he has scorn for \"The Man,\" and prides himself on not being owned by anyone. Traveling with J.B. is Lani, a Hawaiian woman (played by Lesley-Ann Brandt) who befriends the Kelly brothers. The business starts to take off. Many surfing movies run along the expected sports-formula narrative, with an underdog coming from behind to win the big competition, surf the fiercest wave, beat the odds. \"Drift\" succumbs to some of those formulaic elements, especially when it comes to the character of Lani, whose only purpose is to be a purveyor of pep talks to the boys, as well as a quasi-love-interest and, in one scene, a damsel in distress. There's a scary ex-con in town who seems to take offense to the Kelly brothers' endeavor, and there is a scene straight out of Roger Corman where the ex-con and his threatening buddies roar into the middle of a happy barbecue on their motorcycles being threatening for no apparent reason.  The Kelly brothers deal with the unimaginative and conservative resistance of local bankers who refuse to loan them money. Surfing is just a hobby, you see, and the Kelly boys are seen as losers who need to get a job. All of this Individual vs. The Man stuff is handled in a ham-fisted way; many of the scenes lack life and energy. It's unfortunate, because Myles Pollard is such a compelling and natural presence. He makes every scene seem real merely by his reaction shots, the openness of his face, his charm and charisma. He's wonderful.  Advertisement Andy Kelly is the visionary. He believes that there is a market for the shorter boards meant for big waves, and he believes that big-wave surfing is where the industry is headed. He doesn't think of becoming a millionaire. It's just that he knows he has a good idea, and he'd like to make money from surfing somehow. \"Drift\" has an eccentric and gritty appreciation of the entrepreneur and the nuts and bolts of starting a business. \"Drift\" is about sitting in offices, drawing up plans, finding good real estate for your storefront. While these scenes are sometimes interesting, you keep wanting them to get back out into the water. Surfing films are often about the glory. \"Drift\" is not. The glory, though, comes in the cinematography. Geoffrey Hall did the photography for the film. \"Drift\" did not have a big budget, and they shot in 32 days. None of the enormous waves barreling down on the camera were created with visual effects or tweaked digitally. All three main actors grew up surfing and were comfortable in that often-dangerous environment. There is one sequence that has to be seen to be believed. The three tool out in an inflated boat to try to tow themselves onto a notorious break of 30-to-40 foot waves. As J.B. says to Jimmy, \"The problem isn't how to ride that wave. The problem is catching it.\" The waves rear up as massive building-sized monsters, and the sense of danger and adrenaline in the three actors is palpable. There are no do-overs with such a scene. It's an incredible feat of filmmaking, and refreshing if you love good surf movies. In \"Riding Giants,\" the 2004 surfing documentary, legendary surfer Greg Noll talks about the surfing movies in the 1960s, and mocks how the actors would be sitting on surf boards in what looked like a flat pond waiting for a wave, and then suddenly be fake-riding a big wave. Noll shakes his head in disgust and says, \"It made me want to puke.\" \"Drift\" gives you the extreme pleasure of knowing that what you are seeing, the waves, the foam, the mammoth breaks, the surfing itself, is real. If only there were more of it.  Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Single Moms Club", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\"The Single Moms Club\" is almost good. The premise, if not the most original thing in the world, is at least full of promise. Five single mothers from different backgrounds are thrown together by the principal at their childrens' prep school, and told to plan a fundraiser. The school is threatening to expel their kids due to various infractions, and somehow (it's never made clear why) forcing the mothers of these bad kids to plan an event is seen as the perfect solution. Never mind. These devices are par for the course in a Tyler Perry film. So is an overwhelming desire to tie everything up in a neat bow. The movie is called \"The Single Moms Club,\" but Perry can't stick with the theme of that title, not really; he can't resist making sure that every lady has a man by the end. Nobody's going to be a \"single mom\" for long.  Advertisement One of the single moms is Hillary (Amy Smart). She's recovering from a nasty divorce from her attorney husband, who has reduced alimony, forcing her to \"let go of her help,\" primarily a Spanish-speaking maid who spends more time with her three kids than she does. Another single mom is Jan (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a book editor struggling to prove to her otherwise all-male workspace that she can do a good job as partner even though she's, well, a single mom. May (Nia Long, in a terrific performance) is a journalist and aspiring author, trying to guide her troubled son Rick through the rough waters of having an absentee drug addict for a dad. Zulay Henao plays Esperanza, a woman still under the thumb of her bossy ex-husband, who threatens to kick her out of the house he bought for her if she dares to bring another man home. And finally there is Lytia (Cocoa Brown), a woman with five kids (the two eldest in jail), a waitressing job, no car, and a determination to keep her 12-year-old son on the straight and narrow. The first meeting of the Single Moms Club does not go well, and there is the usual culture and class clash. Lytia has zero sympathy for the rich helpless white women who don't know what they will do without a maid. Jan finds Lytia hard and \"like a big black wall\" (an unfortunate phrase, which she then elaborates on, in an incredibly awkward extended monologue). Eventually, of course, they all start to see one another as equals and friends. Walls break down. The women set up a rotating babysitting system so that they can have at least one night off a week, and they also get to work planning the charity event. Writer/producer/director/actor Tyler Perry juggles all of this pretty well, and the actors are sympathetic and engaging. The real challenges of people trying to parent alone are highlighted. He even shows sympathy for Hillary, who didn't know her own daughter got her period because her daughter told the maid instead of her. You feel for all of them. There is a good balance in the dynamic, and it makes sense that these different women might become \r\nfriends. Despite their differences, they have a lot in common. Advertisement But then the men start showing up, one by one, in a muddled parade. First there is T.K. (Tyler Perry), who meets-cute with May in a parking lot, then shows up at her house with the purse she left behind. He tells her he looked through her purse and found her book manuscript in there and read it and thought it was really good, and can he take her out to dinner? Because this is La-La Land and not reality, May does not seem alarmed or freaked out by his behavior.\u00a0 Hillary, meanwhile, awkwardly lusts over her handyman neighbor (Ryan Eggold), but is too shy to make a move. Esperanza is in love with a bartender named Manny (William Levy) but is terrified that her ex-husband will find out. Jan has been celibate for 10 years, but May introduces her to one of her co-workers and Voila, Jan is back on the road to love. Meanwhile, Lytia is being courted (against her will, really) by a swaggering personal trainer named Branson who keeps showing up at her place of work and won't take No for an answer. The romances are handled slapdash. When T.K. and May first kiss it is so awkward it looks like a mistake. With the exception of Esperanza and Manny, nobody has any real chemistry and the \"finding love\" storylines just do not mesh with the overall message of the film. The script feels lazy in that way. But sometimes (rarely but sometimes), there's a moment, a mood, that is touching, poignant, even powerful. The best scene in the film involves May and her son Rick. Rick's dad (never seen in the \r\nfilm) had promised his son he'd pick him up from school, and Dad is once again a no-show. Instead of having a heart-to-heart with her son, she lets him be and waits nearby in the car as her son, small and defeated, sits on the school steps. Jan, on her way to pick up her own daughter, asks May what's going on, and May, staring over at Rick, keeping her distance, says, \"I try to see which way Rick\u2019s going to fall, and I try to catch him.\" Nia Long is a beautiful actress, with a fresh and natural presence. She is emotionally accessible and funny. Neither the bossy machinations of the script nor its requirement that she pair up with T.K. at the end can dim her light.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Revenant", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Great film has the power to convey the unimaginable. We sit\r\nin the comfort of a darkened theater or our living room and watch protagonists\r\nsuffer through physical and emotional pain that most of us can\u2019t really\r\ncomprehend. Too often, these endurance tests feel manipulative or, even worse,\r\nfalse. We\u2019re smart enough to \u201csee the strings\u201d being pulled, and the actor and\r\nset never fades away into the character and condition. What\u2019s remarkable about\r\nAlejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s \u201cThe Revenant\u201d is how effectively it transports\r\nus to another time and place, while always maintaining its worth as a piece of\r\nvisual art. You don\u2019t just watch \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d you experience it. You\r\nwalk out of it exhausted, impressed with the overall quality of the filmmaking\r\nand a little more grateful for the creature comforts of your life. Advertisement I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and co-writer Mark L. Smith set their tone early,\r\nstaging a breathtaking assault on a group of fur trappers by Native Americans,\r\nportrayed not just as \u201cenemies\u201d but a violent force of nature. While a few\r\ndozen men are preparing to pack up and move on to their next stop in the great\r\nAmerican wilderness, a scene out of \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d unfolds. Arrows pierce air\r\nand flesh as the few surviving men flee to a nearby boat. It turns out that the\r\ntribe is seeking a kidnapped daughter of its leader, and will kill anyone who\r\ngets in their way. At the same time, we learn that one of the trappers, Hugh\r\nGlass (Leonardo DiCaprio) has a half-Native American son named Hawk (Forrest\r\nGoodluck).  Low on men and hunted, the expedition\r\nleader Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) orders that their crew return to its\r\nbase, a fort in the middle of this snowy wilderness. John Fitzgerald (Tom\r\nHardy) disagrees, and the seeds of dissent are planted. He doesn\u2019t trust Henry,\r\nand he doesn\u2019t like Glass. In the midst of these discussions, Glass is away\r\nfrom the crew one day when he\u2019s brutally attacked by a bear\u2014the sequence is,\r\nwithout hyperbole, one of the most stunning things I\u2019ve seen on film in a long\r\ntime, heart-racing and terrifying. Glass barely survives the attack.\r\nIt seems highly unlikely that he\u2019ll make it back to the base. With increasingly\r\ndangerous conditions and a tribe of killers on their heels, they agree to split\r\nup. Most of the men will go back first while Fitzgerald, Hawk and a young man\r\nnamed Bridger (Will Poulter) will get a sizable fee to stay with Glass until he\r\ndies, giving him as much comfort as possible in his final days and the\r\nburial he deserves. Of course, Fitzgerald quickly tires of having to watch a man\r\nhe doesn\u2019t care about die. He kills Hawk in front of an immobile Glass and then\r\nbasically buries Hugh alive. As Bridger and Fitzgerald head back, Glass\r\nessentially rises from the dead (the word revenant means \u201cone that returns\r\nafter death or a long absence\u201d) and begins his quest for vengeance. With broken\r\nbones, no food, and miles to go, he pulls himself through snow and across\r\nmountains, seeking the man who killed his son. He is practically a ghost, a man\r\nwho has come as close to death as one possibly can but is unwilling to go to\r\nthe other side until justice is done. Advertisement The bulk of \u201cThe Revenant\u201d consists of this torturous\r\njourney, as Glass regains his strength and gets closer to home through sheer\r\nforce of will. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s Oscar-winning cinematographer for \u201cBirdman,\u201d Emmanuel Lubezki (who\r\nalso took a trophy for \u201cGravity\u201d the year before and could easily make it three\r\nin a row for this work) shoots \u201cThe Revenant\u201d in a way that conveys both the\r\nharrowing conditions and the artistry of his vision. The sky seems to go on\r\nforever; the horizon is neverending. He works in a color palette provided by\r\nnature, and yet enhanced. The snow seems whiter, the sky bluer. Many of his\r\nshots, especially in times of great danger like the opening attack and the bear\r\nscene, are unbroken\u2014placing us in the middle of the action. At other times, Lubezki\u2019s choices recall his work on \u201cThe\r\nTree of Life,\u201d especially in scenes in the second half when Glass\u2019s journey\r\ngets more mystical. And that\u2019s where the film falters a bit.\u00a0I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u00a0doesn\u2019t\r\nquite have a handle on those second-half scenes and the 156-minute running time\r\nbegins to feel self-indulgent as the film loses focus. When it centers on\r\nthe conditions and the tale of a man unwilling to die, it\u2019s mesmerizing. I just\r\nthink there\u2019s a tighter version, especially in the mid-section, that would be\r\neven more effective. About that man: So much has been made of this film being DiCaprio\u2019s\r\n\u201cOverdue Oscar\u201d shot that I feel like his actual work here will be undervalued.\r\nMake no mistake. Should he win, it will not be some \u201cLifetime Achievement\u201d win\r\nas we\u2019ve seen in the past for actors who we all thought should have won for\r\nanother film (Paul Newman, Al Pacino, etc.). He\u2019s completely committed in every terrifying moment, pushing himself further than he ever has\r\nbefore as an actor.

Tom Hardy is less effective,\r\noften going a little too heavy on the tics (wide eyes, shot up-close), but I\r\nthink that\u2019s a fault of the direction and not one of our best actors. In the\r\nend, this is DiCaprio\u2019s film through and through, and he nails every\r\nchallenging beat, literally throwing himself into this character that\r\ndemands more of him physically than any other before.\u00a0 What would you do for vengeance?

So, yes, improbably enough in the year\r\nof our Lord 2015, Australian filmmaking (once upon a time replete with original\r\nand powerful voices, more\u2019s the pity) is offering up a slab of gigglingy\r\nsadistic sub-early-Tarantino hogwash.

{"Title": "Coherence", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\"Coherence\" is proof that inventive filmmakers can do a lot with a little. Written and directed by\u00a0James Ward Byrkit, the movie starts out looking and feeling like half the no-budget indies you've seen: a bunch of seemingly well-off people attend a dinner party at a nice suburban house somewhere in Northern California on the night that a comet is scheduled to pass near the earth. They introduce themselves to each other, hang out, drink, eat and deliver expository banter. Then things get weird, and weirder.\u00a0 Advertisement \"Coherence\" was produced on a shoestring. You can tell. It's shot with multiple video cameras, often wildly, and while much of the overlapping dialogue is comprehensible, some sinks into audio muck. A lot of the action in this night-set film is confined to the interior of the house. When the characters venture outdoors, it's hard to tell what's going on because you can barely see the actors. That the comet has allegedly wrought havoc with electricity only partly excuses this. Even on a moonless night in a forest, your eyes adjust.\u00a0 Amazingly, though, none of the movie's technical or artistic shortcomings prove to be deal breakers. Once \"Coherence\" delves into its premise, the viewer is bound to come down with a bad case of the creeps. This is a less-is-more science fiction-horror tale, indebted to the original \"The Twilight Zone\" (particularly \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\") as well Luis Bunuel's \"The Exterminating Angel,\" as well as certain recent science fiction indies that I won't name here because I did, you'd immediately deduce the film's first big twist. (Spoilers start in the next paragraph.) And it's genuinely more of a horror film than a suspense or \"terror\" film because, while there's some violence, the source of unease is philosophical. The characters are frightened by what they don't know, then by the implications of what they've been able to figure out. What's being threatened in \"Coherence\" is who they are, or what they think they are; not just the integrity of their bodies (though that's at risk, too) but their identities. This is an ensemble movie, but its closest thing to a protagonist is Em (Emily Foxler, who has a great reactive face), a dancer whose career has suffered an unspecified setback. Em shows up at the party with her boyfriend Kevin (Maury Sterling of \u201cHomeland\u201d) who proceeds to add tension to the evening by offering up an anecdote involving his ex-girlfriend Laurie (Lauren Maher), who's also a guest. Also on hand is Mike (Nicholas Brendon of \"Buffy\") whose greatest performance might be as a guy who isn't depressed and irritated that nobody remembers that he starred on \"Roswell.\" \u00a0There's a pagan cleric type named\u00a0Beth (Elizabeth Gracen), and a tall, volatile, bearded guy named Hugh (Hugo Armstrong) who keeps trying to contact a friend who seems to have inside knowledge of all the strange goings-on (disrupted cell phone service, power outages and the like).\u00a0 Advertisement The first vertigo-inducing moment comes when Hugh returns from an expedition to the only fully lighted house in the neighborhood and reports that he peeked through the windows and saw them\u2014the members of that very group\u2014having dinner. In the other house. In the other house!!\u00a0There are mysterious notes left on the front door; numbered photographs of the principal characters (one seemingly taken that very day); accusations that a certain character is not really that character; wary or secretive expressions on the faces of people you thought you could trust. What on earth, or in the heavens, is going on? I'll stop here because I don't want to oversell the movie. It's not a masterpiece, not by a long shot, but it does demonstrate a refreshing willingness to embrace the unknown, the implied, the mysterious. And although it takes a left turn near the end that some viewers might not like, you should at least give it credit for refusing to get complacent. This is a confident movie that feels like the first entry in career worth following.", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "A Letter to Momo", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "As is so often the case in Japanese animation, displacement\r\nand emotional upheaval lead to interaction with the supernatural in the\r\ndelicate and effective \u201cA Letter to Momo,\u201d finally opening stateside today and\r\nexpanding over the next month after years building buzz on the festival circuit\r\n(it played TIFF in 2011) and even longer in its detailed, hand-drawn\r\nproduction. Writer/director Hiroyuki Okiura last made waves over a decade ago\r\nwith \u201cJin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade\u201d but this complex, delicate project took seven\r\nyears to make and a surprisingly long time to work its way through the\r\ninternational film market to U.S. theaters. With the recent announcement that\r\nStudio Ghibli may no longer be creating its own films after the retirement of Hayao Miyazaki and will move on to merely manage its impressive\r\nand influential library, fans of this kind of animated storytelling have high\r\nhopes for \u201cMomo.\u201d Those expectations are mostly fulfilled thanks to a deep\r\nemotional understanding of grief on Okiura\u2019s part and the captivating visuals\r\nthat accompany the story of a girl who needs some otherworldly help when she\u2019s\r\nforced to grow up far too quickly. Advertisement Momo Miyaura is the Alice of this adventure into Wonderland,\r\nan 11-year-old girl forced to relocate with her mother after the passing of her\r\nfather. Momo and her asthmatic mother move back to mom\u2019s childhood home, an\r\nisolated island named Shio, far from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo in which\r\nMomo was raised. Momo doesn\u2019t fit in. She\u2019s too frightened to jump in the water\r\nwith the other local kids. She clutches the letter from her father that he was\r\nplanning to write just before he died that says merely, \u201cDear Momo\u2026\u201d What did\r\nhe want to say to her in his final moments? Will Momo ever know? Or will she be\r\nable to stop obsessing over past thoughts unexpressed? Into this emotional upheaval drops three imps from the \u201cAbove\u201d\u2014Kawa,\r\nMame and Iwa. Momo is not supposed to be able to see this memorably designed\r\ncreatures but she can and they become something of a support structure for a\r\ngirl dealing with the unimaginable grief of losing a parent. She essentially\r\ntraps them in this world, holding the totem that keeps them here instead of\r\nreturning to the other side. Giving an 11-year-old control over passage between\r\nthis world and the next after something as uncontrollable as a father\u2019s death\r\nmakes for a beautifully connected film on a spiritual level. Overall, Okiura\r\nstays very focused on Momo\u2019s emotional journey, which is smart. It\u2019s not as\r\nfantastical as \u201cSpirited Away\u201d or many other films about children who encounter\r\nthe supernatural upon being forced to deal with death, as Momo always stays front and center. The final moments of her journey out of despair are powerfully emotional. In fact, \u201cA Letter to Momo\u201d is more playful than magical.\r\nThe differentiation in exaggerated design between the three imps that befriend Momo is remarkably\r\neffective and their actions are, as is common with magical creatures in\r\nJapanese animation, downright childish at times. Kawa fends off a wild boar\r\nwith a magical fart in slow-motion; the kind of moment that would probably earn\r\na film like this critical scorn for gross-out humor were it in a DreamWorks\r\nfilm but works in the fabric of this piece overall. They dance, lick Momo\u2019s leg\r\nfor attention, eat like slobs\u2014they\u2019re designed in such a way that they seem\r\nmore childish than Momo, which is essential to her journey to adulthood through\r\ngrief.  There are times where one feels the two-hour length of \u201cA\r\nLetter to Momo,\u201d especially in the over-long first act\u2014it takes almost half an\r\nhour for Momo to interact with the imps that will become the backbone of the story.\r\nEven scenes that work, such as a climax on a rain-soaked bridge, feel like they\r\ncould have been trimmed by a few hand-drawn frames. Maybe then it wouldn\u2019t have\r\ntaken so long for a film this sweet, delicate, and fun to get to U.S.\r\naudiences. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Girlhood", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "C\u00e9line Sciamma's films are delicate and emotional examinations of, to quote Madonna, \"what it feels like for a girl.\" Sciamma has directed three features thus far: \"Water Lilies,\" \"Tomboy,\" and now \"Girlhood\" and each one takes on a different sliver of the spectrum of adolescent or pre-adolescent girlhood. Girls are not a monolith, they are not all the same, they are not \"the other,\" although you'd never know it considering some of the films out there. It takes an intuitive and devoted filmmaker like Sciamma to go beneath the surface of \"girlhood\", to remove the normal trappings, and to look at all of the different forces and influences in play. \"Girlhood,\" her latest, is a powerful and entertaining film about a gang of girls, and what friendship means, the protection it provides. Advertisement \n \"Girlhood\" follows Marieme (the extraordinary Karidja Tour\u00e9) through her 16th year. She lives in a big housing project, and is the main caretaker of her younger sister. Her grades are poor and she is being pushed to transfer to a technical school and learn a trade. Her mother (Binta Diop) works so many jobs she is never around, and Marieme has to answer to her brother (Cyril Mendy), who is downright abusive. Marieme is a sweet and shy girl, her hair falling down her back in braids. One day three tough Rizzo-types, lolling on the bleachers, summon her over to their pow-wow. Their motivations aren't clear at first. Marieme seems much younger than these glamour girls, all of whom wear long straight weaves, identical gold necklaces, and red lipstick. The cliche is that the \"bad girls\" will \"corrupt\" the good girl. But Sciamma is up to something different, thank goodness. \n These three girls are Lady (the wonderful Assa Sylla), the leader of the pack, and the two humorous underlings, Fily (Mari\u00e9tou Tour\u00e9) and Adiatou (Lindsay Karamoh). They need a \"fourth\" to round out their group. They're trouble-makers, engaged in fighting with another group of girls; nothing too serious, just a lot of screaming insults across train platforms. Marieme enters the group dynamic: the four girls hustle, they shop-lift, they book hotel rooms and eat pizza. The gang of girls do not initiate Marieme into a dangerous world of drugs and sex. No, the tough girls initiate her into a world of belonging, of fun trash-talk, an environment where she can let loose, try on makeup and a different hairstyle (for her friends' benefit, not for any romantic prospect's benefit), and experiment a little bit with identity. The new persona might not \"fit\" Marieme, ultimately, but she's 16 years old. She's figuring it out. \n Life is tough out there, and the girls are aware of it. There are pimp-type guys starting to show interest in them, circling like sharks. There are judgmental fathers and brothers, who shame the girls for growing up, for wanting to stretch their wings a little bit, sexually. Marieme starts to date, tentatively, a boy she's known forever, named Isma\u00ebl (Idrissa Diabat\u00e9). Their scenes together offer a sweet space where both can allow themselves to be tender, in contrast to the closed-up toughness required in their larger world. They click. But it feels precarious. The girls watch their friends get knocked up and, for all intents and purposes, vanish from the world. They don't want that for themselves. They want \u2026 something else, something more. Freedom. Liberty. To be left alone. Advertisement \n What Sciamma is interested in is \"moments.\" There are many moments that linger in the mind long after the film has ended. The epic slo-mo all-female football game of the opening. An early scene showing a raucous group of girls heading back to the projects, all talking at once, until they fall into silence, collectively, when they approach a group of boys lounging on the steps. The repeat shots of the back of Marieme's head throughout, breaking \"Girlhood\" up into unofficial \"chapters.\" Marieme washing dishes, emerging into the concrete yard outside, the camera following her, her head facing out. (Sciamma started \"Tomboy\" with the back of a head as well, a head with shorn-short hair, looking away, creating an automatic confusion as to whether it was a boy or a girl, the whole theme of the film.) In \"Girlhood,\" there are fight scenes and a hilarious miniature-golf excursion, as well as many painful reminders that no, they will not be left alone, the world cannot leave the girls alone. \n A masterpiece scene comes halfway through, so powerful in its representation of shared joy and freedom that it sets off echoes around it that continue throughout the rest of the film. The girls have shop-lifted pretty dresses, and booked a hotel room where they can hang out for the night, maybe go out to a club later in their stolen goods. There's a sense of exhilaration in the moment, and the four get up and start dancing together to Rihanna\u2019s \u201cDiamonds.\u201d The light is a deep blue, and the girls are jumping and laughing and loving each other's awesomeness for almost the entirety of the song. All four are in the frame at the same time. Sciamma has given us what feels like a real event, a real moment, one of those precious moments in time that the girls might look back on and think, \"That. That was good.\" \n The final section of \"Girlhood\" doesn't quite have the energy of the rest of it, although Karidja Tour\u00e9 is such a compelling presence, and Marieme is such a watchable character, that her experiences create a tension all their own. What will become of Marieme? The group friendship is formative, powerful, for all of them, it is something they treasure and cling to, but they're also just teenage girls. They're not sure yet what is going to be the most important thing in their lives. \n Comparisons will be made, inevitably, to Richard Linklater's \"Boyhood,\" merely because of the title. They are two very different films. Sciamma's films could all go under the title \"Girlhood.\" Her films do not diagnose. They don't worry (at least not overtly). They do not assume that \"girlhood\" is mostly an experience of inevitable derailment. Adolescence is a time of growth and change, of trying on new identities, seeing which one fits the best. Girls \"come of age\" just like boys do,\u00a0 but many films take the attitude that it's more dangerous for girls to experiment. That might be partially true, because of pregnancy, but it is not entirely true. \"We Are the Best!\" was a terrific antidote to that prevalent teenage-girls-in-peril narrative, and so is \"Girlhood.\" It's not that Sciamma sugar-coats the dangers that are out there. It is that she is more interested in how girls figure things out than in the many ways girls can go wrong. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "The Post", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "\u201cWe have to be the check on their power. We don\u2019t hold them accountable, my God, who will?\u201d Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cThe Post,\u201d rushed into production on a turnaround time that only Ridley Scott could possibly match, may be the story of a challenge to the free press in 1971 but lines like that solidify how much it\u2019s intended to also be read as a mirror of 2017. As the President of the United States challenges different journalistic institutions, mostly through his Twitter feed, and \u201ctruth\u201d seems to have become a looser term than ever before, \u201cThe Post\u201d is designed to be viewed as a commentary on today as much as yesterday, maybe even more. It\u2019s fascinating to consider a film this well-constructed and packed with talented performers that would have played completely differently just two years ago. However, I wonder if hurrying the movie\u00a0to strike a moment\u00a0was the right decision.\u00a0It's a film that\u00a0often calls attention to its own self-importance and falters when compared to Spielberg\u2019s best historical dramas like \u201cMunich\u201d and \u201cLincoln,\u201d movies that earn their messages instead of just stating them.\u00a0One can almost see the weight on its shoulders to \u201csay something important,\u201d and it sometimes drags down the entire venture. However, there\u2019s more than enough to like here, including a great ensemble, the best performance from a living legend in years, and, again, a message that feels depressingly timely. Advertisement \u201cThe Post\u201d tells the story of the Pentagon Papers, choosing to focus\u00a0on two key players in the unfolding battle between the free press and a White House that struggled to keep the secrets of how our government handled the Vietnam War under wraps. As Fritz Beebe (Tracy Letts, continuing his amazing 2017) says at one point, this was the first time that the court system of our government basically tried to stop the function of the free press.    It started when Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) walked away with thousands of pages on the history of Vietnam, including sensitive and confidential information that revealed the lies the government had told the American people for years. To sum it up superficially with a line from the movie, \u201cMcNamara knew we couldn\u2019t win in \u201965.\u201d Six years later, with thousands of deaths on their hands, the truth was revealed, first in the\u00a0New York Times. The courts ruled that the Times couldn\u2019t publish any more of the documents or what they learned from them, but the\u00a0Washington Post found their way into the story as well with Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk) getting to the same source as his competition. Suddenly, the Post was sitting on hundreds of pages of sensitive documents that the courts had ruled couldn\u2019t be published. If they ran a story, not only could they go out of business, they could literally be arrested for treason. What would you do?    The two central figures of this story are Kay Graham (Meryl Streep), the beleaguered publisher of the Post, doing a good job that too many men around her consider her incapable of doing, and Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), the editor of the Post, and the man who never questions whether of not they should publish. In casting alone, Spielberg makes clear his opinion of Graham and Bradlee, filling their shoes with two of the most beloved actors of all time. And they both deliver for their director, particularly Streep, who hasn\u2019t given a performance this nuanced in a very long time\u2014reminding one what she can do when she\u2019s paired with the right collaborator (my biggest problem with Streep\u2019s \u201800s and \u201810s work is how rarely she works with directors who challenge her). Hanks finds the right degree of gravity for Bradlee as well, although both occasionally slip up due to a script that too often calls attention to itself. This story should be about Graham\u2019s fear that she may make the wrong decision\u2014for her business or for the state of journalism as a whole\u2014but the stakes don\u2019t always feel right. We never really question what anyone is going to do in \u201cThe Post,\" especially given how well-reported this story has been. (Although even if you know none of this story, there's a distinct lack of suspense.) And to make up for that lack of actual tension, co-writers Liz Hannah and Josh Singer sprinkle in heavy doses of the kind of things people only say in movies (\u201cJefferson just rolled over in his grave,\u201d for example). I often wanted a more tactile, dirtier version of \u201cThe Post,\u201d one that didn\u2019t feel like it was taking place in a Hollywood vacuum. Bob Odenkirk almost steals the movie just by seeming the least like a mouthpiece.    However, the truth is that every time \u201cThe Post\u201d threatens to slide into pure, pretentious melodrama, the talent of someone involved pulls it out. Whether it\u2019s a subtle choice made by Streep or Hanks, an economy of storytelling displayed by Spielberg, a composition by John Williams\u2014there\u2019s always something to hold on to in \u201cThe Post\u201d that keeps it working. Even the sound design\u2014a symphony of typewriter clicking and ringing phones singing out through the Post offices\u2014is engaging. It\u2019s a movie from one of our most essential filmmakers when it comes to pure entertainment, and it works on that level. Even just the parade of familiar faces (I didn\u2019t even mention the always-welcome presences of Carrie Coon, David Cross, Sarah Paulson, or Pat Healy) will keep you engaged.    Advertisement Will that engagement continue after the journalistic tumult of the Trump administration? If we\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s that challenges to the free press will always persist, and so there are almost certainly lessons for future generations in \u201cThe Post.\u201d Will it hold up as cinema outside of its cultural moment? On the one hand, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Despite what people want to argue in comments sections, film doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, it often responds to and plays differently because of current events. And so while I\u2019m curious to see how people remember \u201cThe Post\u201d in ten years, we can only respond to it today, as institutions like the newspaper at its center are yet again under attack. Where are the Kay Grahams and Ben Bradlees of today? While I wish \u201cThe Post\u201d asked this question more directly and angrily, there\u2019s definite value in people this prominent\u00a0asking it at all.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Captain Fantastic", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\"Captain Fantastic,\" written and directed by \"Silicon Valley\"'s Matt Ross, presents a family who have retreated from the world into the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest. They are off the grid. They hunt for food. They are self-reliant. It's \"Swiss Family Robinson,\" or that 1970s series of films about \"The Wilderness Family.\" Fresh air. No consumerism. No materialism. Okay, sounds fine, if a little unsustainable. Such utopias need a strong leader, and father Ben (Viggo Mortensen) is that. He treats his five kids as though they are military recruits (as well as PhD candidates). Because they are children, and because they are cut off from other influences, they parrot back to him his words, they share his worldview without question. It's Family as Cult. All of this is extremely intriguing, calling to mind films like \"The Mosquito Coast,\" or \"Running on Empty,\" which had similar cloistered family atmospheres, and charismatic controlling (albeit well-meaning) fathers. But \"Captain Fantastic\" treats the situation (and Ben) so uncritically and so sympathetically that there is a total disconnect between what is actually onscreen and what Ross thinks is onscreen. Advertisement When the film opens, the mother of this little clan (Trin Miller's Leslie) has been hospitalized for bipolar disorder, leaving Dad as \"captain\" of the ship. He puts the kids through fight training, boot camp drills and ushers his oldest son Bodevan (George MacKay) into manhood through the ritual of stalking and killing a deer solo. At night they sit around a campfire, the kids reading books like Guns, Germs and Steel, Middlemarch\u00a0and Dostoevsky. They argue about capitalism and exploited classes, sounding like little robots, Bodevan informing his dad at one point, \"I'm not a Trotsky-ist anymore. I'm a Maoist.\" (This is a family where \"Trotsky-ist\" is descriptive and \"Trotsky-ite\" is an insult. It's like it's 1929 in the Soviet Union.) The kids miss their mother and want to know when she's coming back. When Ben gets word that Leslie has killed herself, he informs the kids in blunt plain language. Leslie's parents blame Ben for everything and forbid him from coming to the funeral. Ben, who has set up his whole life so that he never has to answer to anyone, piles the kids into their gigantic school bus, and heads off to crash the funeral and make sure Leslie gets the Buddhist cremation ceremony she always wanted. It's a long road trip. They pull off occasionally, once to steal supplies from a grocery store (they've run such drills before), and once for an annual family ritual: the celebration of Noam Chomsky Day. What will happen one day if one of the kids decides Noam Chomsky is full of it? Will that even be allowed? The irony here, and it is a terrible one, is that Ben is raising his kids to question the status quo, to not swallow any information wholesale, and yet he creates an environment where questioning his authority\u00a0is impossible. The family stops and stays the night with family (Kathryn Hahn's Harper, Steve Zahn's\u00a0Dave\u00a0and their two kids), and the culture clash is extreme. Ben's kids don't know anything about pop culture. To win the argument that his kids have been educated just fine without going to school, Ben forces his six-year-old to give an impromptu treatise on the Bill of Rights, the purpose of which is to shame the public-school cousins who have no idea about anything. The child rattling off facts about the Bill of Rights is supposed to be adorable and comedic as well as a \"high five\" moment for the family. I guess. It looked more like Ben was being a sanctimonious bully towards those who welcomed him into their home. Advertisement \"Captain Fantastic\" does acknowledge some of the issues in a character like Ben: Bodevan has to apply to college behind his dad's back, and Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton) rebels openly against his father's control. Rellian makes a choice at one point that feels like a victory and then he backtracks, apologizing to his father for disobedience. To his apology, Ben does not say, \"I'm sorry too.\" He says, \"I love you.\" It's supposed to be touching. It's not. Rellian is ten years old. He has nothing to apologize for. That's the issue with \"Captain Fantastic\" in a nutshell. \"Captain Fantastic\" is so soft on Ben that when Frank Langella shows up as Leslie's father, and expresses outrage at the way Ben raises the children, he sounds like the voice of reason. And yet the film treats Langella as though he's the villain, a self-satisfied Fat Cat, emblematic of everything Ben and his wife (and their drone-children) hate. (\"Look at the unethical use of space!\" chirps one of Ben's daughters, looking at their grandfather's backyard.) The kids (Hamilton, MacKay, Charlie Shotwell, Shree Crooks, Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso) are all excellent, and create a believable family unit. Mortensen gives Ben's authoritarian bent shadings of softness, openness, especially when he encourages his kids to think their thoughts through (forcing his daughter to go deeper in her literary analysis of Lolita is a nice little scene). Mortensen is a tremendously powerful actor, and he can do more in a closeup than most actors can with their whole bodies. It's the attitude of the film that's the problem. Jean-Jacques Rousseau didn't invent the idea of getting back to nature as the ultimate Good. It's been with human beings since Adam and Eve frolicked in the garden. The thinking goes: If human beings could \"get back to nature,\" then maybe all the problems in the world could be eradicated. But there's an error in that kind of thinking. Citizens of poverty-struck countries already live in a \"natural\" state, with no running water, subsistence agriculture, no modern medicine. They could probably tell the hippies a thing or two about how \"nature\" in its raw state is no great shakes, and a warm bed and a hot bath are nothing to sneeze at. But the mindset persists and it crosses ideological lines. There are the Amish and the Mennonites. There are the \"survivalists,\" holed up in compounds with their arsenals and conspiracy theories. There are the radical off-shoots of Christianity favoring homeschooling, and prioritizing being \"in but not of\" the world. Jonestown is the most dangerous example of what a retreat from the world can result in, but there are others with equally devastating consequences. Society isn't the problem. Man is the problem. A utopia can only work if it's made up of one person. The second another person shows up, you're going to have problems. If Ben were a \"Jesus Camp\" type, steeped in a political brand of Christianity, preparing his kids for apocalyptic Rapture, would his behavior be presented as adorably eccentric as it is here? Would a film present a survivalist-dad holed up with his kids and his weaponry as uncritically? It's the same mindset, just different ideologies. Just because Ben is a lefty doesn't mean he's not a jerk. \"Captain Fantastic\" could have used a lot more skepticism. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Swiss Army Man", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "One thing you definitely can't say about \"Swiss Army Man\" is \"Oh, not that again.\"\u00a0 This film from the writer-director team of Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (who are billed as The Daniels)\u00a0starts on a deserted island, with a depressed man named Hank (Paul Dano) interrupting a suicide attempt to check out what he thinks is a shipwreck survivor (Daniel Radcliffe) who's washed ashore nearby. The man is dead, and very flatulent. Hank doesn't manage to bring him back to life, but his resuscitation attempts make the corpse spew fresh water from its mouth like an old fashioned hand-pumped faucet and increases his expenditure of gas.\u00a0 Advertisement Hank rides the corpse through the waves like a jet ski until they both make landfall, then carries him on his back through the forest like Luke Skywalker carrying Yoda, talking to him about life, love, and what it means to be human. The corpse, whom Hank meaningfully dubs \"Manny,\" has the power of speech, but has forgotten everything, so Hank tells him everything he knows. Manny's relationship to Hank is that of a trusting young child and his father, though not exclusively. At various points in \"Swiss Army Man,\" the central duo could be likened to buddies in a buddy picture, boyfriend-girlfriend, Pinocchio and Gepetto, and partners in an extended outdoor theatrical improv exercise. One of the longest sequences is set in a cave whose border forms a proscenium arch across the screen; in time the men build an elaborate \"set\" there, out of garbage, and re-enact a key moment in a man's life. The title describes the way that Hank discovers and utilizes Manny's \r\ndifferent abilities: in addition to being a gas factory, a jet ski and a\r\n water pump, he's a \"gun\" who can spit objects at high speed, an \"axe\" \r\nwho can chop things with his arm, and more. You're always aware of the various component parts that fed the filmmakers' imaginations (mainly other movies, music videos, and perhaps children's books and fairy tales), but \"Swiss Army Man\" is such a Frankenstein-like amalgam of bits and pieces\u2014interesting that of all the literary comparisons I could have made, I jumped to a novel about a man trying to reanimate dead tissue; this film sure does a number on your subconscious!\u2014that you can't fairly describe it as being entirely \"like\" any one thing. The\u00a0trailer-for-itself editing style of some sections, coupled with the religiously inflected and chant-driven score (by Manchester Orchestra's Andy Hull and Robert McDowell) and shots of sunlight streaming down through forest canopies, make it feel like \"Terrence Malick's Weekend at Bernie's.\" There are moments that evoke Spike Jonze's film version of \"Where the Wild Things Are\" and \"Peter Pan\" and the collected works of David Lynch and the Pleasure Island scenes of \"Pinocchio\" and so on.  The film is elastic, transmogrifying from a psychological drama into a \r\nliterally excremental comedy and then a hard-edged survival picture, occasionally \r\nembracing the cosmic and turning into an emo hipster answer to \"2001: A \r\nSpace Odyssey.\" And yet the emotional temperatures of the movie fluctuate so intuitively from moment to moment, and the situations and editing choices along with them, that there's ultimately no point trying to deal with \"Swiss Army Man\" on any terms but its own.\u00a0 It's common for critics to describe a film as \"dreamlike,\" but what does that word mean? Most of the time it means that a movie is filled with strange and not necessarily realistic imagery and situations, or that the storytelling prizes incidents and moments of raw feeling. \"Swiss Army Man\" fits all of those descriptions, but it's dreamlike in a deeper sense: like a dream, its structural logic is entirely emotional. Notice, for instance, how the rhythm of the cutting is attuned to Manny and Hank, speeding up when they are talking quickly and slowing down when we're observing them in repose. Notice, too,\u00a0how the movie uses music: sometimes Hank or Manny or both will start singing along with the score, while other times the score will seem to be taking cues from them, even listening to them and following their lead. (John Williams' score for \"Jurassic Park\"\u2014not coincidentally a Frankenstein story\u2014gets quoted more than once.) \u00a0 Advertisement The performances are just as supple. Dano's earnestness, which has been used for unsettling effect in some films, is showcased straightforwardly here, so that Hank seems a damaged but good man working through a personal catastrophe. (The whole film could be his dream.) Radcliffe's work takes Manny far beyond one-joke status. Though the performance is mainly kindhearted and guileless, suggesting a child in an adult's body, there are times when Radcliffe's delivery is so anguished, like a victim of a severe neurological trauma teaching himself to speak or walk again, that it's painful to watch. Even the most outrageous, self-consciously broad touches, such as the numerous fart jokes, have the crystalline feeling of situations encountered in a dream. Certain moments in dreams seem very silly or very stupid when you describe them to others afterward, but when you're experiencing them, they're intense, maybe not funny at all, or so purely emotional that they rip through any ironic detachment you carried into your slumber and affect you in a piercingly direct way, as a young child might react to twists in a bedtime story that a parent made up on the spot.\u00a0 The movie is not as endearing as it sometimes wants to be, it strains too hard to wow us at times, the introduction of a \"seize the day\" message reduces it, and in the end there may not be not enough plot, or situations\u2014or whatever you want to call the film's amalgamation of incidents\u2014to justify a feature length running time. (Like some dreams, it has several endings when one would have been plenty.) But \"Swiss Army Man\" is still mightily impressive for its\u00a0commitment\u00a0to its vision and its refusal to explain itself.\u00a0The Daniels have made a film that's at once a labor of love and a work of sheer arrogant nerve, one that is as likely to be described as a classic, an ambitious misfire, and one of the worst films ever made by any three people who see it together. How many movies can\u00a0you\u00a0say that about? Advertisement", "Critic": "Delta"}
{"Title": "Unbroken", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "Films like \u201cUnbroken,\u201d and the Laura Hillenbrand book on\r\nwhich it\u2019s based, capture something we all hope is true about ourselves\u2014that we too are unbreakable. That when faced with horrendous, life-threatening\r\nsituations, we would respond in similar fashion to Louis Zamperini, finding a\r\nnew well of courage within ourselves and surviving the unimaginable. It is the\r\nresilience of the human spirit that has drawn us to films based on true stories\r\nagain and again to experience pain and triumph in the relative comfort of a\r\nmovie theater seat.  Advertisement \u201cUnbroken\u201d opens with a powerfully staged and shot sequence of\r\naerial combat that surprisingly defines the film's strengths and weaknesses over\r\nthe next two-plus hours. The attention to detail as Zamperini (Jack O\u2019Connell),\r\nRussell \u2018Phil\u2019 Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson) and Hugh \u2018Cup\u2019 Cuppernell (Jai\r\nCourtney) spin their plane around and take aim at the enemy feels accurate.\r\nThere\u2019s a weight to the gunfire and a fragility to the aircraft itself that\r\nconveys that these people were always a more-accurate gunsight away from\r\ntragedy. And yet there\u2019s something wrong here too. The sunset on the horizon looks\r\nlike a painting. The clouds are perfectly placed for visual impact. The little drop of blood on Zamperini\u2019s forehead can\u2019t hide\r\nhis movie star looks or movie star make-up. Everything feels accurate in its\r\nstaging, and yet also not quite genuine. It's Hollywood, old-fashioned movie accurate. And despite O\u2019Connell\u2019s instant charisma (the\r\nguy is going to be a MASSIVE star), this feeling never leaves \u201cUnbroken\u201d\u2014the sense\r\nthat we\u2019re watching human suffering that looks too pretty and too refined to\r\nconvey its intended impact. Louis Zamperini should have become a household name for his\r\nathletic ability. The \u201cTorrance Tornado\u201d was a US Olympic athlete whose career\r\nwas cut short when he joined World War II as a bombardier. Even in country,\r\nZamperini is seen training, pushing himself right at the moment that most\r\npeople would give up. He is the kind of runner who hangs back, and only makes\r\nhis move when everyone has reached the point of exhaustion. Of course, this is\r\na character trait that will serve him well during the nightmare he\u2019s about to\r\nendure. Zamperini and two other men, including Phil, survive a plane crash in the\r\nmiddle of the Pacific Ocean. They barely make it long enough to board a raft,\r\nwhere the conditions of hunger, dehydration and heat exhaustion take their\r\ntoll. These scenes are remarkably well-staged and executed by director Angelina Jolie\r\nand her team. They\u2019re the best in the film, the moments in which we can feel\r\nZamperini\u2019s increasing desperation and likely death. They have a focus, fragility and purpose that the second half of the film lacks. Advertisement That begins when Zamperini is captured after 47 days adrift,\r\nand forced into horrific conditions and hard labor in Japanese Prisoner of War\r\ncamps. Here, Jolie simply fails to convey the danger and what\u2019s truly at stake. \u201cUnbroken\u201d\r\nstarts to go through the motions of history recreation instead of real character drama, and while I have loved Roger Deakins\u2019 work in\r\nthe past, it\u2019s too \u201cpretty\u201d here, covering every shot in that vague beige of\r\nWWII memory, which never allows us to put ourselves in Zamperini\u2019s speedy shoes. If we\r\ncan\u2019t feel the urgency of his plight, we won\u2019t have the same emotional response\r\nto it as we would with more blood, more dirt, and just more danger. It becomes\r\nsomething we watch instead of something we experience. There's a difference. The relative disappointment of \u201cUnbroken\u201d has nothing to do with\r\nJack O\u2019Connell, a truly gifted actor who has emerged as a fully-formed movie\r\nstar with this, his even better work in \u201cStarred Up,\u201d and next year\u2019s great \u201c\u201971.\u201d\r\nHe may not be a household name yet. He will be. In fact, he\u2019s so good that one\r\nwishes Jolie asked more of him. Gleeson also deserves praise for taking a\r\nsmaller role and making it memorable. He too is an actor really worth watching.\r\n\u201cUnbroken\u201d could be a film that we look back on as an early entry in the\r\ncareers of major stars. Because the disappointing thing is we won\u2019t really look back\r\nat the film itself on its own merits. It\u2019s one of those inspirational Hollywood\r\ndramas about which there isn\u2019t anything \"overtly wrong\" with it. It\u2019s well-cast,\r\nit looks great, it has that intense centerpiece in the raft, and it certainly\r\nconveys a true story worth telling. And yet I keep coming back to that\r\nbeautiful sunrise that opens the film. It\u2019s just too damn pretty.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Clapper", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "\"The\u00a0Clapper\", directed by Dito Montiel, is an adaptation of his 2007 novel Eddie Krumble is the\u00a0Clapper, about a guy who makes a sparse living as a professional \"clapper,\" those people hired to applaud or ask pre-planned questions in infomercial audiences. In the novel, real-life late night host Jay Leno notices that the same guy is in the audience at all of these different infomercials, so he starts a nationwide quest to discover the man's identity. The anonymous Eddie becomes a media sensation. It's a pretty thin premise on which to base a movie (or a novel, for that matter). There's a critique in there somewhere about innocent humans getting devoured by the celebrity-driven media culture, but \"The\u00a0Clapper\" is so poorly done, its tone so lackadaisical and uncommitted, it's not clear half the time what you're even watching. If it's supposed to be a comedy, it's not funny. If it's supposed to be a satire, it doesn't know what it's satirizing. The biggest problem is that the stakes are never high enough to invest in any of it. Advertisement Ed Helms plays Eddie, a guy content with his gig as a \"clapper,\" traveling to and from the various studio lots with his fellow\u00a0clapper\u00a0Chris (Tracy Morgan), and practicing his \"spontaneous\" questions in the mirror at home. Eddie is not a struggling actor who dreams of being De Niro. He likes the gig as it is. He has a crush on Judy (Amanda Seyfried), who works at a nearby gas station. He visits her there and they share awkward banter through the thick glass screen of her booth. There are no real obstacles for this couple (he likes her, she likes him), and when an obstacle comes it is completely manufactured. Of course, Ed is given a sad backstory, but you never feel like Eddie has come from anywhere. It's hard to \"invest\" in a character who doesn't want much. Judy is given \"quirks\"\u2014she owns a goat with one horn, for example\u2014but \"quirky\" doesn't equal \"interesting.\"\u00a0 The first 15 minutes of the movie shows Eddie's experiences as a\u00a0clapper. Alan Thicke plays the smooth-talking host of one of the infomercials. Leah Remini plays the woman who organizes the clappers, handing out checks, making sure everyone applauds with gusto. Brenda Vaccaro plays Eddie's mother, leaving him clueless messages on his answering machine about his busy television career. Chris and Eddie do everything together, although it's hard to describe their relationship as a friendship. Neither of them appear to have any other friends. Then, randomly, late-night host Jayme Stillerman (Russell Peters) creates a \"bit\" out of Eddie's background appearances, and a nationwide \"manhunt\" begins, Eddie's face appearing on billboards surrounded by the words \"WHO IS THE\u00a0CLAPPER?\" This unwanted notoriety gets in the way of his fledgling romance with Judy, and he discovers fame\u2014which he never wanted in the first place\u2014is not fun. In the television series \"Extras,\" Ricky Gervais used the movie extra sub-culture to lampoon show business as a whole. Punctuated by cameos from huge stars playing themselves (Kate Winslet, Ben Stiller, Samuel Jackson), the series made fun of its characters but also went after the competitiveness that makes the larger industry so ugly, not at just the A-List level but the extras level too. When Gervais' character actually does get a break and writes a hit TV show, he finds that fame is not all it's cracked up to be. \"The Extras\" did what \"The Clapper\" doesn't do. It used its sub-culture as a way to explore its themes, of fame, need, drive, ambition. It had a strong point of view about its subject. \"The Clapper\", however, uses its sub-culture as only semi-interesting background for the romance between Ed and Judy, so unromantic that when they declare themselves to one another they have to keep repeating their lines as though they need convincing. There's nothing to hold onto here. \"The Clapper\" isn't about anything.  The cast of is made up of very talented actors. But when even Tracy Morgan seems underwater, when even he doesn\u2019t have one funny moment, you know something is really wrong.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Lucy", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Imagine a stranger-in-a-strange-land revenge thriller about a wide-eyed Anglo bombshell (Scarlett Johansson) who gets kidnapped and abused in Taiwan by nasty, sweaty, shouting Korean gangsters and then escapes to seek justice. Then imagine this same movie starring, say, a lightning fast kick boxer who can knock a dozen opponents' teeth out before they can raise a single fist. Now imagine this same movie injected with a dose of apocalyptic science fiction, with the woman gaining strange powers as the story unfolds. Then envision midnight-movie touches mixed into the filmmaking: flash cuts of predators and prey enhancing otherwise typical scenes of plans being hatched; monologues about brain capacity and the true meaning of time coupled with psychedelic visions and wormholes and explanatory objects materializing from thin air.\u00a0 Advertisement That's Luc Besson's \"Lucy,\" a thriller about an American woman who gets kidnapped into service as a drug mule bearing an experimental synthetic hormone, accidentally absorbs some of it, then sheds her physical, intellectual and perceptual limitations.\u00a0I could describe five or six other kinds of movies that in some way also echo \"Lucy.\" Sections may remind you of the original \"The Matrix\" and the last hour of \"Akira,\" and the final ten minutes play like a Greatest Hits of science-fiction \"trip\" movies. You've seen a lot of the individual situations and filmmaking techniques in \"Lucy\" as well. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to identify one idea, scene or element in the picture that is not a cliche. \u00a0 But the total package feels fresh. From the minute that Johansson's title character suffers a beating in captivity that ruptures the drugs in her stomach and releases them into her bloodstream (a Yankee nightmare), the film enters a realm of continual delight, though not always surprise. There's no point naming any of the other major characters, as there really are no other characters, only types: the arrogant fat-cat drug dealer (Choi Min-Sik) who thinks he can control the short blond drug mule and learns the hard way that he can't; the brilliant, deep-voiced scientist (Morgan Freeman, who else?) whose theoretical studies of the human brain's untapped potential make him an information source and then finally a kind of partner-savior to Lucy; the handsome nice-guy Parisian cop (Amr Waked) who assists Lucy during her climactic mission to acquire more of the experimental hormone to ingest and become whatever it is that she's becoming: a 1950s sci-fi monster, probably\u2014the kind that cannot be killed because everything you shoot at it makes it stronger and hungrier. Lucy is little more than a type herself\u2014a representative of humanity in its un-mutated, non-super state. Johannson's mid-career transformation from husky-voiced ingenue to intensely physical matinee idol is one of the more fascinating arcs in American cinema. It's only her control over her body, voice and eyes\u2014and maybe our awareness that her performances in this movie, \"Her\" and \"Under the Skin\" are all of a piece; Lucy even uses the phrase \"under the skin\" at one point!\u2014that stops \"Lucy\" from being tiresome. Her work keeps us from realizing that Besson's script has botched the chance to tell a deeper story, one that's not just bombastically exciting and superficially clever, but quietly tragic. Advertisement \"Lucy\" starts with shots of the prehistoric ape-woman Lucy and periodically returns to her throughout the story, not-too-subtly comparing the heroine's transformation to that of the species itself (\"from evolution to revolution,\" to quote one of the script's more pungent phrases).\u00a0And yet there are only two moments that make us really understand and empathize with Lucy as something other than a cipher who represents the un-evolved human. One is an early scene of her being terrorized and abused by Taiwanese drug thugs: Lucy's abject helplessness here is hard to watch. The other occurs deeper in the story when Lucy realizes she's about to embark on a terrifying and probably one-way transformative journey and phones her mom. The scene is shot mostly in tight closeup. The dialogue has a goofy Proustian boldness: \"I remember the taste of your milk in my mouth ... I want to thank you for a thousand kisses that I can feel on my face.\"\u00a0 That scene is so brazenly powerful that in retrospect it made me wish the main character had gone on a journey with more emotional gradations. Heck, I'd have settled for more than the two that Besson deigns to give us: \"Oh, my God, these guys want to kill me\" and \"I am God, watch me kill these guys.\" When the hormones enter Lucy's bloodstream it's as if a switch has been flipped. The heroine starts speaking in monotone and tilting her head at looming men like a quizzical bird regarding a worm that it's about to devour. She's woman-as-Terminator. The Terminator is a great movie monster, but there's a reason why it's a supporting character in the films that bear its name. Like many films by Besson\u2014\"The Professional,\" \"The Fifth Element,\" \"The Messenger\" and other high-octane shoot-'em-ups\u2014\"Lucy\" starts out riveting but becomes less engaging as it goes along. It keeps introducing potentially rich narrative veins and then failing to tap them. It too often falls back on gunplay and gore just when you think it might finally delve into the notions that it keeps serving up with such fanfare (the falseness of the idea of uniqueness; the self-defeating nature of a species \"more concerned with having than being\"; time as \"the one true unit of measure\"). \u00a0 Advertisement Nevertheless: \"Lucy\" is a fun, confident work. It's fast and tight and playful even when it's sadistic and violent, which is often. It lasts about 90 minutes and change but feels longer in a good way, because every second is packed tight. It's full of itself, yet it still keeps winking at you. It wants to be taken seriously, but not so seriously that you don't laugh at (and with) the sight of Lucy strolling into a gunfight wearing nosebleed heels, or making enemies writhe like marionettes on invisible strings.

{"Title": "Blade Runner 2049", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "Over 163 stylish minutes, \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d wrestles with nothing less than what it means to be human, serving as a beautiful thematic companion to Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d a film that redefined a genre. It\u2019s too soon to tell if the follow-up will have the influence and staying power of the groundbreaking original but it\u2019s clear from the beginning that this no mere piece of nostalgic fan service. Unlike a lot of reboots or long-delayed sequels that merely remix the themes and characters of the beloved original to give viewers the hollow comfort of familiarity, Denis Villeneuve and his team are remarkably ambitious, using the topics raised by \u201cBlade Runner\u201d to continue the conversation instead of just repeating it to make a buck. To that end, they have made one of the most deeply philosophical and challenging sci-fi films of all time, a movie that never holds your hand as it spirals the viewer through its gorgeous funhouse of the human soul. Advertisement Here\u2019s where things get a little tricky for a film critic. Villeneuve and the team at Warner Brothers have asked critics to be incredibly precious with spoilers, not even revealing things that the film does mere minutes into its running time (and even a couple things I believe the trailers give away, but whatever). The way the film reveals its secrets, themes, and connections is one of its greatest strengths, so I\u2019ll heed that directorial request, although I suspect some of the best writing about this film will be done when its themes can be discussed beat by beat and explicitly.    Until then, I\u2019ll just give you the very basics, as beautiful as they are. Riding a wave of gorgeous visuals from the legendary Roger Deakins and a crack effects team, Villeneuve brings us to Los Angeles in 2049. It\u2019s been decades since the action of the first film, but the replicant-destroying Blade Runner is still a profession, personified here by Ryan Gosling as an agent known as K. His duty now is to track down old replicants who have gone into hiding, living long past their originally-programmed lifespan. In the film\u2019s opening, Officer K tracks down a replicant who is just trying to live a peaceful life as a farmer (a spectacled Dave Bautista, doing a great deal with a small role). What he finds there will start what is essentially a detective story, spurring K to solve a mystery about his own past, the history of replicants, the power of memory, and what it means to be a human being. Robin Wright, Jared Leto, and Harrison Ford co-star.    From the minute footage of \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d started to leak, it was clear that the director of \u201cPrisoners\u201d and \u201cArrival\u201d had created a film with a confident, strong visual language. The Oscar talk for the always-an-Academy-bridesmaid Roger Deakins started with the first trailer. The film is undeniably gorgeous, the kind of work that could be appreciated with the volume turned all the way down. Not only are Deakins and Villeneuve great at the \u201cfuturistic\u201d aspects of their vision, but they\u2019ve made a film whose most striking imagery often relates to nature. When I think of \u201c2049,\u201d I think of waves crashing, snow falling, and, of course, rain pelting down\u2014an iconic image from the first film that\u2019s almost subverted here in the second half. And Villeneuve and Deakins are often playful within this visually striking\u00a0world, capturing images that work thematically\u2014I think of a \u201csmall\u201d K against gigantic statues at a point when he\u2019s questioning his place in the world or a moment with a hologram that comes off a billboard to remind him of what he\u2019s lost in a fashion that\u2019s ten stories tall\u2014while never losing sight of the pure beauty of it all. It\u2019s one of the most stunningly shot films of not just this year, but the last several. I can\u2019t wait to just see it again, just to bask in its visuals without trying to follow its plot. And the sound design is so remarkable that it\u2019s almost overwhelming\u2014this is a film you don\u2019t passively watch, you experience it.    Advertisement Don\u2019t worry\u2014this is no hollow visual spectacle. It\u2019s grounded at the same time. As he did with Amy Adams in \u201cArrival\u201d and Benicio Del Toro in \u201cSicario,\u201d Villeneuve proves his skill with performance as well, particularly with Ryan Gosling, who gives one of the best performances of his career. Gosling is perfect for this part as he\u2019s always had a vulnerability underneath\u00a0the handsome fa\u00e7ade, and he allows fear and confusion to become operating forces on K\u2019s arc without ever overselling the deep emotion of the piece. It\u2019s a fantastic performance, and Villeneuve draws great ones from Sylvia Hoeks and Ana de Armas as well. The film did drag a little for me near the end of the first hour when I wanted it to pick up the pace, and some of the characters feel like they do things dictated by plot necessity more than believable behavior, but that's a criticism that could fade on repeat viewing. It would have been incredibly easy to reboot \u201cBlade Runner\u201d directly, merely continuing Deckard and Rachel\u2019s story from the first movie or even (gasp) remaking it. And yet while hundreds of writers and filmmakers were inspired by \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d it\u2019s hard to believe any of them could have found a way to expand its legacy as completely as Villenueve does here with a movie that doesn't feel at all repetitive. He\u2019s in no way seeking to improve or replace\u2014the films now work together, enriching each other instead of mimicking. They ask timeless questions and, like all great films, refuse to give you all the answers, allowing viewers to debate and discuss their meaning instead of merely being passive recipients of mindless entertainment. In that sense, \"Blade Runner 2049\" answers one of its own questions about what it means to be human\u2014to have free thought\u2014and how vital it is to appreciate art so clearly designed to enrich the soul.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "The Bronze", "Stars": 1.5, "Review": "\u201cThe Bronze\u201d is to a motion picture as near-beer is to an alcoholic beverage: that is, it is not quite a motion picture. Whether or not you are a fan of its performers might be the determining factor as to whether you find it a \u201cnear movie\u201d or \"not even a movie\"; for this viewer, it was way more the latter, as witnessed by the fact that this ostensibly edgy comedy didn\u2019t wring a single laugh out of me until maybe fifteen minutes before the finale.\u00a0 This picture, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2015, is actually not unusual in its utter slackness. In fact, if my memory serves me well, this kind of half-baked concoction is now a Sundance staple, and the dirty little secret of the indie film. Here\u2019s how it works: a comedic talent concocts an abrasive character, a really abrasive character, a character that can get jaws dropping and butts squirming in seats at an improv sketch theater or some such place. Comedic talent then decides it might be a neat idea to construct an entire movie around this character. Only in the process, considerations such as credibility, scene construction, story pacing, and many more staples of conventional narrative cinema are left curbside (and when I call such concoctions half-baked, I remember that it is not an accident they invariably contain at least one prominent gag or set piece involving cannabis) in favor of More Outrageous Stuff for the abrasive character to do.\u00a0 Advertisement In \u201cThe Bronze,\u201d the abrasive character is Hope Annabelle Greggory, conceived and portrayed by Melissa Rauch, known for her sharp one-liners on VH1\u2019s \u201cBest Week Ever\u201d and now as a squeaky-and-sassy nerd girlfriend on \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d Hope is a former Olympic gymnast, celebrated in her Ohio small town for capturing the bronze medal back in the day. Now, her career prematurely ended by injury, she lives on dwindling endorsement earnings and by stealing money from the mail delivered by her postman father (Gary Cole). We first see the latter-day Hope lying in bed, masturbating as she watches the video of her prize-winning Olympic performance. As an orgasm-chaser, she snorts up a bunch of crushed-up painkiller pills. This sets the bar for the character\u2019s abrasiveness, so to speak; nevertheless, one is still unnerved at the frequency with which Hope curses out her dad, and the way she refers to a former high school classmate with a neurological disorder as \u201cTwitchy\u201d to his face.\u00a0 As it happens, co-writer Rauch and director Bryan Buckley know, or think they know, enough about movies to realize that they are obliged to create a redemptive story arc for Holly. So they do, to the extent that \u201cTwitchy,\u201d played by Thomas Middleditch of \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d actually becomes Holly\u2019s romantic interest as she softens up by training a young Olympic hopeful who could, Holly understands, steal her own small-town thunder. The movie\u2019s jokes take uncertain aim at the shallowness and corruption of televised athletics. While there\u2019s a certain potential irony in Upright Citizens Brigade-types getting snooty about jocks, as it were, this is not something considered in the movie\u2019s philosophy.\u00a0 The most talked-about scene in the movie comes near the end, in the form of a slapstick sex scene that\u2019s rather like the one in \u201cTeam America: World Police,\u201d with the novelty of it being enacted by actual people\u2014the actors portraying the characters or maybe their stunt doubles or some combination thereof, the lighting makes it hard to tell\u2014and it\u2019s not only not particularly funny, it\u2019s tonally so discordant from the already incoherent movie that it\u2019s \u2026 well, \u201cconfusing\u201d isn\u2019t the right word. \u201cUpsetting\u201d isn\u2019t, either, as one has kind of stopped caring by this point. Hard to say what the right word is. But it\u2019s not a good one.\u00a0 Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Death Note", "Stars": 1.0, "Review": "I don\u2019t subscribe to the theory that adaptations of artistically successful source material need remain overly faithful. An adaptation, at its best, should also be an interpretation. It should offer a personal take, a new angle, deepening certain themes while naturally reducing others, etc. However, the decisions made when radically altering source material should feel purposeful, not arbitrary and random. It\u2019s not so much when our favorite books are adapted differently that makes fans angry but when they are lessened by the differences. Such is the case with Adam Wingard\u2019s depressingly awful \u201cDeath Note,\u201d premiering today on Netflix. Several of the changes to Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata\u2019s brilliant manga have already been widely reported, including the whitewashing of the entire project by relocating it from Japan to Seattle, but those are just the symptoms of a greater disease known as complete creative bankruptcy. Advertisement The concept of \u201cDeath Note,\u201d the manga and at least start of the film, is simple. A boy named Light Turner (Nat Wolff) finds a book dropped to Earth by a Shinigami, a Japanese death demon somewhat akin to the Grim Reaper, named Ryuk, voiced in the film by Willem Dafoe. The book says Death Note on the cover and has names written in it over centuries. It also has the rules. Write someone\u2019s name in the book and they will die. In the manga, the rules are extensive and repeated often, but Wingard and writers Charley Parlapanides & Vlas Parlapanides and Jeremy Slater understandably simplify things a bit. In the movie, Light writes a name and a manner of death and it unfolds in front of his eyes. That's about all you need to know. What would you do with that kind of power? In the manga, Light begins testing his own morality by killing criminals, allowing them to die peacefully of heart attacks as he tests the boundaries of playing God. Perhaps recognizing this wouldn\u2019t be thrilling enough for a horror film, the \u201cDeath Note\u201d movie becomes a gorefest almost immediately. Light decides to see if a school bully will truly be decapitated if he writes that on a blank page, and Wingard gleefully stages the ensuing carnage like he\u2019s planning to reboot the \u201cFinal Destination\u201d franchise next. In the film version, Light does move back to \u201cjustified murder,\u201d but even those are Horror Extreme, taking out the man who got away with killing Light\u2019s mother and a criminal holding hostages\u2014both in brutal ways.  The biggest change in the film version of \u201cDeath Note\u201d is the inclusion of a romantic arc with another high school girl named Mia (Margaret Qualley), who is quickly let in on the Angel of Death Game because Light has a crush on her. (One could\u00a0argue that this character is a version of the manga's Misa Amane, an eventual companion for Light in the books but the character's history and purpose are radically different.)\u00a0And the pair soon get a nemesis in the mysterious \u201cL\u201d (Keith Stanfield), who tracks the God of Death known in the press as Kira. One of the best elements of the manga was the cat-and-mouse between Kira/Light and L, but that\u2019s greatly diffused here by the addition of Mia and the changes made to Light\u2019s family, including his police chief father (Shea Whigham).\u00a0 Advertisement And here\u2019s where we get back to the fatal flaw of \u201cDeath Note\u201d: it doesn\u2019t feel like any of these alterations to the source material, and there are many of them, had true artistic or thematic purpose. Why make this or that change? Why add this character or change this plot point? If there\u2019s no true answer, it\u2019s all just a hollow exercise. And the biggest problem is that Wingard and company clearly refused to make Light the antihero he needed to be, and so they add a love interest and pervert the entire concept, leaving the project hollow at its center. Wingard has been a gifted, exciting genre director before with works like \u201cThe Guest\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re Next,\u201d but this is misguided in every way. It could be due to years of rewrites of a massive piece of source material, but this movie is a mess on every level, particularly its script.\u00a0The dialogue truly sucks\u2014\u201cWe could change the world.\u201d \u201cWe? As in us?\u201d\u2014but, worst of all, Wingard and his writers never figured out what to do with Ryuk. Yes, a spiky demon voiced by Willem Dafoe is actually boring. Ryuk is a great character, a wisecracking demon who\u2019s fascinated with the flexible morality of human beings. The film version doesn\u2019t know what to do with him, sidelining him until it\u2019s time to turn him into a plot point. Even Ryuk himself looks bored.\u00a0Given the weird bursts of humor and eccentricity in the final project (ex., L\u2019s partner-in-crimesolving Watari sings him \u201cOptimistic Voices\u201d from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d to put him to sleep), it\u2019s stunning how few of them come courtesy of Ryuk. In fact, when the oddity of the \u201cL\u201d character is injected into the film (and, to be fair, Stanfield is, as he often is, the best thing about this project) one realizes just how tonally screwed the whole thing is.\u00a0 Most depressingly, given the quality of some of his work (even \"Blair Witch\" has some interesting pieces), the filmmaking here is sporadic, amateurish and haphazard. Wingard verges on black comedy but then pulls back, unsure of what the tone should be of the piece overall. The final scenes are so horrendously constructed and edited that one has to believe the project was rushed or re-shot. And the ending will have you switching off your Netflix app in disgust. If you don't die from boredom before you get there. Advertisement", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Jason Bourne", "Stars": 2.0, "Review": "\u201cJason Bourne\u201d may entice ticket buyers with prospects of a creative and adrenalin-pumping reunion between Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass, a duo that went beyond typical blockbuster expectations\r\nwith \u201cThe Bourne Supremacy\u201d and \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum.\u201d Being a fan of both of\r\nthose movies, I too had high hopes for a return to form for the character who\r\nshares a monogram with 007. But it\u2019s mere minutes into \u201cJason Bourne\u201d that something is wrong. Is it the stoic, nearly dialogue-less (25 lines in the\r\nentire film) take on Bourne? Is it the more-hyperactive-than-ever action\r\ncinematography and editing, designed to make every phone call answered and\r\nstrident walk taken seem important?\r\nHow about the familiarity of a plot that literally echoes questions these\r\ncharacters have already asked and answered? \u201cJason Bourne\u201d is a film I kept trying to like. It just wouldn\u2019t let me. Advertisement After learning the truth of his progression from David Webb\r\nto superspy Jason Bourne in the previous two Greengrass films and, of course,\r\nDoug Liman\u2019s \u201cThe Bourne Identity,\u201d JB (Matt Damon) is essentially in hiding.\r\nSure, he pops up for the occasional street fight, but he\u2019s a loner, the kind of\r\nguy with no current attachments, deeply off the grid. (It\u2019s worth\r\nnoting that Greengrass and co-writer Christopher Rouse are just barely\r\ninterested in setting up where Bourne has been and what he\u2019s up to in 2016.) It\u2019s\r\nmere minutes before Nicky (Julia Stiles) drags Bourne back on the radar of\r\nthe nefarious Powers That Be, this time personified by CIA Director Robert\r\nDewey (Tommy Lee Jones). Nicky wants to give Bourne even more of the background\r\nbehind the Treadstone project, particularly the details about what really\r\nhappened to Bourne\u2019s father, Richard Webb (Gregg Henry). Of course, Dewey can\u2019t let that happen, and he plans to use\r\nCIA agent Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) and an assassin known merely as \u201cAsset\u201d\r\n(Vincent Cassel) to keep his undercover dealings undercover. One of the reasons\r\nthat Dewey is particularly panicked about the return of Bourne is that he\u2019s\r\nalso deeply involved with a tech pioneer named Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed,\r\ncurrently seen on HBO's \u201cThe Night Of\u201d), the head of a company called Deep Dream that promises intense levels of privacy to its customers but has been working\r\nwith the CIA in secret. \u201cJason Bourne\u201d includes several of today\u2019s\r\ngreatest hot button concerns\u2014internet privacy, government intrusion\u2014but they feel like window dressing.\u00a0 Matt Damon said in a press conference in 2007 that he thought his\r\niteration of Jason Bourne was over; he had reached the end point of his\r\ncharacter\u2019s journey, his search for his identity. He stated, \u201c\u2026 all of that\r\ninternal propulsive mechanism that drives the character is not there, so if\r\nthere was to be another one then it would have to be a complete\r\nreconfiguration, you know, where do you go from there? For me I kind of feel\r\nlike the story that we set out to tell is has now been told.\u201d He clearly still\r\nfeels that way. Damon can be a complex, character-driven actor with the right\r\nmaterial, but his heart\u2019s not in this. Tommy Lee Jones feels even less invested with the little bit of character he\u2019s been given, and poor Alicia Vikander might as well be named Plot Device in that we know exactly what her\r\narc is going to be from the minute we see her. Perhaps worst of all, Greengrass\r\nfinds a way to waste Vincent Cassel, one of our most physically vibrant and\r\nmenacing actors. Cassel does most of his acting scowling through a sniper scope, and\r\nisn\u2019t allowed to really break out until the end of the film. Only Riz Ahmed makes\r\nany impact on a performance level, doing a lot with very little\u2014watch the way\r\nhe subtly plays a successful businessman who knows the skeletons are about to\r\nfall out of his closet. There's a much better version of \"Jason Bourne\" that focuses on him, contrasting his arc as a man caught up in something greater than himself with our hero's. Advertisement Ahmed registers because one senses an urgency to his character\u2019s plight, which is not the case with the\r\nrest of the film. Rarely has there been so much intensity in the pursuit of a\r\nstory that feels like it has no stakes. When \u201cJason Bourne\u201d is done, ask yourself\r\nwhat everyone was yelling, running and fighting about. Good luck coming up\r\nwith a satisfying answer. It\u2019s as if Greengrass and company knew that they couldn't orchestrate an intriguing new arc for their beloved character, so they just repeated one. The film is like Jason Bourne fan fiction in how much it\r\ncompletely reworks things we\u2019ve seen before, only with a few more years of cyberterrorism\r\nbuzzwords to give viewers the illusion of not just depth but a plot.\u00a0 Even Greengrass\u2019 trademark style feels uninspired. Barry\r\nAckroyd (\u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d) is an undeniably talented cinematographer, but his\r\nstyle doesn\u2019t have the same kinetic energy as Oliver Wood\u2019s work in the\r\noriginal trilogy, which put us right in the middle of the action. It\u2019s a fine\r\nline, but a crucial one; Wood\u2019s camera feels urgent, as if we might get\r\npunched too, whereas Ackroyd\u2019s feels cluttered and desperate. Returning\r\neditor Christopher Rouse (who\u2019s cut all of Greengrass\u2019 films) is the technical\r\nMVP here, giving the film a propulsive energy that could convince some people they\u2019re watching something fun and exciting just by sheer force. However, when\r\nit\u2019s over, even viewers more eager to forgive this failed creative reunion will wonder what it is that they just watched, and what purpose\r\nit serves other than financial. And why no one figured out a new, engaging way\r\nto tell a story that\u2019s already been told.", "Critic": "Beta"}
{"Title": "Phoenix", "Stars": 4.0, "Review": "How do we process unimaginable betrayal? How do we overcome\r\nthe kind of events that forever alter the trajectory of a life we so\r\ndesperately want back? These are just two of the questions addressed by\r\nChristian Petzold\u2019s masterful \u201cPhoenix,\u201d a film that firmly cements its\r\ndirector as one of the most impressive working today. With echoes of \u201cVertigo,\u201d\r\nand a deeply confident visual language, Petzold\u2019s film resonates long after its\r\nperfect ending. This is a riveting piece of work that never loses sight of its\r\nhuman story while also serving as a commentary for how an entire country deals\r\nwith tragedies like war. A film this satisfying on every level\u2014one that can be\r\nenjoyed purely for its narrative while also providing material for hours of\r\ndiscussion on its themes\u2014is truly rare.  Advertisement \u201cPhoenix\u201d opens with a face profiled in darkness. It is the\r\nface of Lene (Nina Kunzendorf), a woman driving a bandaged and bloodied\r\npassenger back to Berlin. Her face has been badly damaged, but she is a\r\nsurvivor of a concentration camp. After a brief encounter at a checkpoint, the\r\npair drives further and headlights fill the screen before the title comes up.\r\nThis story will clearly be one of darkness to light, even if it\u2019s a light that\r\nsometimes blinds you. We learn that the passenger is Nelly Lenz (Petzold\u2019s\r\ncollaborator, Nina Hoss), a German-Jewish nightclub singer, who, from the\r\nappearance of photographs and discussions with friend Lene, had a happy life. She\r\nwas married to a handsome, confident man named Johnny (another Petzold regular,\r\nRonald Zehrfeld). On October 4th, Johnny was taken in for\r\nquestioning by the SS. Two days later, he was released, and Nelly was\r\ntransported to a concentration camp. Did Johnny betray his wife\u2019s Jewish\r\nbackground? Clearly. And yet Nelly refuses to believe it. She wants her old\r\nlife back. And that means denial that her husband was and is a self-serving\r\nmonster. After her plastic surgeon advises her that she can look like anyone\r\nand start a new life, she tells him, \u201cI\r\nwant to look exactly like I used to.\u201d She is defiantly, stubbornly in denial\r\nabout what has happened to her. Over Lene\u2019s objections, Nelly returns to Berlin, seeking out\r\nJohnny. She is a shattered woman in a city of rubble. She tells Lene, \u201cI no longer exist.\u201d The relationship,\r\nthe friends she now sees only in pictures, even the city she once lived in\u2014they\u2019re\r\nall gone. She finds some semblance of familiarity in Phoenix, the nightclub\r\nthat literally looks like an oasis in ruins. It\u2019s like a dream that people find\r\namidst the rubble of a bombed-out city. And that\u2019s where she finds Johnny. He\r\ngrabs her one night. He has a plan. He needs someone to pretend to be his dead\r\nwife, so he can claim her inheritance as there\u2019s no evidence that his wife is\r\ndead. \u201cYou have to play my wife.\u201d And\r\nthe parallels between \u201cPhoenix\u201d and \u201cVertigo\u201d come into strong focus as Johnny\r\nbegins to turn this woman he believes is a stranger into the wife he betrayed,\r\nand, in doing so, brings Nelly back to life. Every choice in \u201cPhoenix\u201d has been carefully considered and\r\nyet never in a way that it smothers the realism of the piece. It\u2019s a film that has a deep cinematic language that avoids calling attention to its\r\nstyle. Petzold\u2019s choices are subtle, from the way he frames the expressive\r\nfaces of his actors to the choice of \u201cNight and Day\u201d in a crucial club scene to a climactic conversation that takes place on a train track, so deeply symbolic of looking in one direction to the past and the other to the future (as well as carrying historical weight with the trains that took people like Nelly to concentration camps).\r\nDark and light, rising from the ashes, the overhead lighting or neon red of the\r\nPhoenix sign\u2014Petzold plays so subtly with visual expression of his themes that\r\nhe doesn\u2019t draw attention to them, just allows them to be the background to his\r\nhuman drama.  Advertisement And that human drama is where Nina Hoss takes center stage.\r\nWatch the scene in which she takes off her hat in a club after seeing Johnny\r\nwalk by for the first time. She calls his name, happily, even though she knows\r\nwhat he\u2019s done. It\u2019s a name she\u2019s called so many times before. He looks past\r\nher. Or maybe he looks at her and doesn\u2019t see her. She can\u2019t be there. His\r\nbrain can\u2019t even recognize the possibility that she would be. Hoss puts her\r\nhand to her mouth in horror. It\u2019s not Johnny\u2019s betrayal but Johnny\u2019s dismissal\r\nthat hurts her now. This walking embodiment of when things made sense can\u2019t see\r\nher anymore, and so when he gives her the chance to \u201cbecome Nelly\u201d again, she\r\ntakes it. At one point, Johnny asks Nelly to help craft a story about what he\r\nbelieves is her false narrative of her time in a concentration camp. Of course,\r\nthe story Nelly starts to tell is true. Hoss holds her hands to her face, shaky,\r\nunable to speak fluidly. And Johnny is equally uncomfortable. The fiction he\r\nbelieves he\u2019s creating and the reality they\u2019re both denying are starting to\r\nintersect. Hoss is simply amazing in this scene, and really throughout the film.\r\n To be fair, Zehrfeld is very good as well. Watch a moment in\r\nwhich he comes home to find Nelly in the right dress, made-up, and looking more\r\nlike Nelly of the past. Is that a moment of recognition on his face? Awareness\r\nof what he\u2019s done? No, it can\u2019t be. He can\u2019t be that person and she can\u2019t be\r\nalive. She's a ghost, a reminder of what he's done and what the entire world lost in WWII. If we're lucky, a few times a year we get as complete a package as \u201cPhoenix.\u201d\r\nWe get character studies with performances as strong as Hoss and Zehrfeld are\r\nhere every now and then, or we get auteur-driven films with complex visual choices and an emphasis on\r\nstyle. It\u2019s uncommon to see a film so balanced that it serves as a commentary\r\non the human need to deny war and betrayal while never losing sight of the\r\nstory of a pianist and nightclub singer in 1945 Berlin. \u201cPhoenix\u201d works on so many levels, it's the kind of piece that can be dissected and appreciated for decades.

{"Title": "Ned Rifle", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "Hal Hartley\u2019s often fascinating \u201cNed Rifle\u201d feels like a\r\nvery conscious nod to the films that made its writer/director famous in the\r\nlate \u201880s and early \u201890s while also serving as a commentary on moving on from\r\npast successes and failures to face the future head on. It is the work most\r\nreminiscent of his quirky, clever character studies like \u201cThe Unbelievable\r\nTruth\u201d, \u201cTrust\u201d and \u201cSimple Men\u201d in decades, and reminded me why Hartley was so\r\nformative on my view of independent cinema in high school. Like those films, \u201cNed\r\nRifle\u201d has a jangly, unique energy, as people bounce off each other and then pause to philosophically ask what the bouncing means. Dialogue comes in sporadic\r\nbursts, edging on being too self-conscious for the narrative to hold\r\ntogether (as often happened in his later films) but there\u2019s such genuine\r\naffection for the characters of \u201cNed Rifle\u201d that it never falls apart, even as\r\nthese people sometimes sound like they\u2019re commenting on other films, filmmakers and the artistic process in general.\r\nThis is also Hartley at his most loosely hilarious in years, reuniting his\r\nfavorite actors and finding a new one who seems born for the timing of his\r\ncomedy. \u201cNed Rifle\u201d, the final chapter in a strange trilogy with \u201cHenry Fool\u201d and \u201cFay\r\nGrim\u201d, is a movie about damaged people coming to terms with their damage by\r\nturning to others. And it\u2019s Hal Hartley\u2019s best movie in years. Advertisement The title character is the son of the title characters from\r\nthe other two films: Edward Rifle (Liam Aiken), who has been living in witness\r\nprotection with a very emotionally supportive reverend (Hartley regular Martin Donovan) for the\r\nlast several years while mom was in prison. One very interesting element of \u201cNed\r\nRifle\u201d is how Hartley approaches religion without the cynicism or derision\r\noften seen in independent cinema. Ned is a deeply religious young man who\r\ncarries a bible and remains chaste in the face of regular temptation. But\r\nHartley doesn\u2019t turn this trait into an object of comedy or isolationism. On the contrary, it\r\nseems to ground Ned in a way that the other, free-floating characters lack.\r\nHartley\u2019s worldview has always been an open-door one, allowing for different\r\nphilosophies and trains of thought to run parallel to each other. At the same time that Ned turns old enough to leave his\r\ngiven home, his mother Fay (Parker Posey) is being moved to a new prison. He\r\ngoes to visit her first, before moving on to find his father (Thomas Jay Ryan),\r\nwith the expressed purpose of killing him for what he did to his mother (his God is apparently a vengeful one). To\r\nfind Henry, Ned first has to track down Simon (James Urbaniak), the poet made\r\nfamous despite his general allergy to public attention. Simon is holed up in a\r\nhotel, trying to figure out his next public move while taking comedy lessons\r\nand trying to do stand-up routines online via webcam. The image of a formerly vital artist\r\ntrying to figure out what\u2019s next can quite obviously be read as a bit of self-examination\r\nby Hartley, who could be perceived as having lost some of his resonance in the\r\nworld of independent cinema. When an admirer named Susan (Aubrey Plaza, who has\r\nthe perfect rhythm for Hartley\u2019s dialogue) generally stalks her way into Simon\u2019s\r\nworld, she reveals that she has done little more than write about him for years, even\r\nlosing her job as a film critic because every review came back to the poetry of\r\nSimon Grim. It turns out that Susan also has a deep connection to Henry\u2019s past,\r\nand she hooks up with Ned to track him down.  With a simple framing style, light score and remarkably\r\nshort running time, \u201cNed Rifle\u201d zips along from beginning to end, which may\r\nleave some fans of \u201cmeatier\u201d films like \u201cHenry Fool\u201d disappointed, but there\u2019s\r\nan infectious energy that makes this one of Hartley\u2019s most likable works.

{"Title": "Win It All", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "A desperate gambler, in a financial hole, isn't trying to win, really. It's not that simple for him. He needs to win just enough\u00a0so he can break even\u00a0with the looming debts in his head, and then the slate will be wiped clean and he can walk away with a clear conscience. But! Once he beats the odds and actually wins just enough\u00a0to break even, the siren call starts up again: Why not keep going? An hour ago you were a loser. Now you're a winner. And we all know how that ends. Knowing how it all ends is the main problem with a lot of gambling movies, and \"Win It All\" is no exception. Advertisement In the third collaboration between Joe Swanberg and Jake Johnson (\"Drinking Buddies,\" \"Digging for Fire\"), chronic loser Eddie (Johnson) tries to get his act together, encouraged by his long-suffering brother, his Gamblers Anonymous sponsor, and a new romantic interest. Eddie doesn't have a job. He plays poker at night. He's always strapped for cash. From the way his brother Ron (Joe Lo Truglio) treats him, you can tell that Eddie has always been a problem, the guy who needs a loan, the guy with grandiose unrealistic plans, the guy who can't settle down. The inciting incident of \"Win It All\" occurs when a scary gangster-type named Michael (Jos\u00e9 Antonio Garc\u00eda) asks Eddie to hold onto a duffel bag for him while he does a stint in prison. He'll pay Eddie $10,000 just for keeping the bag safe. However: Eddie is not allowed to look in the bag. Eddie agrees to this condition, assuming it will be the easiest money he ever made. Michael has to know that Eddie will not be able to resist looking in that bag, right? Michael has to know that if, for example, there happened to be wads of cash in that duffel bag, then leaving it in Eddie's care would be the same thing as throwing the money away? The inevitable happens. (\"Oh no ... oh no ...\" Eddie half-laughs half-moans, when he looks in the bag and sees the piles of money.) And of course, he decides to gamble just a little bit of it, so he can pay off some debts. This goes as well as can be expected and the situation very quickly careens out of control. (Occasionally, a calculator counter shows up on the screen, showing how much he's up, how much he's down.) \"Win It All\" proceeds in a pretty predictable fashion (mainly because gambling proceeds in a predictable fashion). This is a story we all know already. Good movies about gambling (\"The Hustler,\" \"The Gambler,\"\u00a0 \"California Split,\" \"The Sting,\" \"The Cooler,\" to name a few) deal with high-stakes pressure, the mindset of gamblers, the magical thinking involved (and required). To someone who has no interest in gambling, there's something queasily awful about watching someone not know to quit while they're ahead. \"Win It All\" has a couple of entertaining sequences with an improvisatory spontaneity that\u2014when it works\u2014is the best part of Swanberg's low-key style. But overall, the film feels very slight, wispy-thin, barely there.\u00a0\"Win It All\" also has an extremely obtrusive soundtrack, but the music can't create the urgency that the film really needs. Advertisement Eddie is such a hapless loser that throughout the film, you side with those who caution Eddie to stop gambling. There's his brother, who gets him a job in the family landscaping business. Eddie actually starts to enjoy the work. Then, on a night out carousing with friends, he meets Eva (Aislinn Derbez). Eddie is at his charming expansive best that night, and she's attracted to him. Eva's a nurse and a single mother. She leads a serious life and is cautious about whom she allows into it. But Eddie makes her laugh. He's a gentleman. He's inspired to get his act together because of her. There's no teeth in any of this. \"Win It All\" flops around in generalities. The best scenes are Eddie's meet-ups with his GA sponsor Gene, played by Keegan-Michael Key as perhaps the worst \"sponsor\" in the history of sponsors. Eddie tells him his struggles, and Gene bursts out laughing. He calls Eddie an \"idiot\" over and over again. Later in the film, he makes a suggestion so inappropriate that you can tell that Gene is on the edge of a relapse himself. Key was wonderful in last year's \"Don't Think Twice\" as the improv comedian who made it big, and here he's hilarious, bold, specific. These scenes spark with an unpredictability and energy that many of the other scenes lack. For the high stakes involved, \"Win It All\" feels strictly low stakes.", "Critic": "Alpha"}
{"Title": "Spider-Man: Homecoming", "Stars": 3.0, "Review": "I am a little out of touch with the inside-baseball commentary on superhero movie and sci-fi franchises, so I have to ask the reader to indulge me a bit. I\u2019m perhaps not the best person to draw the distinction between something called \u201cfan servicing,\u201d which I understand is very, very bad, and giving an audience what it wants, which I have been told from an early age is at least kind of good. That said, I can report from where I sat at a preview screening that was evenly divided between what I suspect were sympathetic-from-the-get-go reviewers and enthusiastic fans and their families, \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d is a comprehensively crowd-pleasing success.  Advertisement This is the second movie to star Tom Holland as Spider-Man in this incarnation (after \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d). Both the superhero and his high-school-student alter-ego (or is it the other way around? That\u2019s another thing I can be hazy on) Peter Parker, are presented at their most awkwardly adolescent. In the timeline of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d begins directly after Spider-Man\u2019s participation in a superhero gang fight in 2016\u2019s \u201cCivil War.\u201d But the movie itself begins eight years prior to that, in the aftermath of Loki unleashing the Chitauri, which trashed much of NYC and the Avengers\u2019 sleek headquarters in 2012\u2019s \u201cThe Avengers.\u201d (That\u2019s a 2012 movie, and it\u2019s only 2017 now, but don\u2019t look at me, I\u2019m just going by the on-screen texts.) In the wreck of the Avengers\u2019 HQ, Michael Keaton\u2019s hard-working salvage dude Adrian Toomes is showing a colleague a drawing of the Avengers scrawled by Toomes\u2019 own ten-year-old child. Those in the audience with a familiarity with possibly fake Chekhov quotes will recognize this as the gun on the mantelpiece in Act One that is obliged to go off in Act Three, and by Odin, off it does indeed go, but it\u2019s a long way from Act One to Act Three. Soon Toomes and his crew are kicked off the site by an officious Tyne Daly and it\u2019s revealed that Tony Stark is ostensibly self-dealing by heading a government clean-up crew to handle the superhero mess. To give credit to the six screenwriters on this movie, the oodles of rather convoluted plot detail are relatively clear even if you\u2019re not super-paying-attention.  \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d sees Peter Parker being shunted aside by his adult mentors Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) to tackle the more down-to-earth challenges of high school on his own. These include Parker\u2019s pushy best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon), who wants to know all about Peter\u2019s \u201cinternship\u201d at Stark Enterprises; the High School Academic Decathlon (College Bowl for high schoolers, that is), whose captain Liz (Laura Harrier) Peter has a major crush on; and Peter\u2019s guardian Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) from whom Peter must hide his amateur crime-fighting activities as Spider Man, and protect from the possibly wayward affections of a local sandwich shop manager.  This version of Peter Parker is less cocky than the prior incarnations of recent years. He is also rather whiny a lot of he time. The Peter Parker I grew up with was agonizingly tetchy, but he didn\u2019t hunch over like a weasel whenever he had to get out of a social situation to go fight crime. While Holland hunches over with sincerity and skill, I have to admit I am not enthralled by this variation on the teen superhero\u2019s alter-ego (I don\u2019t think I got it right this time either). Peter Parker as nerd, I can roll with; Peter Parker as dork, not so much. Advertisement That said, once the movie gets all its ducks in a row (and after serving up a Queens-set crime fighting foray that highlights some of the movie\u2019s worst visual effects, looking flat-out like video game action for most of its length), it delivers some genuinely effective action/suspense set pieces, including one set in the Washington Monument that worked me up a treat. A subsequent near-disaster on the Staten Island Ferry is less effective, but does lead to the movie\u2019s most effective narrative coup. That is, the nifty Spidey suit that Stark afforded Parker is taken away, and \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d has to swing to its thrilling climax with its hero in a very low-rent outfit. Is this the opposite of \u201cfan-serving,\u201d or is it \u201cfan-serving\u201d itself, presented in a cleverly inverted form? I cannot say. I can say that the film\u2019s adaptation of one of the original \u201cSpider Man\u201d comic\u2019s most graphically exceptional scenes, from 1966\u2019s Issue 33, \u201cThe Final Chapter!\u201d um, isn\u2019t as good as the comic book was, quite honestly. But I give director Jon Watts and the other seventy thousand craftspersons involved in this production credit for trying.  I can\u2019t emphasize enough that these are my personal impressions, and I understand they are probably going to be out of step with those of the masses of people who are going to attend this movie and have a good time with it. This is a picture designed to provide bright vivid thrills and breezy bits of amusement. As someone who\u2019s kind of trained to notice such things, I might say \u201cThis movie really wastes the talents of Hannibal Buress and Martin Starr\u201d; whereas a less concerned person will see these performers and say, \u201cOh yeah, those guys are funny.\u201d Marvel movies are not concerned with altering your precious bodily fluids. This one is a slightly better than average example of the species. Watch it in good health.", "Critic": "Gamma"}

Reckless, fearless, joyous, always-moving youth.  Advertisement We meet Star (Sasha Lane) in a dumpster, looking for food.\r\nQuickly, she encounters a group of teenagers in a nearby mega-store and sees a\r\nchance to escape her unhappy home life. This group of smiling, jumping, dancing\r\npeople, led by a flirtatious Jake (Shia LaBeouf), offer a way out for Star.\r\nWhere they\u2019re going to take her isn\u2019t as important as the idea that they\u2019re\r\ngoing somewhere, anywhere other than here. She learns that Jake is one of the\r\nleaders of the group, who travel the country selling magazines door to door.\r\nThey really just do it enough to get food and lodging so they can keep doing\r\nit. They\u2019re living day to day\u2014partying, drinking, and singing their way across\r\nthe country. \u00a0 There are scant few traditional narrative elements to \u201cAmerican\r\nHoney.\u201d There\u2019s a bit of a villain in Riley Keough\u2019s Krystal, the head of the\r\nmagazine sales group who collects the cash and makes the assignments. And there\u2019s\r\nan inevitable bit of a love story between Star and Jake, although it\u2019s not a\r\nfilm anyone could call a romance. This is a not a film tied to plot. It often\r\nfollows Star on adventures in the magazine sales trade, bringing her back to\r\nthe group after random encounters across the country.

It\r\ncreates a privacy, a sense that we\u2019re in the van with Star and the rest of the\r\ngang, joining them on this journey. And Arnold and cinematographer Robbie Ryan\r\noften shoot their teenagers from below, casting them larger than life against\r\nthe blue sky.

{"Title": "Belle", "Stars": 2.5, "Review": "When he lectured on literature at Cornell University, Vladimir Nabokov referred to Jane Austen\u2019s 1814 novel \"Mansfield Park\" as a \"fairy tale,\" a term he did not use disparagingly. He also obliquely noted that none of its fairy-tale romantic doings would have been possible were its characters not somewhat affluent, and that the source of the money that affords the characters their modes of living is \"cheap slave labor.\" The observation is a bracing one. But it\u2019s true that the economic system that guaranteed the incomes of the moneyed characters in Austen\u2019s world was a criminal one, even if Austen herself remained neutral on the topic. And it is uncomfortable to think that the template for the rom-com was built on...well, do I have to spell it out for you? The new movie \"Belle,\" which claims, like so many such efforts, to be based on actual events, is a novel work in that it takes on a topic not regularly treated in period drama, that is, the necessarily fraught place of a free black woman in proper British society in the late 18th/early 19th centuries. Advertisement Directed by Amma Asante from a script by Misan Sagay, \"Belle\" tells the story of an illegitimate mulatto child, daughter of a Royal Navy man, who\u2019s raised in affluence, lavishly educated, and rather condescendingly doted upon by the extended family her father foisted her upon. Once the girl, named Belle by her father but called Dido by her uncle and aunts, reaches adulthood (at which point she is incarnated by the lovely and capable young actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw), her marriage prospects seem...well, unusual. Good thing she\u2019s got a guaranteed income, something her white not-exactly-sister Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) does not, for reasons that a thorough reader of Jane Austen novels could probably guess at correctly.  As it happens, Dido\u2019s uncle Lord Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson) is a judge, and in the main part of the film\u2019s story, he\u2019s hearing a case involving a slave ship and the question of whether human beings can be insured like cargo. Dido hears about the case in dribs and drabs, and then in more detail from a neighbor, a passionate vicar\u2019s son (Sam Reid) who\u2019s under Lord Mansfield\u2019s tutelage, at least until they have a violent disagreement on the main issue of the case. Dido\u2019s consciousness grows, as does her attraction to the vicar\u2019s son. But at the same time, Dido\u2019s aunts, played by Emily Watson and Penelope Wilton, seek to steer Dido into an engagement with Oliver Ashford (James Norton), son of a very scheming grand dame (Miranda Richardson, of course) and younger brother to a bug-eyed bigoted quasi-rotter (Tom Felton, who seems not at all concerned by the fact that he\u2019s lately being cast as a Draco Malfoy For All Seasons).  The movie is intelligently written and well-acted, but it doesn\u2019t sit all that comfortably between the two stools of Austenesque Romance and Socially Conscious Drama. Although director Asante herself is a woman of color her shooting style is as conventional as any veteran director you can, or can\u2019t, name. Take the whole opening sequence, for instance, in which a sense of intrigue and drama is (putatively) built in a series of shots in which no faces are seen, merely feet and ankles taking strides, the backs of heads moving forward, hands opening carriage doors, and so on. All very stock, all very expected, at least if you\u2019ve seen such montages as many times as I. So while \"Belle\" is of undeniable interest in some respects, its overall execution restricts it from being as engaging as it wants to be, and as wrenching as perhaps it ought.\u00a0  Advertisement", "Critic": "Gamma"}
{"Title": "Dirty Grandpa", "Stars": 0.0, "Review": "A couple of weeks ago I had the strangest dream. I dreamed that this movie, \u201cDirty Grandpa,\u201d was the talk of the nation. Not because the Robert De Niro/Zac Efron/Aubrey Plaza raunch comedy was particularly good, but because, apparently\u2014I didn\u2019t see any of the movie in my dream, just had conversations with people about it\u2014it didn\u2019t do that thing that studio-produced-raunch comedies do, which is take things so far and no further. No. In my dream, \u201cDirty Grandpa\u201d was spinning heads because it broached John Waters/Harmony Korine levels of outrageousness. The sex scenes between De Niro and Plaza had a \u201cLast Tango In Paris\u201d level of explicitness, for instance.\u00a0 Advertisement Now you just have to take my word for it that I had this dream, but honestly, I did. The question is WHY did I have this dream. As the author of a book on De Niro, I\u2019m frequently (okay, not that frequently, but more often than would be the case for a guy who hadn\u2019t written a book on De Niro) asked what I make of his various career moves. So maybe the dream speaks to my critical desire to see De Niro go back to surprising his audiences with audacious performances. Or maybe I\u2019m just a perv who wants to see Aubrey Plaza naked. I don\u2019t know. The weird thing is, although the non-oneiric \u201cDirty Grandpa\u201d does not feature Aubrey Plaza naked (although she gets closer than one might have expected), the movie is, as in my dream, a genuine envelope-pusher. Its crudity is relentless. The subjects of its indifferently crafted and callously executed jokes include roofie-ing, crack smoking, child molestation, jailhouse rape, graphic depictions of penises in the shape of a swastika being displayed to a rabbi, and more. The sort of thing you might expect in a John Waters or Harmony Korine film.  Only in a John Waters or Harmony Korine film the jokes might be funny, or pointed. Here they are not. Early in the film\u2019s road trip, De Niro\u2019s horny patriarch is trying to charm some ladies on a golf course; on being stymied by uptight soon-to-be-married lawyer grandson Efron, he responds with a panoply of puns based on the term, if you\u2019ll excuse it, \u201ccock blocker.\u201d \u201cWho does your taxes, H. and R. Cockblock?\u201d De Niro asks Efron. He continues by making a salacious play on the name \u201cJack Nicklaus,\u201d putting a D where the N customarily is. Because they\u2019re at a golf course, get it? That De Niro delivers these moronic japes with gusto, even vehemence, does not improve them.\u00a0 The fact that the relentless barrage of this humor is occasionally punctuated with pointedly insincere homilies wherein \u201cdirty\u201d grandpa De Niro tries to encourage sellout grandson Efron to Follow His Dreams just makes the whole thing that more depressing. The other way the film pushes the envelope is through sheer, contemptuous incoherence. De Niro\u2019s character, Dick, is initially so homophobic and racist that one can actually imagine that he\u2019s a senior citizen Travis Bickle; having been domesticated for forty or so years, now on the death of his wife, he can let loose again, spewing epithets and rancor all the way from Georgia to Daytona Beach. Once Dick and Efron\u2019s Jason run into Jason\u2019s former college pal Shadia (Zoey Deutch, who here seems to be filling the function of \u201can Isla Fisher type\u201d) and her oversexed pal Lenore (Plaza) and their gay African-American pal Bradley (Jeffrey Bower-Champion), you can take a wild guess who ends up the brunt of Dick\u2019s dickish one-liners. Once the movie backs into a weird corner that skirts the hem of the infamous \u201cmind if we dance with your dates?\u201d scene in \u201cAnimal House,\u201d De Niro\u2019s character suddenly turns righteous in the ways of sexual tolerance even as he\u2019s humiliating a rougher black character. The movie\u2019s editing ADD is so severe that the aforementioned roofie-ing gag (actually a variation thereof, with Xanax substituting for Rohypnol, if anybody\u2019s counting) leads into a chugging-contest scene so incoherently edited that the joke, such as it is, has no payoff. As the wisecracking robots on \u201cMystery Science Theater 3000\u201d used to say, \u201cThey just didn\u2019t care.\u201d\u00a0 Advertisement The movie is so incredibly consistent in failing to land an honest laugh that about an hour into it, its not being funny becomes laughable: I began giggling with a kind of metaphysical embarrassment for everyone involved in the enterprise, and, eventually, for all of humanity itself. I see, scrawled in my notebook, the words \u201cWhat is happening to our world?\u201d Weirdly enough, the final scene with Plaza and De Niro in the latter character\u2019s apartment does contain some rather good one-liners, which I have to assume were concocted by Plaza in an improv situation, as their verbal wit is so manifestly superior to any other spoken joke in the movie that the contrast is, again, embarrassing.\u00a0 The actor Bela Lugosi appeared in some landmark, perhaps even great, films at the beginning of his Hollywood career in the 1930s.

{"Title": "The Beguiled", "Stars": 3.5, "Review": "The women stand on the front steps of a dilapidated Southern plantation house, staring out at the muddy road beyond the gate, a road traversed back and forth by battered Confederate troops, heading towards or away from the fluctuating \"front.\" Outside the gates is all restless movement, inside the gates is stasis. Sofia Coppola's \"The Beguiled\"\u2014a remake (sort of) of the 1971 Don Siegel/Clint Eastwood film\u2014is full of such tableaux. The \"meaning\" is not explicit in the images, although you could read plenty into it if you wanted to (the women are glimpsed between the iron bars of the gate, isolated from the world of men, etc). With its title-card gigantic in a swirling pink font, like a flourishing header in the diary of a melodramatic teenage girl, \"The Beguiled\" is a fairy tale, where beautiful spirited women and girls\u2014flawed and filled with contradictory impulses\u2014are locked away from the larger world (some by choice, others because they have nowhere else to go), and how a man disrupts their quiet; how much turbulence a man can bring. Gorgeously shot by Philippe Le Sourd (in his first collaboration with Coppola), \"The Beguiled\" lingers on its images, allows us time to settle into them. Advertisement The film opens with a haunting sequence where a child of 11 (Oona Laurence) gathers mushrooms in a quiet wood. The air is shattered by distant cannon fire. She then discovers the wounded John McBurney (Colin Farrell), a Union soldier who fled his regiment when the battle was at its height, an unmanly act of which he is ashamed. The child decides to take him back to the girls' school where she lives (\"Any men about?\" McBurney asks her). The school is run by Martha Farnsworth (Nicole Kidman), and there are only 5 students left, as well as the teacher, Edwina (frequent Coppola collaborator Kirsten Dunst). Terrified of \"their\" soldiers discovering their harboring of an enemy, they lock McBurney up in the downstairs music room, and Martha, with a briskness covering up her fluttery reaction to McBurney's presence, tends to his leg wound, bathing him, the scene unfolding in a series of lovingly erotic shots of Farrell's chest, forearms, calves, neck. Meanwhile, all through the house, the students\u2014especially the languid Alicia (Elle Fanning), a teenager but already over-ripened, flushed with need and bored out of her mind\u2014huddle by the door, trying to get at least a brief glimpse of the HUNK lying half-clothed on the fainting couch in the dim interior. Coppola really revels in the humor of the situation, treating it affectionately, the students suddenly appearing with pearl earrings in their ears, or dressing up, or sneaking in to give him gifts. Miss Martha looks at all of this in horror and tries to control the situation. But hormones gonna hormone. (Martha is completely male-phobic in the book. Coppola treats it with a lighter touch.) Thomas Cullinan's 1966 novel (originally titled A Painted Devil) was the basis for the 1971 film, made in the same year as \"Dirty Harry.\" The 1971 film is an entertaining rooster-in-a-henhouse fantasy, wrapped in Southern Gothic histrionics, featuring incest, bed-hopping, amputation, poison, not to mention multiple shots of Eastwood's smooth exposed chest. Director Don Siegel said the film was about \"the basic desire of women to castrate men,\" a pretty clear expression of male anxiety in that particular era. Coppola's adaptation removes quite a bit from the original source material as well as from the earlier film (there's been a lot of controversy about her editing out Matilda, the slave who works at the school, but the absence of the incest sub-plot is even more radical, considering what a large role it plays in the original story.) In the multi-narrator book, Edwina, who forms a special bond with McBurney (the problem is, he forms a special bond with each of them), muses: \"Each rumble of the cannons, each swirl of smoke, was a sign of great trouble ... spreading like ripples in a stream to villages and towns and solitary lonely houses all over the land. Perhaps the trouble of the wounded boy would spread and infect people far away from here.\" Advertisement McBurney symbolizes a different thing to each one of them, and he's a shape-shifter, sometimes friendly, or flirty, sometimes polite, sometimes earnest. Farrell, a gifted and fluid actor, is perfect for this role, and it's difficult to imagine another actor pulling it off. You can't manufacture charm like that. Kidman and Durst are both funny and intense, tag-teaming Martha's steel-magnolia energy with Edwina's ladylike delicacy. Fanning, one of the best young actresses working today, is teenage yearning in the flesh, her lazy gestures suggesting restlessness bordering on explosion. The film suffers a bit from the absence of melodrama (particularly in the case of Martha's backstory), but if you didn't know the original or if you hadn't read the book then that might not matter. This is Coppola's film with Coppola's fingerprint. She is interested in the fleeting, in things not easily said, and here she is interested in the ridiculousness of repressing the sex drive (at one point, Edwina is so turned on she almost collapses against a wall). The film is about that house, the pewter-toned light inside, the way the sunset catches the tops of the columns, the women floating through the overgrown yard, the younger girls lying in the same bed, limbs intertwined, practically a Coppola signature at this point. The interior is the female realm, where women dominate and the male lies in repose, to be gawked at and fussed over. The women are powerful and resourceful (\"Edwina, bring me the anatomy book\") but ready to tear each other apart to get to that man in the room. Coppola is not all that interested in explicit commentary or contextualizing larger issues; her interests lie in the peripheral; in what happens when things get quiet; in the way bodies arrange themselves in the frame. You can see it in all of her films. The teenage girl sneaking a peek at V.C. Andrews' \"Flowers in the Attic,\" propped on her slender thighs in \"Lick the Star,\" Coppola's first short film. The five blonde sisters flopped in a pigpile of long limbs and long hair in \"The Virgin Suicides.\" The young woman curled up on the windowsill in her hotel room, her body floating over the cityscape below in \"Lost in Translation.\" The identical strippers in \"Somewhere\" twirling around poles, their bodies undulating in a surreal and almost serene beauty. The teenage burglar in \"The Bling Ring\" dabbing her throat with perfume, staring at her reflection in a trance so deep it is disconnected from reality. These moments don't \"lead anywhere,\" but still, they have enormous resonance. You can't write a thesis statement about what \"The Beguiled\" is about. It's not that kind of movie. But it's the kind of movie that lingers on in your head, just like the best fairy tales do. Advertisement", "Critic": "Alpha"}
